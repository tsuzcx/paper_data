We consider a cognitive radio network where multiple secondary users attempt to access a spectrum hole according to a predefined time division multiple access (TDMA) access rule based on the primary user activities, the channel quality and the transmission delay of each user. Scalable video rate and distortion models are used in formulating the problem as a switching control dynamic Markovian game. The video sources and channel behavior are modeled as independent Markov processes. However, the interaction between users is combined in the access rule thus resulting in a switching control game.

The standard tool for checking observability is the observability rank condition but this only gives a yes or no answer. It does not measure how observable or unobservable the system is. Moreover it requires the ability to differentiate the dynamics and the observations. We introduce new tools, the local unobservability index and the local estimation condition number, to measure the degree of observability or unobservability of a system. To compute these one only needs the ability to simulate the system. We apply these tools to find the best location to put a sensor to observe the flow induced by two point vortices.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400067.pdf","startPage":"6401","endPage":"6406","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measures of unobservability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observability","Trajectory","Linear approximation","Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unobservability measures","observed nonlinear dynamics","output trajectory","observability checking","observability rank condition","unobservability index","estimation condition number"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Measures of unobservability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400067/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11148561","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measures of unobservability","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05538S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5400118,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden","Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yang","id":"38182827100"},{"name":"Yanyan Shen","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37400480300"},{"name":"Gang Feng","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37280824100"},{"name":"Xinping Guan","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Information, and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Guan","id":"37275635400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400118","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","Power system relaying","Decoding","Niobium","Radio spectrum management","Base stations","Protocols","Constraint theory","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","game theory","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA relay network","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access","decode-and-forward relaying strategy","Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining theory","Nash bargaining problem","multiuser diversity"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies fair resource allocation schemes for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) with the decode-and-forward relaying strategy. To satisfy the heterogenous rate requirement of each user while considering the fairness and efficiency as performance indices, the bargaining theory is applied to allocate resource at a relay node to multiple source nodes. Motivated by the fact that each source's achievable rate on individual sub-carrier is limited by decodability constraint, we apply the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining (KSB) theory to allocate resource at the relay fairly. KSB ensures that all sources incur the same surplus rate penalty relative to the maximal surplus rate. To improve system efficiency, the Nash bargaining (NB) problem is formulated to maximize NB solution fairness criterion by exploiting multiuser diversity. A simple yet efficient algorithm is derived to assign sub-carrier and power at the relay for multiple users. Simulation results demonstrate that both KSB-based solution and NB solution can improve total rates while maintaining fairness among sources.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400118","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","startPage":"585","endPage":"590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair resource allocation using bargaining over OFDMA relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fair resource allocation using bargaining over OFDMA relay networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400118/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11148655","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5400118/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair resource allocation using bargaining over OFDMA relay networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076174S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5400136,"authors":[{"name":"Peter I.

We combine the new estimator with previously reported results and apply the algorithm in simulation to actual data obtained through a raster-scan image of DNA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atomic force microscopy","Maximum likelihood detection","DNA","Time measurement","Atomic measurements","Maximum likelihood estimation","Instruments","Open loop systems","Evolution (biology)","Mechanical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","biomedical imaging","maximum likelihood detection","maximum likelihood estimation","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection scheme","atomic force microscopy","sample detection scheme","nonraster scanning","maximum likelihood estimator","string-like sample rapid imaging","DNA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400136","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400136.pdf","startPage":"8290","endPage":"8295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A maximum-likelihood detection scheme for rapid imaging of string-like samples in atomic force microscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A maximum-likelihood detection scheme for rapid imaging of string-like samples in atomic force microscopy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400136/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400136/","accessionNumber":"11148673","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum-likelihood detection scheme for rapid imaging of string-like samples in atomic force microscopy","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048945S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5400146,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Wang","affiliation":["Marine Engineering College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Wang","id":"37401667700"},{"name":"Xianyao Meng","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xianyao","lastName":"Meng","id":"37336496900"},{"name":"Qingyang Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Qingyang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085349584"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400146","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400146","abstract":"In this paper, a novel online self-constructing approach, named fast and parsimonious fuzzy neural network (FPFNN), which emerges the pruning strategy into the growing criteria, is proposed for a function approximator.

Due to the inherent nonlinear parametrizaton nature of the unknown dead-zone nonlinearity, existing robust adaptive control methods have been focusing on using various linearly parametrized models with on-line parameter adaptation for an approximate inversion of the unknown dead-zone nonlinearity. As a result, even in the absence of other uncertain nonlinearities and disturbances, asymptotic output tracking can never be achieved. Departing from those approximate dead-zone compensations, this paper makes full use of the fact that, though not being linearly parametrized globally, the unknown dead-zone nonlinearity can be linearly parametrized within certain known working ranges. Thus indirect parameter estimation algorithms with on-line condition monitoring can be employed for an accurate estimation of the unknown dead-zone nonlinearity. With these accurate estimates of dead-zone parameters, perfect dead-zone compensation is then constructed and utilized in the development of an integrated direct/indirect adaptive robust control algorithm for the overall system. Consequently, asymptotic output tracking is achieved even in the presence of unknown dead-zone nonlinearity. Furthermore, the proposed DIARC achieves certain guaranteed robust transient performance and final tracking accuracy even when the overall system may be subjected to other uncertain nonlinearities and time-varying disturbances. Comparative simulation results obtained validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400179","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400179.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400179","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","startPage":"6626","endPage":"6631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated direct/indirect adaptive robust control of a class of nonlinear systems preceded by unknown dead-zone nonlinearity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Integrated direct/indirect adaptive robust control of a class of nonlinear systems preceded by unknown dead-zone nonlinearity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400179/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400179/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11148758","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated direct/indirect adaptive robust control of a class of nonlinear systems preceded by unknown dead-zone nonlinearity","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076314S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5400213,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hong Zhu","affiliation":["Canadian Space Agency, Saint-Hubert, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wen-Hong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37334065500"},{"name":"Tom Lamarche","affiliation":["Canadian Space Agency, Saint-Hubert, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Lamarche","id":"37398666700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400213","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Haptic interfaces","Accelerometers","Frequency","Acceleration","Quantization","Position measurement","Sampling methods","Stability","Virtual environment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration measurement","accelerometers","damping","encoding","haptic interfaces","stability","velocity measurement","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-stiffness environment emulation","damping coefficient","damping enhancement","encoders","stability","virtual contact","position measurements","acceleration measurements","velocity","accelerometer","one-degree of freedom haptic device","virtual wall"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400213","abstract":"High-stiffness environment emulation requires a haptic device to have a large damping coefficient in order to keep the stability during a virtual contact.

chassis-number recognition using artificial neural networks","abstract":"The automatic detection and recognition of car number plates has become an important application of artificial vision systems. Since the license plates can be replaced, stolen or simply tampered with, they are not the ultimate answer for vehicle identification. The objective is to develop a system whereby vehicle identification number (VIN) or vehicle chassis number is digitally photographed, and then identified electronically by segmenting the characters from the embossed VIN. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for vehicle chassis number identification based on optical character recognition (OCR) using artificial neural network. The algorithm is tested on over thousand vehicle images of different ambient illumination. While capturing these images, the VIN was kept in-focus, while the angle of view and the distance from the vehicle varied according to the experimental setup. These images were subjected to pre-processing which comprises of some standard image processing algorithms. The resultant images were then fed to the proposed OCR system. The OCR system is a three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) with topology 504-600-10. The major achievement of this work is the rate of correct identification, which is 95.49% with zero false identification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400240/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11135658","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400240/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"11-12 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"OCR-based chassis-number recognition using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OCR-based chassis-number recognition using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"1569242840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113172S","chronDate":"11-12 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384536","isNumber":"5400182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384536","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5400182","articleId":"5400240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5400278,"authors":[{"name":"Sertac Karaman","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sertac","lastName":"Karaman","id":"37304113000"},{"name":"Emilio Frazzoli","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Frazzoli","id":"37283368500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400278","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":674},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system planning","Control systems","Logic","Control system synthesis","Embedded system","Robots","Motion planning","Trajectory","Power system modeling","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","iterative methods","nonlinear dynamical systems","path planning","probability","sampling methods","temporal logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling based motion planning","control program online computation","dynamical system","temporal logic specification","provably correct control program","point-to-point motion planning","finite transition system","dynamically feasible trajectory","iteration method","probabilistic completeness","deterministic \u03bc-calculus specification","local \u03bc-calculus model checking method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400278","abstract":"In this paper, we propose algorithms for the on-line computation of control programs for dynamical systems that provably satisfy a class of temporal logic specifications.

The proposed algorithms, generalizing state-of-the-art algorithms for point-to-point motion planning, incrementally build finite transition systems representing a discrete subset of dynamically feasible trajectories. At each iteration, local \u03bc-calculus model-checking methods are used to establish whether the current transition system satisfies the specifications. Efficient sampling strategies are presented, ensuring the probabilistic completeness of the algorithms.

This paper proposes an alternative distributed approach based on a Newton-type method for solving minimum cost network optimization problems. The key component of the method is to represent the dual Newton direction as the solution of a discrete Poisson equation involving the graph Laplacian. This representation enables using an iterative consensus-based local averaging scheme (with an additional input term) to compute the Newton direction based only on local information. We show that even when the iterative schemes used for computing the Newton direction and the stepsize in our method are truncated, the resulting iterates converge superlinearly within an explicitly characterized error neighborhood. Simulation results illustrate the significant performance gains of this method relative to subgradient methods based on dual decomposition.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400289.pdf","startPage":"2736","endPage":"2741","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400289","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400289","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400289","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Newton method","Optimization methods","Cost function","Convergence","Iterative methods","Iterative algorithms","Constraint optimization","Poisson equations","Laplace equations","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","Newton method","optimisation","Poisson equation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed Newton method","minimum cost network optimization problems","discrete Poisson equation","Laplacian graph","iterative consensus-based local averaging scheme","explicitly characterized error neighborhood","dual decomposition method","subgradient method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400289/","displayDocTitle":"A distributed newton method for network optimization","accessionNumber":"11148971","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5400289/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed newton method for network optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070216S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5400312,"authors":[{"name":"Min Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation and the Center for Control and Optimization, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406967100"},{"name":"Shuzhi Sam Ge","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems and Information Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuzhi Sam","lastName":"Ge","id":"37275647400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400312","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Time varying systems","Neural networks","Automatic control","Delay effects","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","approximation theory","closed loop systems","delays","feedback","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","time-varying systems","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation based adaptive tracking control","nonaffine pure feedback nonlinear systems","multiple unknown state time varying delays","adaptive neural tracking control","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","closed loop system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents adaptive neural tracking control for a class of non-affine pure-feedback systems with multiple unknown state time-varying delays.

Packet losses from the sensor to the estimator are assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution, while information loss is not assumed to be available at the receiver at any time. The optimal estimator provides a satisfactory estimate under unreliable communications as the estimator is used successfully in a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller to stabilize an inverted pendulum system, and comparison with an optimal estimator for which information loss at the receiver is available. The optimal estimator for a cognitive radio system is derived. Cognitive radio is an emerging technology with many promising applications. Cognitive radio can be considered as a combination of packet loss with and without acknowledgement in the dynamical model. An illustrative example shows that the optimal estimator improves the performance largely.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11149125","htmlLink":"/document/5400362/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal estimation over unreliable communication links with application to cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal estimation over unreliable communication links with application to cognitive radio","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074263S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5400365,"authors":[{"name":"Wanli Guo","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wanli","lastName":"Guo","id":"37404994900"},{"name":"Shihua Chen","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403390400"},{"name":"Jinhu L\u00fc","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinhu","lastName":"L\u00fc","id":"37278641900"},{"name":"Xinghuo Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Xinghuo","lastName":"Yu","id":"37280835100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400365","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400365","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiagent systems","Numerical simulation","Mathematical model","Symmetric matrices","Mathematics","Laplace equations","Intelligent agent","Biology","Application software","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","multi-agent systems","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","asymmetric adjacency matrix","multiple interacting intelligent agents","active leader","tracking error","numerical simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400365","endPage":"3702","startPage":"3697","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus of multi-agent systems with an active leader and asymmetric adjacency matrix","abstract":"Multi-agent systems (MAS) have received an increasing attention over the past few years.

The newly proposed method was evaluated via experiments in an office building environment. Estimation accuracy is shown to improve significantly when all available data is incorporated in the estimator.

This paper presents an algorithm of Type-II T-S fuzzy (T2TSF) modeling based on data clustering and two approaches to design T2TSF model-based predictive controllers. As the T2TSF model is an extension of T1TSF (Type-I T-S fuzzy) model, the T2TSF modeling algorithm divides the input-output data set into several Type-I fuzzy sets by G-K clustering algorithm at first. As for antecedent in each T2TSF rule, the fluctuation range of the memberships is computed by averaging the membership differences among the similar data, and the Type-I fuzzy set can then be expanded to Type-II fuzzy set. As for consequent in each T2TSF rule, the fluctuation range of the data output sections is computed by averaging the output differences of the data with similar input sections, the crisp coefficients of linear polynomials can then be expanded to interval Type-I fuzzy sets. T2TSF model has two kinds of outputs: crisp value and type-reduced set. Based on these two kinds of outputs and predictive control algorithm, two types of controllers are designed. Controller I is based on crisp output to compute crisp control variable. Controller II is based on the type-reduced set to compute a control variable set, and then the crisp control variable is derived by defuzzifying this set. Simulation results of pH neutralization with uncertainties are provided to confirm that the proposed T2TSF modeling is superior to the T1TSF modeling in terms of accuracy, and Controller I and II can achieve better performance than the predictive controller based on T1TSF model.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400480","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400480.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","startPage":"4193","endPage":"4198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type-II T-S fuzzy model-based predictive control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Type-II T-S fuzzy model-based predictive control","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400480/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11149334","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5400480/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type-II T-S fuzzy model-based predictive control","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053304S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5400511,"authors":[{"name":"Rishi Graham","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rishi","lastName":"Graham","id":"37411343300"},{"name":"Jorge Cort\u00e9s","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Cort\u00e9s","id":"37286603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400511","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Entropy","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Distributed computing","Sea measurements","Bayesian methods","Robot kinematics","Robot sensing systems","Intelligent sensors","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","cooperative systems","entropy","motion control","multi-robot systems","optimisation","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate entropy maximization","cooperative adaptive sampling","mobile sensors","spatiotemporal random field","Bayesian posterior predictive entropy","Taylor series approximation","alternative objective function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400511","abstract":"This work deals with a group of mobile sensors sampling a spatiotemporal random field whose mean is unknown and covariance is known up to a scaling parameter. The Bayesian posterior predictive entropy provides a direct mapping between the locations of a new set of point measurements and the uncertainty of the resulting estimate of the model parameters. Since the posterior predictive entropy and its gradient are not amenable to distributed computation, we propose an alternative objective function based on a Taylor series approximation. We present a distributed strategy for sequential design which ensures that measurements at each timestep are taken at local minima of the objective function. The technical approach builds on a novel reformulation of the posterior predictive entropy.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400511","startPage":"7055","endPage":"7060","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400511.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative adaptive sampling via approximate entropy maximization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative adaptive sampling via approximate entropy maximization","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400511/","accessionNumber":"11149459","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400511/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative adaptive sampling via approximate entropy maximization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069484S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5400520,"authors":[{"name":"Adan Vela","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Adan","lastName":"Vela","id":"37411370400"},{"name":"Senay Solak","affiliation":["Department of Finance and Operations Management Isenberg School of Management, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Senay","lastName":"Solak","id":"37398642000"},{"name":"William Singhose","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Singhose","id":"37327864500"},{"name":"John-Paul Clarke","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"John-Paul","lastName":"Clarke","id":"37340026500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400520","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400520","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Velocity control","Air traffic control","Aircraft","Automatic control","Aerospace control","Traffic control","Europe","FAA","Delay","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","integer programming","linear programming","position control","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flight-level assignment","speed control","air traffic conflict resolution","optimization","speed trajectory","aircraft metering","mixed integer linear program"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400520","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400520.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","startPage":"5219","endPage":"5226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mixed integer program for flight-level assignment and speed control for conflict resolution","abstract":"We consider the air traffic conflict resolution problem and develop an optimization model for generating speed trajectories that minimize the fuel expended to avoid conflicts.

The design objective is a non-classical multicriterion optimization problem for finite horizon, where the cost function consists of the linear quadratic cost reflecting the control performance and a communication cost penalizing information exchange between sensor and controller. It is shown that the joint optimization of scheduling and control can be separated into three subproblems: an optimal regulator problem, an estimation problem and an optimal scheduling problem. The obtained results are extended to TCP-like networks with random packet loss. In the proposed framework, we classify three classes of schedulers, a purely randomized, a deterministic and a state-dependent scheme, and compare their performance by a numerical example.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400528","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400528.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","startPage":"5832","endPage":"5838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On LQG joint optimal scheduling and control under communication constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On LQG joint optimal scheduling and control under communication constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400528/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11149476","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5400528/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On LQG joint optimal scheduling and control under communication constraints","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143303S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5400541,"authors":[{"name":"Manel Velasco","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Velasco","id":"37266090800"},{"name":"Pau Mart\u00ed","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Pau","lastName":"Mart\u00ed","id":"37277828900"},{"name":"Enrico Bini","affiliation":["ReTiS Laboratory, Scuola Superiore Sant'' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Bini","id":"37284743600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400541","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Lyapunov method","Control systems","Automatic control","H infinity control","Computational modeling","Embedded computing","Physics computing","Communication system control","Feedback control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","Lyapunov methods","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov sampling","event-driven controllers","Lyapunov functions","contour curves"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Lyapunov sampling for event-driven controllers","abstract":"This paper investigates an event condition for event-driven controllers based on Lyapunov functions. Considering that constant values of a Lyapunov function define contour curves that form closed regions around the equilibrium point, in this paper we present a sampling mechanism that enforces job executions (sampling, control algorithm computation and actuation) each time the system trajectory reaches a given contour curve. By construction, the sequence of generated samples is stable in the discrete Lyapunov sense. However, in order to ensure that the system trajectory will tend to zero as time tends to infinity, it must be ensured that the sequence of samples is infinite. We provide conditions to ensure this property.

Although there exists computational complexity analysis for current online optimization methods dedicated to MPC, the worst case complexity bound is either hard to compute or far off from the practically observed bound. In this paper we introduce fast gradient methods that allow one to compute a priori the worst case bound required to find a solution with pre-specified accuracy. Both warm- and cold-starting techniques are analyzed and an illustrative example confirms that small, practical bounds can be obtained that together with the algorithmic and numerical simplicity of fast gradient methods allow online optimization at high rates.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400619","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400619.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","startPage":"7387","endPage":"7393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time input-constrained MPC using fast gradient methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time input-constrained MPC using fast gradient methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400619/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11148143","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5400619/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time input-constrained MPC using fast gradient methods","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056963S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5400658,"authors":[{"name":"E.

To achieve this, the engineering process has to be improved through the integration of the tools involved in the development process. To achieve this goal the definition of Markup Languages for factory automation has been proposed at different layers of the engineering process. They allow defining the application from different points of view. Each point of view uses a particular syntax and semantics. Applications are defined by means of a set of view models as well as their relationships. This paper proposes a further step as the mechanisms needed for exchanging information among models are analyzed. They are used in the design of a model collaboration prototype for distributed industrial control systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design automation","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control","Automatic control","Control systems","Markup languages","Manufacturing automation","Information analysis","Collaboration","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control systems","distributed control","industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven design","industrial automation","trustworthy control systems","flexibility","reutilization","markup languages","factory automation","engineering process","syntax","semantics","model collaboration prototype","distributed industrial control system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400658","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400658.pdf","startPage":"6262","endPage":"6267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model driven design in industrial automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model driven design in industrial automation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400658/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400658/","accessionNumber":"11148182","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model driven design in industrial automation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069615S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5400681,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Seuret","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, GIPSA-Lab-CNRS UMR 5216, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Seuret","id":"37298882600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400681","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Time varying systems","Sampling methods","Control systems","Communication system control","Asymptotic stability","Symmetric matrices","Automatic control","Linear systems","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay systems","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","sampled data systems","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled-data systems","linear system","input-delay approach","impulsive system stability","time-varying sampling period","linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampled data controller","Time-delay","delay-dependent stability","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKF)","linear matrix inequality (LMI)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400681","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400681.pdf","startPage":"8130","endPage":"8135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis for sampled-data systems with a time-varying period","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel stability analysis of linear systems with sampled-data inputs.

In contrast to input design with signal power constraints, this problem is non-convex and non-smooth. We propose an iterative solution: in the first step, a convex optimization problem is solved for input design under power constraints. In subsequent steps, the constraints considered are the p-norms of the input and output signals, p increases for each iteration step. This is an adaptation of the classical Po\u00bflya algorithm for function approximation, which has previously been used for the related problem of signal crest-factor optimization. Although the difficulty of the problem prevents a proof of optimality, the performance of the algorithm is discussed with reference to a simple example.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400682","startPage":"1551","endPage":"1556","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400682.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm for amplitude-constrained input design for system identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm for amplitude-constrained input design for system identification","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400682/","accessionNumber":"11148206","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400682/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm for amplitude-constrained input design for system identification","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2730.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058318S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5400837,"authors":[{"name":"Yue-Ping Jiang","affiliation":["School of Natural Sciences, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yue-Ping","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37405112200"},{"name":"Hai-Tao Fang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control Institute of Systems Science Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hai-Tao","lastName":"Fang","id":"37416757900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400837","abstract":"The paper concerns the identification of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Wiener system consisting of a linear subsystem followed by a static nonlinearity.

The policy is to be used by M phased-array radars who coordinate to track the positions of N targets moving according to independent scalar Gauss-Markov linear dynamics, which allows use of the Kalman filter for track estimation. The paper exploits the natural problem formulation as a multiarmed restless bandit problem (MARBP) with real-state projects subject to deterministic dynamics by deploying Whittle's (1988) index policy for the MARBP. The challenging issues of indexability (existence of the index) and index evaluation are resolved by applying a method recently introduced by the first author for the analysis of real-state restless bandits. Preliminary computational results are reported demonstrating the tractability of index evaluation and comparing the MP index policy against myopic policies advocated in previous work.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400949","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400949.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400949","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","startPage":"2905","endPage":"2910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitarget tracking via restless bandit marginal productivity indices and Kalman filter in discrete time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multitarget tracking via restless bandit marginal productivity indices and Kalman filter in discrete time","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5400949/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5400949/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11148385","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitarget tracking via restless bandit marginal productivity indices and Kalman filter in discrete time","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061689S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5400949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5400951,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Wu","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Mechanical and MechatronicEngineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407334500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5400951","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Control systems","Signal sampling","Wireless sensor networks","Delta-sigma modulation","Pulse width modulation converters","Communication system control","Frequency","Actuators","Delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulation","radio networks","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-bit processing","wireless networked real-time control","delta-sigma modulation sensing","one-bit register","control law","one-bit control signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["one-bit processing","real-time control","Delta-Sigma modulation","wireless network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-bit processing for wireless networked real-time control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5400951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","endPage":"2027","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05400951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400951","startPage":"2023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400951","abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach for wireless networked real-time control.

These data sets are characterized by the presence of linearly dependent points (in the kernel space), duplicate points, or nearly duplicate points. Such data sets are quite common among many real-world data, especially those with nominal features. Other contributions of this paper include a unifying formulation of the tracking process in the form of a linear programming problem, update formula for the linear programs, considerations that guard against accumulation of errors resulting from the use of incremental updates, and routines to speed up the algorithm.

Since resistance in a set state tended to decrease due to the history effect of the lowest resistance, multilevel operation with a controlled set resistance was found to be difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the reset resistance could be controlled accurately by varying the reset voltage. The switching mechanism, the tunnel barrier of which is regenerated to cut off the filament, obtains the high repeatability of the reset resistance. As a result, a four-level storage ReRAM was successfully demonstrated with multireset level operation. In addition, the set voltage was found to strongly depend on reset resistance. Preventing reset resistance from exceeding 1 G\u00bf achieved a low-set-voltage operation below 5 V.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2039021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2009.2039021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/5419202/05401057.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resistance Controllability of - Stack ReRAM for Low-Voltage and Multilevel Operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Resistance Controllability of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{Ta}_{2} \\hbox{O}_{5}/\\hbox{TiO}_{2}$</tex></formula> Stack ReRAM for Low-Voltage and Multilevel Operation","volume":"31","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142213","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401057/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resistance Controllability of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{Ta}_{2} \\hbox{O}_{5}/\\hbox{TiO}_{2}$</tex></formula> Stack ReRAM for Low-Voltage and Multilevel Operation","sourcePdf":"led-terai-2039021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053173S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5419202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5419202","articleId":"5401057","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5401061,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Afanasyev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","CSIRO, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5602023/5401061/5401061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mikhail Afanasyev received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California at Berkeley in 2004, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of California at San Diego in 2007 and 2009, respectively.","He is a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Brisbane, Australia.

In urban environments, the WiFi mesh frequently supplements a number of existing access technologies, including wired broadband networks, 3G cellular, and commercial WiFi hotspots. It is an open question what role citywide WiFi deployments play in the increasingly diverse access network spectrum. We study the usage of the Google WiFi network deployed in Mountain View, CA, and find that usage naturally falls into three classes based almost entirely on client device type, which we divide into traditional laptop users, fixed-location access devices, and PDA-like smartphone devices. Moreover, each of these classes of use has significant geographic locality, following the distribution of residential, commercial, and transportation areas of the city. When comparing the network usage of each device class, we find a diverse set of mobility patterns that map well to the archetypal use cases for traditional access technologies. To help place our results in context, we also provide key performance measurements of the mesh backbone and, where possible, compare them to those of previously studied urban mesh networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2040087","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5602023/05401061.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2040087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5602023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Usage Patterns in an Urban WiFi Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Usage Patterns in an Urban WiFi Network","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5401061/","accessionNumber":"11581318","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Usage Patterns in an Urban WiFi Network","sourcePdf":"tnet-asnoeren-2040087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100437S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5602023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5602023","articleId":"5401061","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5401062,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Paolieri","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, and theDAC, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Paolieri","id":"37297288900"},{"name":"Eduardo Quinones","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Quinones","id":"38180769800"},{"name":"Francisco J.

It should be noted that this paper is not a comparison of various channel estimation techniques (i.e., trained versus semiblind versus blind), but an assessment of 1) whether a blind estimation technique is feasible with the HomePlug power-line standard and 2) to determine its effectiveness in a typical power-line setting.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5738430/05401071.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"763","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2038477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2038477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation for HomePlug Power-Line Communications: A Feasibility?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation for HomePlug Power-Line Communications: A Feasibility?","htmlLink":"/document/5401071/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11883308","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Channel Estimation for HomePlug Power-Line Communications: A Feasibility?","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-meng-2038477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081567S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5738430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5738430","articleId":"5401071","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5401072,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Siegl","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Informations\u00fcbertragung, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcmberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5464420/5401072/5401072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Siegl was born in Munich, Germany, in 1980.

In this paper, asymptotic performance analysis of SLM is carried out and a bound on the maximum tolerable PAR values is derived. Starting with the analysis of Gaussian signalling at Nyquist rate, it is also shown that these theoretic results can be applied for QAM signalling at any oversampling rate. Based on the idea to distinguish between tolerable and nontolerable PAR values a novel variant of SLM is derived, namely successive SLM (SSLM). With this approach it is possible to significantly decrease the average number of assessed signal candidates and the average number of required side-information bits per OFDM frame as long as the threshold of tolerable PAR values is larger than the critical PAR ( for Nyquist sampled signals). As a rule of thumb, less than 2.71 (Euler's number) candidates and less than 2.57 bits of side-information are required on average.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Performance Analysis and Successive Selected Mapping for PAR Reduction in OFDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2041869","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05401072.pdf","startPage":"3228","endPage":"3237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2041869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Performance Analysis and Successive Selected Mapping for PAR Reduction in OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5401072/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304797","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Performance Analysis and Successive Selected Mapping for PAR Reduction in OFDM","sourcePdf":"58tsp05-csiegl-2041869-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098915S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5401072","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5401073,"authors":[{"name":"Yiannis Davilis","affiliation":["Athens Information Technology Center, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5475408/5401073/5401073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiannis Davilis was born in Athens, Greece, in 1985.

The full control of transmission assets are not currently built into electric network optimization models. Optimal transmission switching is a straightforward way to leverage grid controllability: to make better use of the existing system and meet growing demand with existing infrastructure. Previous papers have shown that optimizing the network topology improves the dispatch of electrical networks. Such optimal topology dispatch can be categorized as a smart grid application where there is a co-optimization of both generators and transmission topology. In this paper we present a co-optimization formulation of the generation unit commitment and transmission switching problem while ensuring N-1 reliability. We show that the optimal topology of the network can vary from hour to hour. We also show that optimizing the topology can change the optimal unit commitment schedule. This problem is large and computationally complex even for medium sized systems. We present decomposition and computational approaches to solving this problem.

Despite its appealing features, this technology inevitably complicates the synchronization task, which must be accomplished in an environment that may involve interference. This paper considers the uplink of an orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)-based spectrum sharing system and provides solutions for estimating the frequency and timing errors of multiple unsynchronized users. In doing so, we exploit suitably designed training blocks and apply maximum likelihood methods after modeling the interference power on each subcarrier as a random variable with an inverse gamma distribution. The resulting frequency estimator turns out to be the extension to a multiuser scenario of a scheme that has previously been proposed for single-user spectrum-sharing systems. Timing recovery is more challenging and leads to a complete search over a multidimensional domain. To overcome such a difficulty, two alternative approaches are proposed. The first one relies on a simplifying assumption about the interference distribution in the frequency domain, while the second scheme operates in an iterative fashion according to the expectation-maximization algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2041867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05401081.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2041867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","startPage":"2771","endPage":"2782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Synchronization in OFDMA Spectrum-Sharing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Synchronization in OFDMA Spectrum-Sharing Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401081/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11228732","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5401081/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Synchronization in OFDMA Spectrum-Sharing Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-sanguinetti-2041867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09871S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5401081","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5401083,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Pantelopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5475408/5401083/5401083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandros Pantelopoulos (S\u201909) received the Diploma degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Patras, Greece, in 2007.

Although several technological issues regarding WHMS still need to be resolved in order to become more applicable in real-life scenarios, it is expected that continuous ambulatory monitoring of vital signs will enable proactive personal health management and better treatment of patients suffering from chronic diseases, of the elderly population, and of emergency situations. In this paper, we present a physiological data fusion model for multisensor WHMS called Prognosis. The proposed methodology is based on a fuzzy regular language for the generation of the prognoses of the health conditions of the patient, whereby the current state of the corresponding fuzzy finite-state machine signifies the current estimated health state and context of the patient. The operation of the proposed scheme is explained via detailed examples in hypothetical scenarios. Finally, a stochastic Petri net model of the human-device interaction is presented, which illustrates how additional health status feedback can be obtained from the WHMS' user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401083/","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5401083/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11328249","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"20123575","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"<emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Prognosis</emphasis>\u2014A Wearable Health-Monitoring System for People at Risk: Methodology and Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Prognosis</emphasis>\u2014A Wearable Health-Monitoring System for People at Risk: Methodology and Modeling","sourcePdf":"titb-pantelopoulos-2040085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135182S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5475408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5475408","articleId":"5401083","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5401090,"authors":[{"name":"Keir C.

Noise in an ADC is due to thermal processes, quantization, and clock jitter. In an array of ADCs, thermal and quantization noise are independently generated in each ADC, but if a common clock is used, its jitter will generate correlated sampling noise in all the ADCs in the array. In this paper, we analyze and experimentally measure the impact of previously proposed harmonic decorrelation techniques on the sampling noise of an array of parallel ADCs driven by a common clock, sampling at an intermediate frequency. Both theory and experiments reveal that the decorrelation techniques reduce the total sampling noise by half, which is a result that could substantially relax clock requirements for high-dynamic-range systems and thus reduce clock costs.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2036344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2036344","startPage":"2272","endPage":"2279","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5545546/05401090.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5545546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Decorrelation Techniques on Sampling Noise in Radio-Frequency Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Decorrelation Techniques on Sampling Noise in Radio-Frequency Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","volume":"59","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401090/","accessionNumber":"11464119","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401090/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Decorrelation Techniques on Sampling Noise in Radio-Frequency Applications","sourcePdf":"tim-lauritzen-2036344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061159S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5545546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5545546","articleId":"5401090","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5401094,"authors":[{"name":"Liangyu Ma","affiliation":["Department of Automation, School of Control Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5467345/5401094/5401094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liangyu Ma received the B.S. degree in thermal power engineering, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from North China Electric Power University (NCEPU), Baoding, China, in 1993, 1996, and 2004, respectively.","From March 2008 to February 2009, he was a Visiting Scholar at Baylor University, Waco, TX.

However, it is a difficult task due to the structural complexity of a thermal system, varying degree of severity of a fault, and the wide range of operation of the power generating unit. An artificial neural network combined with optimal zoom search is proposed in this paper for recognizing varying degrees of faults in a power plant thermal system operating at different load level. The zoom search technology is based on the similarity rules of the feature variables to a same fault with different severity when the system topological structure does not change with fault or with different loading conditions. Two different types of symptoms, a trend symptom and a semantic symptom, are calculated and jointly used for on-line fault recognition, which results in a faster and more stable fault diagnosis. A feedforward neural network structure is adopted and an improved training method is introduced. A high-pressure feedwater heater system is taken as a target system for investigation. Several simulation tests for diagnosing a multidegree fault under different operating conditions are carried out on a 300-MW power plant simulator to demonstrate the validity of the method.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2037435","startPage":"546","endPage":"554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2037435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5467345","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5467345/05401094.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intelligent Power Plant Fault Diagnostics for Varying Degree of Severity and Loading Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401094/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Intelligent Power Plant Fault Diagnostics for Varying Degree of Severity and Loading Conditions","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5401094/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11313641","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intelligent Power Plant Fault Diagnostics for Varying Degree of Severity and Loading Conditions","sourcePdf":"tec-ma-2037435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092524S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5467345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5467345","articleId":"5401094","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5401095,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Hee Han","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA","Caterpillar, Inc., Peoria, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5416618/5401095/5401095-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seok-Hee Han (M\u201907) was born in Seoul, Korea.

The significance of slot harmonics and the benefits of stators with odd number of slots per pole pair are highlighted. Based on these valuable analytical insights, this paper proposes coordination of the selection of stators with odd number of slots per pole pair and IPM rotors with multiple layers of flux barriers in order to reduce torque ripple. The effectiveness of using stators with odd number of slots per pole pair in reducing torque ripple is validated by applying a finite-element-based Monte Carlo optimization method to four IPM machine topologies, which are combinations of two stator topologies (even or odd number of slots per pole pair) and two IPM rotor topologies (one- or two-layer). It is demonstrated that the torque ripple can be reduced to less than 5% by selecting a stator with an odd number of slots per pole pair and the IPM rotor with optimized barrier configurations, without using stator/rotor skewing or rotor pole shaping.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401095/","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5401095/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138239","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Torque Ripple Reduction in Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Using Stators With Odd Number of Slots Per Pole Pair","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque Ripple Reduction in Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Using Stators With Odd Number of Slots Per Pole Pair","sourcePdf":"tec-han-2033196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061585S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5416618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5416618","articleId":"5401095","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5401099,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Li","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5742819/5401099/5401099-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Teng Li received the B.Eng. degree in automation from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2001, the M.Eng. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, in 2010.","His current research interests include visual categorization, multimedia retrieval, machine learning, and computer vision."]},"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Li","id":"37075664900"},{"name":"Tao Mei","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5742819/5401099/5401099-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Mei received the B.E. degree in automation and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He joined Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China, as a Researcher Staff Member in 2006.

Conventional BOW neglects the contextual relations between local patches due to its Na\u00efve Bayesian assumption. However, it is well known that contextual relations play an important role for human beings to recognize visual categories from their local appearance. This paper proposes a novel contextual bag-of-words (CBOW) representation to model two kinds of typical contextual relations between local patches, i.e., a semantic conceptual relation and a spatial neighboring relation. To model the semantic conceptual relation, visual words are grouped on multiple semantic levels according to the similarity of class distribution induced by them, accordingly local patches are encoded and images are represented. To explore the spatial neighboring relation, an automatic term extraction technique is adopted to measure the confidence that neighboring visual words are relevant. Word groups with high relevance are used and their statistics are incorporated into the BOW representation. Classification is taken using the support vector machine with an efficient kernel to incorporate the relational information. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated on two kinds of visual categorization tasks, i.e., video event and scene categorization. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of contextual relations of local patches and the CBOW shows superior performance to conventional BOW.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2041828","startPage":"381","endPage":"392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2041828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5742819","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5742819/05401099.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contextual Bag-of-Words for Visual Categorization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401099/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Contextual Bag-of-Words for Visual Categorization","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5401099/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11909997","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contextual Bag-of-Words for Visual Categorization","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-tli-2041828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116558S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5742819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5742819","articleId":"5401099","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5401103,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Min Lin","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279528900"},{"name":"Po-Lung Tien","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering/Computer Science/Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Lung","lastName":"Tien","id":"37268956500"},{"name":"Maria C.

To this end, we establish a noninvasive collaboration model on the Grid layer which requires minimal information about the participating High Performance and High Throughput Computing (HPC/HTC) centers and which leaves the local resource managers completely untouched. In this environment of fully autonomous sites, independent users are assumed to submit their jobs to the Grid middleware layer of their local site, which in turn decides on the delegation and execution either on the local system or on remote sites in a situation-dependent, adaptive way. We find for different scenarios that the exchange policies show good performance characteristics not only with respect to traditional metrics such as average weighted response time and utilization, but also in terms of robustness and stability in changing environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401153/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11447033","volume":"21","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Load Delegation in Service Grid Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Load Delegation in Service Grid Environments","sourcePdf":"ttd2010091304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076009S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5522945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5522945","articleId":"5401153","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5401160,"authors":[{"name":"Voicu Popescu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/5506919/5401160/5401160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Voicu Popescu received the BS degree in computer science from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 1995, and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in 2001.

For remote visualization, we describe a GPC that allows zooming-in at the client without the need for transferring additional data from the server. For focus-plus-context visualization, we describe a GPC with multiple regions of interest with sampling rate continuity to the surrounding areas. For extreme antialiasing, we describe a GPC variant that allows supersampling locally with a very high number of color samples per output pixel (e.g., 1,024\u00d7), supersampling levels that are out of reach for conventional approaches that supersample the entire image. The GPC supports many types of data, including surface geometry, volumetric, and image data, as well as many rendering modes, including highly view-dependent effects such as volume rendering. Finally, GPC visualization is efficient-GPC images are rendered and resampled with the help of graphics hardware at interactive rates.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.22","startPage":"777","endPage":"790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5506919/05401160.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5506919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The General Pinhole Camera: Effective and Efficient Nonuniform Sampling for Visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"The General Pinhole Camera: Effective and Efficient Nonuniform Sampling for Visualization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2010","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401160/","accessionNumber":"11429466","pubMedId":"20616393","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401160/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The General Pinhole Camera: Effective and Efficient Nonuniform Sampling for Visualization","sourcePdf":"ttg2010050777.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093714S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5506919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5506919","articleId":"5401160","onlineDate":"29 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5401163,"authors":[{"name":"Debashis Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5611449/5401163/5401163-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Debashis Ghosh received the BE degree in electronics and communication engineering from M.R.

In a multiscript, multilingual environment, it is essential to know the script used in writing a document before an appropriate character recognition and document analysis algorithm can be chosen. In view of this, several methods for automatic script identification have been developed so far. They mainly belong to two broad categories-structure-based and visual-appearance-based techniques. This survey report gives an overview of the different script identification methodologies under each of these categories. Methods for script identification in online data and video-texts are also presented.

However, to avoid trivial solutions, certain blocks must be assigned locations on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) fabric prior to optimization. A simple way to achieve this is to assign blocks randomly. However, this does not always result in the best solution. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, called ShrubPlace, for pre-assigning I/O blocks to I/O pads around the perimeter of the FPGA. To verify the efficacy of our pre-placement algorithm, we integrated the algorithm into the analytic placer. When tested with the 20 MCNC benchmarks, our results show a reduction in wirelength is possible, with very little additional execution time required to perform the pre-placement.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400049/5401179/05401183.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Graph-Based I/O Pad Pre-placement Technique for Use with Analytic FPGA Placement Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Logic","Simulated annealing","Algorithm design and analysis","Design automation","Analytical models","Wire","Very large scale integration","Computer science","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I/O pad pre-placement technique","analytic FPGA placement methods","field programmable gate array","ShrubPlace algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Analytic Placement","I/O-Pad Pre-assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Graph-Based I/O Pad Pre-placement Technique for Use with Analytic FPGA Placement Methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401183/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11162383","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Graph-Based I/O Pad Pre-placement Technique for Use with Analytic FPGA Placement Methods","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"3928a063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062105S","chronDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5400049","isNumber":"5401179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400049","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5401179","articleId":"5401183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5401184,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhao","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403479500"},{"name":"Ryan Sturmer","affiliation":["Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc., NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Sturmer","id":"37396934100"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc., NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"},{"name":"Vamsee K.

In this regard, reversible logic has become an immensely promising technology in the field of low power computing and designing. On the other hand, data shifting and rotating are required in many operations such as arithmetic and logical operations, address decoding and indexing etc. In this consequence, barrel shifters, which can shift and rotate multiple bits in a single cycle, have become a common design choice for high speed applications. For this reason, this paper presents an efficient design of a reversible barrel shifter.

Optical proximity correction (OPC) is a layout distortion technique to improve printed image. During manufacturing, parameters such as focus, dose and resist thickness may vary within tolerance margins. These factors contribute to additional distortion of expected printed shape, not addressed directly by OPC. To ensure a robust IC, a process window consideration is extremely important while running lithography simulations as we scale the technology even further, where the sensitivity of patterns printed on silicon to process variations is very high. Optical Lithography simulation has always been an important link in the chain for Design for manufacturability (DFM) and a lot of research has been put into making it faster and more accurate. However, being a compute intensive process, speeding up litho simulation without significant compromise in accuracy has always been tricky. In this paper we propose a new method to approximate litho simulation based on wavelet transform as opposed to the traditional method employed and we validate the speed and accuracy of our simulator by comparing our results with those of a popular commercial Lithography simulator considering focus variations. While our simulator suffers from an RMS error of < 6%, the major gains are (1) an increase in simulation speed of > 20X and (2) the ability to simulate very large circuit masks where the commercial software fails and direct incorporation of (3) manufacturing process variation. This allows litho simulation against multiple manufacturing process corners, which in turn helps in producing robust design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Lithography Simulation with Focus Variation using Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.67","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400049/5401179/05401217.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optical Lithography Simulation with Focus Variation using Wavelet Transform","conferenceDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401217/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11102460","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Lithography Simulation with Focus Variation using Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"3928a387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076401S","chronDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5400049","isNumber":"5401179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400049","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5401179","articleId":"5401217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5401222,"authors":[{"name":"Ritochit Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Ritochit","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37393433800"},{"name":"Arun V.

Moreover, macromodels obviate the need for topology exploration and parametric RLC model generation via optimization for on-chip passives. The co-synthesis framework is enabled by nonlinear, hyper-dimensional regression for macromodel generation and a simulated annealing based optimization scheme. As examples, and to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, two standard low-noise amplifier topologies are synthesized with tight performance constraints by co-optimization of circuit parameters and inductor geometries.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","RLC circuits","Circuit simulation","Inductors","Circuit synthesis","Circuit topology","Acceleration","Electromagnetic induction","Spirals","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","circuit optimisation","integrated circuit modelling","passive networks","radiofrequency integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-gigahertz radio frequency circuits","three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation technology","Maxwell-accurate parametric macromodels","SPICE","parametric RLC model generation","on-chip passives","regression analysis","low-noise amplifier","circuit parameters optimization","active-passive co-synthesis","simulated annealing","inductor geometries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parametric Macromodel","Algorithm","Ensemble Learning","Active-Passive Co-Synthesis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.38","publicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400049/5401179/05401222.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Active-Passive Co-synthesis of Multi-gigaHertz Radio Frequency Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Active-Passive Co-synthesis of Multi-gigaHertz Radio Frequency Circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401222/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401222/","accessionNumber":"11133965","conferenceDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Active-Passive Co-synthesis of Multi-gigaHertz Radio Frequency Circuits","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"3928a381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054217S","chronDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5400049","isNumber":"5401179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400049","xplore-issue":"5401179","articleId":"5401222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5401223,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Gupta","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37400887700"},{"name":"Suman K.

Knowledge of the optimum stage ratio helps to design low power low mismatch jitter buffers for multi phase clock generation circuits that can drive large load capacitances.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401179","startPage":"152","endPage":"157","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400049/5401179/05401276.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Stage Ratio of Tapered CMOS Inverters for Minimum Power and Mismatch Jitter Product","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5401276/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Stage Ratio of Tapered CMOS Inverters for Minimum Power and Mismatch Jitter Product","conferenceDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11133968","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Stage Ratio of Tapered CMOS Inverters for Minimum Power and Mismatch Jitter Product","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"3928a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061867S","chronDate":"3-7 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5400049","isNumber":"5401179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400049","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5401179","articleId":"5401276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5401349,"authors":[{"name":"Karthick Parashar","affiliation":["INRIA/ IRISA, University of Rennes 1/ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Karthick","lastName":"Parashar","id":"37400659200"},{"name":"Romuald Rocher","affiliation":["INRIA/ IRISA, University of Rennes 1/ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Romuald","lastName":"Rocher","id":"37281692500"},{"name":"Daniel Menard","affiliation":["INRIA/ IRISA, University of Rennes 1/ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Menard","id":"37281694900"},{"name":"Olivier Sentieys","affiliation":["INRIA/ IRISA, University of Rennes 1/ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Sentieys","id":"37281694500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5542-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5541-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3928-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9667"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-6923"}],"articleNumber":"5401349","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401349","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Signal processing","Analytical models","Signal processing algorithms","Cost function","Noise level","Computational modeling","Delay","Very large scale integration","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","divide and conquer methods","optimisation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical methodology","word-length optimization","signal processing systems","floating point algorithms","divide and conquer technique","algorithmic level","single noise source model","error propagation approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wordlength Optimization","Quantization Noise","System","Fixed point arithmetic","Roundoff errors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.66","endPage":"323","startPage":"318","publicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400049/5401179/05401349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Methodology for Word-Length Optimization of Signal Processing Systems","abstract":"The problem of converting floating point algorithms to implementation friendly fixed point formats is often solved as an optimization problem where the precision is traded to gain in the implementation cost.

In this paper, the radio resource allocation for wireless relay links in OFDMA-based multi-hop cellular networks is investigated. The topology of an OFDMA-based multi-hop cellular network is described as a hierarchical tree configuration, upon which a throughput-oriented objective function is formulated and the constraints including link proportional fairness are imposed. In order to maximize throughput with a low complexity, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed to optimize allocation of subcarriers and related powers.

A routing metric taking delay and congestion factors into account has been defined and implemented, which is used to establish gradient field from nodes to sink. When an event occurs in the network area, nodes employ random linear network coding to mix packets and assign \u00bfforwarding opportunities\u00bf to downstream nodes based on routing gradients and link qualities. Consequently, an interleaving-paths mesh is constructed between the source and sink. Encoded packets are routed through the mesh and finally decoded by the sink node. Extensive simulation results indicate that CodePaths adapts to the randomness of events. It achieves high throughput and low latency and the packet delivery rate keeps upon 95%. Moreover, it minimizes the data transmission and energy consumption while guaranteeing reasonable reliability.","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2009.80","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5401172/5401465/05401532.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2009.80","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401532/","displayDocTitle":"Intra-flow Network Coding Based Multipath Routing Protocol for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135313","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401532/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra-flow Network Coding Based Multipath Routing Protocol for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Fujian, China","sourcePdf":"3935a062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069541S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5401172","isNumber":"5401465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5401172","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5401465","articleId":"5401532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5401551,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Technology Department, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405834700"},{"name":"Lichun Bao","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Lichun","lastName":"Bao","id":"37287121100"},{"name":"Max Welling","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"Welling","id":"37282059300"},{"name":"Shih-Hsien Yang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Shih-Hsien","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405308700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5469-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5468-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3935-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5401551","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Space stations","Cognitive radio","GSM","Wireless sensor networks","Radio frequency","Downlink","Mobile communication","FCC","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["base station localization","cognitive radio networks","radio spectrum","wireless communication systems","grid-search","expectation maximization methods","Gaussian mixture model","mobile measurement station"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["localization","expectation maximization (EM)","Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)","path loss model"]}],"abstract":"The radio spectrum in wireless communication systems is being allocated up quickly with ever increasing demands in wireless industries. Cognitive radio is a way of opportunistically sharing the scare spectrum among primary and secondary users of the spectrum. The key challenge in deploying cognitive radio networks is to find out the spectrum holes in the primary wireless systems in order to allow the secondary users to operate. In this paper, we present novel localization algorithms based on grid-search and EM (expectation maximization) methods under the GMM (Gaussian mixture model) to find out the positions of the base stations and identify the spatial spectrum holes for cognitive radio deployments. Under this approach, we model the problem as localizing multiple unknown radio sources using a mobile measurement station, which is different from the problem modeling of many previous localization solutions. We evaluate our localization algorithms using both simulations and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2009.66","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5401172/5401465/05401551.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2009.66","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base Station Localization in Search of Empty Spectrum Spaces in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Base Station Localization in Search of Empty Spectrum Spaces in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401551/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401551/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135325","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base Station Localization in Search of Empty Spectrum Spaces in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Fujian, China","sourcePdf":"3935a094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081402S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5401172","isNumber":"5401465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5401172","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5401465","articleId":"5401551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5401575,"authors":[{"name":"Klaus Mueller","affiliation":["Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Mueller","id":"37273119700"},{"name":"Fang Xu","affiliation":["Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37275296400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5401575","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Lattices","Computed tomography","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Object detection","Detectors","Data acquisition","Computer vision","Neoplasms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","data acquisition","grid computing","signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal sampling lattices","high-fidelity CT reconstruction","Cartesian lattice","signal processing","body centered Cartesian","3D computed tomographic reconstruction","BCC lattices","CC lattices","CT data acquisition","brain tumor detection","reconstructed object","signal fidelity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401575","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401575.pdf","startPage":"3048","endPage":"3052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal sampling lattices for high-fidelity CT reconstruction","abstract":"We show that the familiar Cartesian lattice, while convenient for signal processing and representation, is suboptimal when it comes to signal fidelity.

This, combined with FPGA's low expense and ease of use make them an ideal technology for a data acquisition system for a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. The University of Washington is producing a series of high-resolution, small-animal PET scanners that utilize FPGAs as the core of the front-end electronics. For these next generation scanners, functions that are typically performed in dedicated circuits, or offline, are being migrated to the FPGA. This will not only simplify the electronics, but the features of modern FPGAs can be utilizes to add significant signal processing power to produce higher resolution images. In this paper we report how we utilize the reconfigurable property of an FPGA to self-calibrate itself to determine pulse parameters necessary for some of the pulse processing steps. Specifically, we show how the FPGA can generate a reference pulse based on actual pulse data instead of a model. We also report how other properties of the photodetector pulse (baseline, pulse length, average pulse energy and event triggers) can be determined automatically by the FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401602","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401602.pdf","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based pulse parameter discovery for positron emission tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401602/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based pulse parameter discovery for positron emission tomography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119397","pubMedId":"20607103","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401602/","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based pulse parameter discovery for positron emission tomography","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M06001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046091S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5401628,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Each of these DAQ cards has 8-channel 14-bit 100 MHz simultaneous ADCs, a six million-gate FPGA with 104 MHz onboard clock and a 16-bit 128 MB SDRAM. The SDRAM has a data transfer bandwidth of 450 MB/S, thus for raw data acquisition, only two channel ADCs can be simultaneously used at sampling rate of 100 MHz (for 8 channel simultaneous acquisition, the maximum sampling rate is about 28 MHz). In this study, data packages containing pulse arrival time, baseline, energy and position were saved instead of raw data of whole gamma signal pulse to reduce the amount of output data. Parallel signal processing containing arrival time detection, baseline calculation, pulse energy calculation and channel ID generation were implemented by model-based design method to achieve high performance PET signal processing. Finally, data packaging and down sampling approaches were employed to achieve 8-channel simultaneous signal acquisition at 100 MHz sampling rate without exceeding the SDRAM data transfer bandwidth. To examine the functionality of the signal acquisition method, PET images were obtained using a pair of detectors. The PET detector is composed of a Geiger mode avalanche photodiode (GAPD) array (3 mm \u00d7 3 mm, 4\u00d74) coupled with LYSO array crystal (3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 20 mm, 4 \u00d7 4). By rotating a pair of PET detectors for 180 degrees (6 degrees \u00d7 30 times) and simultaneously acquiring 8 channel (4 channels from each GAPD array) signals using one acquisition card, PET images of two F-18 line sources were successfully acquired. The energy resolution for 8-channel gamma signals was 19% and the timing resolution for the coincidence channels was 1.5 ns. The spatial resolution for the acquired PET image was 3.1 mm. Finally, a brain PET system using three DAQ cards has been developed and high quality PET images were acquired.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401628","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401628.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","startPage":"2870","endPage":"2872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FPGA-based high speed multi-channel simultaneous signal acquisition method for PET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A FPGA-based high speed multi-channel simultaneous signal acquisition method for PET","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401628/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119414","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5401628/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A FPGA-based high speed multi-channel simultaneous signal acquisition method for PET","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M05334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053702S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5401684,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of three motion compensation methods, event-by-event motion compensation with list-mode reconstruction (MOLAR), frame-based motion correction, and post-reconstruction image registration. Motion compensated image reconstructions were carried out with simulated HRRT data, using a range of motion information based on human motion data. ROI analyses in high contrast regions were performed to evaluate the accuracy of all the motion compensation methods, with particular attention to within-frame motion. Our study showed that MOLAR with list-mode based motion correction using accurate motion data can reliably correct for all reasonable head motions. Over all motions, the average ROI count was within 0.1\u00b14.2% and 0.7\u00b10.9% of the reference, no-motion value for two different ROIs. The location of the ROI centroid was found to be within 0.7\u00b10.3mm of that of the reference image for the raphe nucleus. Frame-based motion compensation and post-reconstruction image registration were able to correct for small (<5mm), but the ROI intensity begins to deteriorate for medium motions (5-10mm), especially for small brain structures such as the raphe nucleus. For large (>10mm) motions, the average centroid locations of the raphe nucleus ROI had an offset error of 1.5\u00b11.8mm and 1.8\u00b11.8mm for each of the frame-based methods. For each frame-based method, the decrease in the average ROI intensity was 16.9\u00b14.3% and 20.2\u00b19.9% respectively for the raphe nucleus, and was 5.5\u00b12.2% and 7.4\u00b10.2% for putamen. Based on these data, we conclude that event-by-event based motion correction works accurately for all reasonable motions, whereas frame-based motion correction is accurate only when the within-frame motion is less than 10mm.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401706","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","startPage":"3199","endPage":"3202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy of head motion compensation for the HRRT: Comparison of methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy of head motion compensation for the HRRT: Comparison of methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401706/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11103199","pubMedId":"20607125","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5401706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy of head motion compensation for the HRRT: Comparison of methods","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M09161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058612S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5401709,"authors":[{"name":"Richard E.

The gantry of the HRRT PET scanner has detector-free regions. These regions between the detector blocks introduce missing parts to the acquired PET data. Without the estimation of the missing parts of the sinogram data, the methods which require full sinogram dataset give undesired results. Previously, we proposed the iterative discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain gap-filling method which gave better quantitative and visual results than the previously published gap-filling methods. The gap-filling methods published so far estimate the missing parts only on the transaxial slices while they are ignoring the information from the neighboring transaxial slices. In this study, we propose a non-iterative gap-filling method for the compensation of the HRRT PET sinogram data by using the slices in the direction of radial samples. We compared the results of this new method with the results of the improved version of the DCT domain gap-filling approach. We used 3D numerical phantom sinogram at eight different Poisson noise levels for checking the regional quantitative results. For visual assessment, we employed a [\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sup>\nC]-raclopride human brain study. After the missing parts were estimated, we applied 2D filtered backprojection which obligates full sinogram dataset. The results showed that the non-iterative interpolation by using the slices in the direction of radial samples gave similar results as the DCT domain data estimation method. Its simplicity and the short processing time over the DCT domain gap-filling method are the notable advantageous properties of this non-iterative gap-filling approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5401727/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11103202","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation for the gap-filling of the HRRT PET sinograms by using the slices in the direction of the radial samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation for the gap-filling of the HRRT PET sinograms by using the slices in the direction of the radial samples","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M09218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047635S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5401732,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The TDC has the following unique features. (1) The time recording structures of the TDC is based on the \u00bfwave union TDC\u00bf we developed in our previous work. A leading edge of the input hit launches a bit pattern, or wave union into the delay chain-register array structure which yields two usable measurements. The two measurements effectively sub-divide timing bins for each other especially the \u00bfultra-wide bins\u00bf caused by the FPGA logic array block (LAB) structure and improves measurement precision both in terms of maximum bin width and RMS resolution. A coarser measurement on input signal trailing edge is also provided for time-over-threshold (TOT) applications. (2) The TDC supports advanced timing reference distribution schemes that are superior to conventional common start/stop schemes. The TDC has 16 regular measurement channels plus two channels for timing reference. The timing reference is established with multiple measurements rather than single shot common start/stop. An advanced scheme, the mean-timing approach even eliminates needs of high quality timing distribution media. (3) The ASIC-like encapsulation of the FPGA TDC significantly shorten the learning curve for potential users while maintain certain flexibility for various applications. Necessary digital post-processing functions including semi-continuous automatic calibration, data buffer, data link jam prevention logic etc. are integrated into the firmware to provide a turn-key solution for users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA wave union TDC for time-of-flight applications","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401738","startPage":"299","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401738.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA wave union TDC for time-of-flight applications","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401738/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11103209","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA wave union TDC for time-of-flight applications","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"N13016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075391S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5401741,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Deppe","firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Deppe","id":"37391468100"},{"name":"Holger Flemming","firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Flemming","id":"37396978700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5401741","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"abstract":"The GSI Event-Driven TDC GET4 is the first prototype of a high resolution low power event-driven TDC for the CBM-time of flight detector readout.

The TDC can increase the precision on the measurement by interpolating time within the system clock cycle. A two step phase interpolation has been constructed, one based on the phase information delivered by the VIRTEX-5 Digital Clock Manager (DCM) and thus providing a fine time, a second level phase interpolation was based on carry lines thus delivering an hyper fine time measurement. We have designed and built a PCB hosting a Virtex-5 Xilinx FPGA. The board we have designed provides 7 TDC channels. The number of channels turns out to be limited by the number of input connectors inserted on the board and not on the code density on the FPGA. The range is in principle slightly longer than 1 day (127941 sec), but our tests are preliminary and have been made on intervals less than 20 \u00bfsec. In this range we have measured a resolution which is better than 55 psec for the time interval on a single channel in single and multi-hit mode.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401744","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401744.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-precision time-to-digital converter in a FPGA device","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119479","htmlLink":"/document/5401744/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-precision time-to-digital converter in a FPGA device","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"N13014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039516S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5401763,"authors":[{"name":"Stelios Angeli","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, London, UK","Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Stelios","lastName":"Angeli","id":"38180775300"},{"name":"Efstathios Stiliaris","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Efstathios","lastName":"Stiliaris","id":"37409905700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5401763","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401763","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Image reconstruction","Subspace constraints","Transmission line matrix methods","Iterative methods","Convergence","Integral equations","Cost function","Error correction","Nuclear and plasma sciences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","image reconstruction","Newton-Raphson method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerated algebraic reconstruction technique","Newton-Raphson scheme","Newton-Raphson root-finding methodology","iterative approach","quadratic deviation","cost function","matrix notation","neighborhood rays"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401763","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401763.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","startPage":"3382","endPage":"3387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accelerated Algebraic Reconstruction Technique based on the Newton-Raphson scheme","abstract":"The idea presented here is based on the Newton-Raphson root-finding methodology for localizing the minimum of a function. The proposed algorithm follows the iterative approach of the traditional Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) with the introduction of a new correction method, similar to the Newton-Raphson scheme generalized to several dimensions. The definition of the derivative in this method causes an acceleration in the convergence speed, which results to a respectable drop of the number of iterations needed to minimize the quadratic deviation. The major issue was the definition of a Cost Function and its first and second derivative, the equivalent root of which would lead to the detection of the local minimum. This Cost Function contains the squared difference of the measured and the reconstructed projections in the appropriate matrix notation and takes into account the derivatives with respect to neighborhood rays and projection angles. Apart from the formalism, the quality of the proposed reconstruction and its convergence speed with respect to the traditional ART is discussed in this work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401763/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11103223","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401763/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An accelerated Algebraic Reconstruction Technique based on the Newton-Raphson scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accelerated Algebraic Reconstruction Technique based on the Newton-Raphson scheme","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M09323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046583S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5401810,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Grazia Pia","affiliation":["I.N.F.N.

Since the conventional ray-based backprojection method is inefficient for GPU, we develop a fully voxel-based backprojection method which can maximize the performance of GPU. In this method, the cone surface is sampled by the evenly distributed rays originated from the vertex of the cone. The intersecting chord length of the ray passing through a voxel is then approximated by the normal distance from the center of the voxel to the ray. Although this approximation can cause an error in backprojection, according to our simulation results, it does not noticeably affect the reconstruction. Our experimental phantom studies with the RAMLA (row-action maximum likelihood algorithm), which is a relaxed version of the OS-EM (ordered subsets expectation maximization) algorithm, indicate that the GPU-based method is roughly 50 times faster in computation time per iteration than the CPU-based method. According to our experimental results, for an acceptable 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 image reconstructed by RAMLA with 64 subsets and 8 iterations, the CPU-based method takes about 2.3 hours, whereas the GPU-based method takes only 2.7 minutes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated statistical image reconstruction for Compton cameras","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401814","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401814.pdf","startPage":"3550","endPage":"3555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated statistical image reconstruction for Compton cameras","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401814/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119501","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated statistical image reconstruction for Compton cameras","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M13024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076831S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5401834,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407494300"},{"name":"Yuanbao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuanbao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407093400"},{"name":"Quan Yin","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37396417900"},{"name":"Shaoqun Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqun","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37318985400"},{"name":"Qingguo Xie","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qingguo","lastName":"Xie","id":"37272284800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5401834","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":226},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401834","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Positron emission tomography","Digital signal processing","Energy resolution","Solid scintillation detectors","Timing","Noise shaping","Signal resolution","Degradation","Biomedical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical signal processing","nuclear electronics","positron emission tomography","readout electronics","scintillation counters","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digitally sampling scintillation pulses","pileup processing","high count rate detectors","high sensitivity positron emission tomography","PET scanners","digital signal processing","pileup events discrimination","pileup events processing","timing resolution","energy resolution","pulse reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Positron Emission Tomography (PET)","Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","Pileup","Scintillation Pulse"]}],"abstract":"Higher count rate detectors are needed for high sensitivity positron emission tomography (PET) scanners. However, the maximum count rate of the detectors is limited due to the large pileup quantity in the high count rate situation, in which pileups are rejected conventionally. In this paper, we investigate the development of a method for digitally sampling scintillation pulses for PET. We focus on employing the digital signal processing (DSP) technology for pileup events discrimination and processing, which can discriminate pileups and singles from multi-event pulses by the number of leading edges and then reconstruct each event pulse. With the application of this method, a pileup can be divided into two or more single pulses, therefore the timing and energy of a single event can be measured independently. The preliminary results show that the coincidence count rate can be increased obviously, and the timing resolution and energy resolution can be improved distinctively, so the results by using the DSP method are encouraging.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401834","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401834.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"147","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advantages of digitally sampling scintillation pulses in pileup processing in PET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Advantages of digitally sampling scintillation pulses in pileup processing in PET","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5401834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119509","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401834/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advantages of digitally sampling scintillation pulses in pileup processing in PET","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"N07007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040587S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5401844,"authors":[{"name":"Robert S.

Then we geometrically transformed PET image according to the result of transformation parameters calculated by previous step. We developed two stages of registration algorithm. The first stage is global registration. It is consists of 4 independent steps. After selection of reference and target images different data types and ROI of images have been normalized in the preprocessing step. As a next step, target image is geometrically transformed then the similarity between two images has been measured quantitatively. The optimization step updates transformation parameters to find the best matched parameter set efficiently. In second stage that is called fine adjustment, we introduce feature based registration algorithm. The features of each image slices are extracted by independent component analysis(ICA) and the extracted feature plane is used to measure the similarity. B-spline based freeform deformation is done to form a registered image as a final step. The result of proposed algorithm shows good agreement of images that between PET/CT to CT and PET/CT to MR. We will expand the application of the algorithm to different imaging modalities.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401869","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401869.pdf","startPage":"3717","endPage":"3720","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image registration for PET/CT and CT images with particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Image registration for PET/CT and CT images with particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11103267","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5401869/","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image registration for PET/CT and CT images with particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M13180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078246S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5401878,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This iterative 3D reconstruction also needs a lot of iterations to achieve an acceptable PET reconstructed image. A preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method was previously shown to have faster convergence rate than expectation maximization (EM) type algorithms. For the microPET, images suffer from crystal penetration blurring due to small scanner radius. An exact 2D blur model is needed to achieve high resolution image. A Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method is described for reconstruction of high-resolution 3D images from the microPET Inveon small-animal scanner from Siemens. The projector pair is used as part of a factored system matrix that takes into account detector-pair response by using shift-variant sinogram blur kernels, attenuation correction, and detector efficiency corrections. The system matrix for geometric projection is based on depth dependent solid angle calculation in combination with a spatially variant detector response model. The mircoPET PCG is combined with OSEM to accelerate convergence. This reconstruction model achieves a high resolution animal image; however, it took an hour to reconstruct a frame. Therefore, we describe an ultrafast forward and back projector pair based on Symmetry and SIMD projector (SSP). The proposed method produces similar quality images when compared to those obtained with the software package from Siemens and requires order of magnitude less computation.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401878","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","startPage":"3746","endPage":"3747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401878.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Positron emission tomography","Convergence","Image resolution","Detectors","Iterative algorithms","Kernel","Attenuation","Solid modeling","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","image reconstruction","image resolution","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","medical image processing","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preconditioned conjugate gradient MAP reconstruction","fully 3D microPET","iterative 3D PET reconstruction","crystal penetration blurring","high-resolution 3D images","Inveon small-animal scanner","Siemens","detector-pair response","shift-variant sinogram blur kernel","attenuation correction","detector efficiency correction","OSEM","software package"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ultrafast Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient MAP reconstruction for fully 3-D microPET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401878/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401878/","accessionNumber":"11119522","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrafast Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient MAP reconstruction for fully 3-D microPET","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M13198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062046S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5401882,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However lowering the energy threshold compromises the spatial resolution. This paper is an update on a method to include triple coincidences in the image without significant image degradation. With the energy threshold set as low as 50 keV, the triple coincidences analyzed are the simplest inter-crystal Compton scatter scenario where one photoelectric 511-keV detection coincides with two detections whose energy sum is also 511-keV. The method uses neural networks instead of traditional Compton interaction mathematical models to compute the proper Line-of-Response (LOR) for that coincidence. The paper revisits the algorithm structure, and in particular the preprocessing steps required to simplify the data fed to the network, preprocessing which improves the LOR computation significantly. The paper then presents Monte-Carlo analysis of the method with various point and cylinder sources. The simulated scanner geometry is purposely made to encompass the very worst-case conditions seen in PET scanners today: small diameter, poor photoelectric fraction, poor 35% FWHM energy resolution. LOR identification error is around 20 to 25% and the sensitivity increase ranges from approximately 70 to 100%. Finally, images were recently obtained, with overall very good quality.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401932","startPage":"3909","endPage":"3916","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science

position estimators. The detector module comprises of a 25.5mm\u00d725.5mm\u00d710mm LYSO crystal coupled to Hamamatsu 64 channels multi-anode PMT H7546B. Comparing with classical pixelated detectors, the prominent drawbacks of neural network based detector module are lower signal to noise ratio and more complicated signal readout scheme and data processing. The former needs low noise multi-channel readout front-end electronics with high dynamic range and high resolution signal digitization; meanwhile the latter can resort to modern FPGA technology. This paper describes our design and implementation of electronics for single block crystal PET detector modules which we are building. We choose to digitize 16 readout signals compressed from the 64 PMT channels after the simulating optimization of several possible signal readout geometries. Benefiting from the capacity and the flexibility of resource allocation of modern general class of FPGA, we implement all necessary digital nuclear signal processing techniques into a FPGA. Specially, the neural network position calculation is realized also in the FPGA. The validation and performance tests show that the system functions well with 15.3M events on-line processing throughput. The modular detector prototypes based on this electronics system can be a good platform for future physical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401951","startPage":"554","endPage":"558","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401951.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronics for monolithic scintillator PET detector modules based on neural network position estimators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401951/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Electronics for monolithic scintillator PET detector modules based on neural network position estimators","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5401951/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11119560","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronics for monolithic scintillator PET detector modules based on neural network position estimators","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"N13099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090478S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5401962,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuying Wang","affiliation":["Biomedical and Multimedia Information Technology (BMIT) Research Group, School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiuying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407484800"},{"name":"Changyang Li","affiliation":["Biomedical and Multimedia Information Technology (BMIT) Research Group, School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Changyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37403930900"},{"name":"Michael Fulham","affiliation":["Department of PET and Nuclear Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia","BMIT Research Group, School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Fulham","id":"37296002300"},{"name":"Stefan Eberl","affiliation":["Department of PET and Nuclear Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia","BMIT Research Group, School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Eberl","id":"37295441700"},{"name":"Dagan Feng","affiliation":["BMIT Research Group, School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia","Center for Multimedia Signal Processing (CMSP), Department of Electronic & Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Dagan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289600600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5401962","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Computed tomography","Positron emission tomography","Shape","Information technology","Deformable models","Liver neoplasms","Electronic mail","Nuclear medicine","Hospitals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","liver","medical image processing","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PET-enhanced liver segmentation","CT images","combined PET-CT scanners","FDG uptake","adjacent organs","low-contrast CT","liver metabolism","deformable registration","temporal imaging sessions","neighboring organs","18F-fluorodeoxyglucose"]}],"abstract":"The use of functional (PET) information from PET-CT scanners to assist liver segmentation in CT data has yet to be addressed. In this work we implement PET data enhanced liver segmentation with CT. We utilize the difference in FDG uptake between the liver and adjacent organs to separate the liver from these structures, which have similar intensities in low-contrast CT. The relatively high normal FDG uptake, and hence high SUV of liver metabolism, allows an accurate estimation for liver segmentation in CT images. By deformable registration, the PET ROIs are mapped onto the CT images for the initial liver segmentation in CT. To overcome the different intensity values of CT images from different patients or over multiple temporal imaging sessions, the initial liver region in CT images is used to establish the accurate threshold criteria for CT liver segmentation. To prevent the deformable model from leaking into the adjacent tissues and structures, the feature images are computed to exclude and disconnect neighboring organs and tissues from liver. Our experimental results in 12 clinical PET-CT studies suggest that our algorithm is robust when dealing with livers of different shapes and sizes and from a range of different patients.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401962","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05401962.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","startPage":"2756","endPage":"2759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PET-enhanced liver segmentation for CT images from combined PET-CT scanners","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5401962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PET-enhanced liver segmentation for CT images from combined PET-CT scanners","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5401962/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11103285","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5401962/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PET-enhanced liver segmentation for CT images from combined PET-CT scanners","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"M05187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078263S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5401962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5402007,"authors":[{"name":"Mateusz Wedrowski","affiliation":["Pleinlaan 2, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wedrowski","id":"37396615200"},{"name":"Peter Bruyndonckx","affiliation":["Pleinlaan 2, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Bruyndonckx","id":"37268391100"},{"name":"Stefaan Tavernier","affiliation":["Pleinlaan 2, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Stefaan","lastName":"Tavernier","id":"37272198000"},{"name":"Zhi Li","affiliation":["Pleinlaan 2, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37404751400"},{"name":"Jun Dang","affiliation":["Pleinlaan 2, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Dang","id":"37391061500"},{"name":"Pedro Rato Mendes","affiliation":["CIEMAT, Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas Medioambientales y Tecnol\u00f3gicas, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro Rato","lastName":"Mendes","id":"37278702600"},{"name":"Jose Manuel Perez","affiliation":["CIEMAT, Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas Medioambientales y Tecnol\u00f3gicas, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Manuel","lastName":"Perez","id":"37307180000"},{"name":"Karl Ziemons","affiliation":["Wilhelm Johnen Strasse, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, Julich, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Ziemons","id":"37268388900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5402007","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gamma ray detection","Gamma ray detectors","Robustness","Neural networks","Positron emission tomography","Costs","Production","Spatial resolution","Temperature","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche photodiodes","biomedical equipment","gamma-ray detection","lutetium compounds","neural nets","physics computing","positron emission tomography","scintillation counters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network algorithm","gamma detection","monolithic block detector","positron emission tomography","monolithic scintillator block","PET","depth of interaction","detector dead zones","incident gamma particle entrance point","spatial resolution","Hamamatsu S8550 APD array","monolithic LSO crystal block","cerium doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate","size 20 mm","size 30 mm","LuSiO:Ce"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402007","abstract":"The monolithic scintillator block approach for gamma detection in the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) avoids estimating Depth of Interaction (DOI), reduces dead zones in detector and diminishes costs of detector production.

The event is caused by the interaction of a medium-high energy gamma ray within a scintillator crystal coupled with Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs). Two different energy ranges are considered for the incident gamma ray: 122-140 keV and 1.1 MeV. In the first one (122-140 keV), the Photoelectric Effect is dominant over the Compton Effect, while in the second one (1.1 MeV) the situation is the opposite and the Pair Production Effect may still be ignored. At low energies, it is shown that the NNs obtain results in simulations and with experimental data comparable or better than other methods, like the Centroid (CM) and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) ones, and a precision lower than 1 mm at low noise levels (for an Equivalent Noise Charge -ENC- less than 20e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</sup>\n). At high energies, the NNs maintain a good precision, even in the occurrence of Compton interactions, with a spatial resolution of approximately 2.1 mm. Finally, the possibility to obtain the second interaction point position when a Compton Scattering occurs is examined and first simulations are presented.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402011","startPage":"645","endPage":"649","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05402011.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Employing Neural Network to determine the position of interaction of medium-high energy gamma rays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Gamma rays","Noise level","Photodetectors","Cameras","Silicon","Event detection","Gamma ray detection","Gamma ray detectors","Photovoltaic effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gamma-rays","photodetectors","position sensitive particle detectors","solid scintillation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","medium-high energy gamma rays","photodetector","Anger camera","scintillator crystal","silicon drift detectors","photoelectric effect","Compton effect","pair production effect","Compton interactions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Employing Neural Network to determine the position of interaction of medium-high energy gamma rays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5402011/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105035","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Employing Neural Network to determine the position of interaction of medium-high energy gamma rays","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"N13128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080819S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5402011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5402143,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Frach","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Frach","id":"37268166000"},{"name":"Gordian Prescher","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gordian","lastName":"Prescher","id":"37398301900"},{"name":"Carsten Degenhardt","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Degenhardt","id":"38227570100"},{"name":"Rik de Gruyter","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rik","lastName":"de Gruyter","id":"37407680500"},{"name":"Anja Schmitz","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Schmitz","id":"37392349100"},{"name":"Rob Ballizany","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Ballizany","id":"37398306900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5402143","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":187,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":2303},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402143","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Photomultipliers","Detectors","Optoelectronic and photonic sensors","Temperature sensors","Avalanche photodiodes","CMOS process","Voltage","Anodes","Diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","avalanche photodiodes","CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","nuclear electronics","photomultipliers","silicon radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital silicon photomultiplier","single photon avalanche photodiode","standard CMOS process","SPAD anode","dedicated cell electronics block","active quenching circuits","recharge circuits","balanced trigger network","time-to-digital converter","CMOS logic","low power consumption"]}],"abstract":"We developed a fully digital implementation of the Silicon Photomultiplier.

This block also contains active quenching and recharge circuits as well as a one bit memory for the selective inhibit of detector cells. A balanced trigger network is used to propagate the trigger signal from all cells to the integrated time-to-digital converter (TDC). Photons are detected and counted as digital signals, thus making the sensor less susceptible to temperature variations and electronic noise.

This kind of TOT system can enable wider dynamic range and improves linearity since the threshold follows the input signal and even shorten the width of TOT pulse. We show the concept of dynamic TOT system and results with discrete circuits.

We used the nVidia GeForce 9800GTX+ and CUDA to reconstruct images. The proposed system can generate a three-dimensional image from simulated data in 70 msec. We also compared the processing time with respect to the number of LORs per subset. We are working on optimizing the CUDA code to reduce the processing time. The data for image reconstruction were obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The PET imaging probe system provides intermediately reconstructed 3-dimensional images online in order to detect small tumors or remnants of surgically removed tumors either during surgery or preoperatively. The on line image reconstruction requires high speed computation. Even multi-processor computers may not satisfy the requirement. Fortunately, currently available GPUs provide high speed computation. We are exploring a variant of one-pass list-mode OSEM in conjunction with GPU-based coding to provide real time image reconstruction. We present intermediately reconstructed images by consecutively applying a non-overlapping data window or an overlapping data window on data. The PET probe system itself consists of a segment of a conventional PET scanner and a small, high-resolution PET detector equipped with a position-tracker. Coincidence lines-of-response (LORs) are collected between the two detectors. The imaging probe's proximity to the lesions and the small size crystals in the probe contribute to high spatial resolution. The continuously updated 3D image is reprojected in real-time onto a plane whose orientation is driven by the tracking system. Based on the intermediate images and the preoperative PET scans, surgeons can survey suspicious regions in detail. If online reconstruction and display are achievable, the PET imaging probe can be viewed as a handheld, clinician-guided camera capable of seeing the distribution of the radiotracer. Note that the probe suffers from an inherent limited angle tomography problem. However, because we are interested in the FOV that is close to the PET imaging probe, the effect of limited angle tomography may not be so severe. The GPU based image reconstruction system will be integrated with a prototype PET imaging probe. While computation speed is not yet sufficient, it can be improved by using high-end GPUs and optimized CUDA code.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402312","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05402312.pdf","startPage":"4148","endPage":"4153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time image reconstruction using GPUs for a surgical PET imaging probe system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402312/","displayDocTitle":"Real time image reconstruction using GPUs for a surgical PET imaging probe system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11103294","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5402312/","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time image reconstruction using GPUs for a surgical PET imaging probe system","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"HPP013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057188S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5402312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5402322,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However computing power is still a limit for some high quality applications. Highresolution medical image processing, for example, are strongly demanding for both memory (~250 MB) and computational capabilities allowing for 3D processing in affordable time. We propose the reduction of execution time of image processing exploiting the computing power of parallel arrays of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We apply this idea to an algorithm that finds clusters of contiguous pixels above a certain programmable threshold and process them to produce measurements that characterize their shape. It is a fast general-purpose algorithm for high-throughput clustering of data \"with a two dimensional organization\". The two-dimensional problem is well processed by FPGAs since their available logic is naturally organized into a 2-dimensional array. The algorithm is designed to be implemented with FPGAs but it can also profit of cheaper custom electronics. The key feature is a very short processing time that scales linearly with the amount of data to be processed. This means that clustering can be performed in pipeline with the image acquisition, without suffering from combinatorial delays due to looping multiple times through the whole amount of data.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402322","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05402322.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","startPage":"4138","endPage":"4141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast FPGA-based clustering algorithm for real time image processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast FPGA-based clustering algorithm for real time image processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402322/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105169","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5402322/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast FPGA-based clustering algorithm for real time image processing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"HPP010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046784S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5402322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5402352,"authors":[{"name":"William Dieckmann","affiliation":["Department, NIH Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Dieckmann","id":"37398262800"},{"name":"Shanthalaxmi Thada","affiliation":["PET Department, NIH Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Shanthalaxmi","lastName":"Thada","id":"37398263200"},{"name":"W.

Parallel computing using GPUs and CUDA offers a means to accelerate MOLAR. However, forward and backprojection operations present unique challenges that must be overcome to achieve acceptable speedup. In this study we implement GPU-accelerated versions of MOLAR's forward projection, backprojection and algorithm update modules and compare their performance to CPU-only versions. During this implementation we optimized the GPU thread configurations for each of these modules separately, along with a hybrid forward-backprojection module that is used for algorithm updates. We also numerically evaluated the reconstruction results to assess the impact of floating-point to integer conversions dictated by the GPU architecture. We found forward projection to be 41 times faster than the CPU-only code, while backprojection was 20 times faster. We found the optimal thread configurations always assigned 64 threads to a thread block, but with different distributions across the nested indexing loops within each module. These results show that MOLAR's forward and backprojection modules can be adequately accelerated to make the MOLAR reconstruction package much more efficient.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402352","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05402352.pdf","startPage":"4110","endPage":"4113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategies for accelerating forward and backprojection in list-mode OSEM PET reconstruction using GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402352/","displayDocTitle":"Strategies for accelerating forward and backprojection in list-mode OSEM PET reconstruction using GPUs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105181","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5402352/","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategies for accelerating forward and backprojection in list-mode OSEM PET reconstruction using GPUs","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"HPP003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095087S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5402352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5402353,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Because of computational demands, MOLAR currently requires a computer cluster for practical use. Here we have applied GPU-acceleration via CUDA to all of the computationally intensive modules of the MOLAR package. Using an NVIDIA Tesla S1070-400 GPU system hosted by an HP xw8400 workstation, we evaluated the GPU-accelerated performance of the modules that perform boundary checking, forward and backprojection, photon scatter modeling and algorithm updates. We compared their performance to CPU-only versions of MOLAR for a range of total counts (500 k to 50 M). We found boundary checking to be up to 35 times faster using the GPU. Forward and backprojection ran 50 and 20 times faster, respectively, and scatter modeling was 200 times faster. Algorithm updates ran up to 15 times faster. The overall performance of the entire MOLAR package was approximately 40 times faster than the CPU-only code. These results show that MOLAR can be substantially accelerated using GPUs and can thereby be practically extended for use in high count and higher resolution applications, and for 4D parametric reconstructions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05402353.pdf","startPage":"4114","endPage":"4119","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC)","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU-accelerated implementation of the MOLAR PET reconstruction package","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Packaging","Image reconstruction","Electromagnetic scattering","Particle scattering","Radio access networks","Clustering algorithms","Image resolution","Workstations","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","motion compensation","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-accelerated implementation","MOLAR PET reconstruction package","motion-compensation OSEM list-mode algorithm","resolution-recovery reconstruction","computer cluster","CUDA","computationally intensive modules","boundary checking","photon scatter modeling","higher resolution applications","graphics processing units"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"A GPU-accelerated implementation of the MOLAR PET reconstruction package","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5402353/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105182","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"24 Oct.-1 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU-accelerated implementation of the MOLAR PET reconstruction package","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"HPP004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044535S","chronDate":"Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384532","isNumber":"5401554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384532","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5401554","articleId":"5402353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5402365,"authors":[{"name":"Shiuh-hua Wood Chiang","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shiuh-hua","lastName":"Wood Chiang","id":"37086243490"},{"name":"Stuart Kleinfelder","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Kleinfelder","id":"37278135600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3961-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3962-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5402365","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402365","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Electron microscopy","Clocks","Delay","Throughput","Bandwidth","Prototypes","Image converters","Circuit simulation","Reflective binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS image sensors","electron microscopy","readout electronics","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron microscopy","CMOS image sensor","charged-particle imaging","EM5","A/D conversion circuits","parallel analog processing circuits","10-bit readout busses","clock distribution design","tree-like clock structure","readout shift-register clock delay","row shift-register clock delay","local buffering","ADC gray code counter delay","image acquisition","chip dimensions","power consumption","power distribution","matrix-math simulation","worst-case pixel IR voltage drop","worst-case analog output IR drop","power supply IR drop","output processing stage op-amps","open-loop gain variation","worst-case bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","active pixel sensor","clock distribution","power distribution","scaling"]}],"abstract":"The design and scaling of a 21 mm \u00d7 21 mm CMOS image sensor for charged-particle imaging, \u00bfEM7,\u00bf is presented and compared to its smaller prototype, EM5. The sensor contains ~50 million transistors spanning its 16 million pixels, and includes over 4,100 parallel analog processing and A/D conversion circuits, utilizing 12 parallel 10-bit readout busses for high data throughput. The clock distribution design in EM7 minimizes the clock delay by dividing the chip into multiple parallel sections, each driven locally by a tree-like clock structure. By this technique, simulations showed that the readout shift-register clock delay is reduced from 4.7 ns to 0.14 ns, and the row shift-register clock delay is reduced from 1.7 ns to 0.12 ns. With similar local buffering, the ADC gray code counter delay is reduced from 35 ns to 0.9 ns. These improvements allow EM7 to sustain image acquisition at 75 frames/s, for a continuous data throughput of over 10 Gb/s. The large chip dimensions and the increased power consumption in EM7 also require more robust power distribution. A matrix-math simulation shows the worst-case pixel IR voltage drop was improved from 20 mV to 8 mV. Similarly, the pixel's worst-case analog output's IR drop is reduced from 80.7 mV to 2.58 mV, and its bandwidth is thus increased from 6.92 MHz to 14.4 MHz. The power supply IR drop in the output processing stage's op-amps is reduced from 327 mV to 35 mV, their open-loop gain variation is reduced from 525% to 28%, and their worst-case bandwidth is increased from 0.87 MHz to 764 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402365","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384532/5401554/05402365.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record

The probability density function of ITI is obtained analytically and is used to estimate the bit error rate (BER) from the Viterbi detector. The proposed method takes into account most of the important factors affecting the BER such as ITI, un-equalized intersymbol interference (ISI), colored noise and the distance and the multiplicity of error events. In this work, it is shown that for 1D channels, modeling ITI and un-equalized ISI by Gaussian PDFs leads to inaccurate BERs and that the non-Gaussian distribution of the ITI and un-equalized ISI must be taken into account for more accurate BER estimates. This method provides fast and accurate estimates of BERs for moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By using this analytical method, time-consuming numerical simulations for error performance evaluation can be avoided.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100202","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5402476/05402480.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"135","endPage":"142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Approach for Performance Evaluation of Bit-Patterned Media Channels","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5402480/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11088774","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Approach for Performance Evaluation of Bit-Patterned Media Channels","sourcePdf":"135jsac0210nabavi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05667S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5402476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5402476","articleId":"5402480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5402483,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5402476/5402483/5402483-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiming Chen received the B.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007 and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from School of EECS, Washington State University, Pullman, since 2007.

However, even with increased computing power, complexities of soft-decision decoding algorithms are still too high for real products which require high throughput and small hardware area. Another problem is that the performance gains of those approaches are smaller for magnetic recording channels than they are for memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. We propose a new soft-decision decoding algorithm (based on the Chase algorithm), which takes advantage of pattern reliability instead of symbol reliability or bit reliability. We also present a modified Viterbi algorithm that provides probable error patterns with corresponding reliabilities. Simulation results of the proposed algorithms over the partial response (PR) channel show attractive performance gains. The proposed algorithm dramatically reduces the number of iterations compared to the conventional Chase2 algorithm over the PR channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern-Flipping Chase-Type Decoders with Error Pattern Extracting Viterbi Algorithm over Partial Response Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5402476/05402484.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402484/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"Pattern-Flipping Chase-Type Decoders with Error Pattern Extracting Viterbi Algorithm over Partial Response Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5402484/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11088777","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern-Flipping Chase-Type Decoders with Error Pattern Extracting Viterbi Algorithm over Partial Response Channels","sourcePdf":"181jsac0210lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075362S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5402476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5402476","articleId":"5402484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5402485,"authors":[{"name":"Kees A.

We first propose simple and efficient finitestate encoding methods to design various distance-enhancing constrained codes, including a repeated minimum transition runlength (RMTR) code for optical recording channels, as well as a maximum transition run (MTR) code for magnetic recording channels. We further propose a general and systematic code design methodology, which can efficiently combine constrained codes with PC codes. The constrained codes can be any distanceenhancing constrained codes. The PC codes can be any linear binary PC codes. The rates of the designed codes are only a few tenths of a percent below the theoretical maximum. The proposed method enables soft information to be available to the PC decoder and soft decoding of PC codes. Examples of several newly designed distance-enhancing constrained PC codes are illustrated.

For the size of the syndrome table to be manageable and the list of possible error events to be reasonable in size, the codeword length of EPCC needs to be short enough. However, the rate of such a short length code will be too low for hard drive applications. To accommodate the required large redundancy, it is possible to record only a highly compressed function of the parity bits of EPCC's tensor product with a symbol correcting code. In this paper, we show that the proposed tensor error-pattern correcting code (T-EPCC) is linear time encodable and also devise a low-complexity soft iterative decoding algorithm for EPCC's tensor product with q-ary LDPC (T-EPCC-qLDPC). Simulation results show that T-EPCC-qLDPC achieves almost similar performance to single-level qLDPC with a 1/2 KB sector at 50% reduction in decoding complexity. Moreover, 1 KB T-EPCC-qLDPC surpasses the performance of 1/2 KB single-level qLDPC at the same decoder complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","volume":"28","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11104776","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5402490/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Iteratively Decodable Tensor Product Code with Application to Data Storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iteratively Decodable Tensor Product Code with Application to Data Storage","sourcePdf":"228jsac0210alhussien.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135561S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5402476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5402476","articleId":"5402490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5402492,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5402476/5402492/5402492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Han received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\u2019 University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ in 2004 and 2008 respectively.

Error floors are known to generally be caused by so-called trapping sets which have the effect of confounding the decoder. In this paper, we introduce two techniques that lower the error-rate floors for LDPC-coded partial response (PR) channels which are applicable to magnetic and optical storage. The techniques involve, via external measures, \"pinning\" one of the bits in each problematic trapping set and then letting the iterative decoder proceed to correct the rest of the bits. We also extend our earlier work on generalized-LDPC (G-LDPC) decoders for error-floor mitigation on the AWGN channel to partial response channels. Our simulations on PR1 and EPR4 channels demonstrate that the floor for the code chosen for this study, a 0.78(2048,1600) quasicyclic LDPC code, is lowered by orders of magnitude, beyond the reach of simulations. Because simulation in the floor region is so time-consuming, a method for accelerating such simulations is essential for research in this area. In this paper, we present an extension of Richardson's importance sampling technique for estimating the level of error floors.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5402476/05402492.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Floor Detection/Decoding of LDPC-Coded Partial Response Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-Floor Detection/Decoding of LDPC-Coded Partial Response Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402492/","publicationDate":"February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11088780","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5402492/","volume":"28","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Floor Detection/Decoding of LDPC-Coded Partial Response Channels","sourcePdf":"252jsac0210han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095512S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5402476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5402476","articleId":"5402492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5402494,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchong Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Key Laboratory on High Performance Computing, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5402476/5402494/5402494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["YuChong Hu received the B.S. from the School for the Gifted Young, University of Science & Technology of China, Anhui, China, in 2005.

We design a mutually cooperative recovery (MCR) mechanism for multiple node failures. Via a cut-based analysis of the information flow graph, we obtain a lower bound of maintenance bandwidth based on MCR. For MCR, we also propose a transmission scheme and design a linear network coding scheme based on (\u00bf, \u00bf) strong-MDS code, which is a generalization of (\u00bf, \u00bf) MDS code. We prove that the maintenance bandwidth based on our transmission and coding schemes matches the lower bound, so the lower bound is tight and the transmission scheme and coding scheme for MCR are optimal. We also give numerical comparisons of MCR with other redundancy recovery mechanisms in storage cost and maintenance bandwidth to show the advantage of MCR.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5402476/05402494.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Recovery of Distributed Storage Systems from Multiple Losses with Network Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Bandwidth","Costs","Telecommunication traffic","Information analysis","Flow graphs","Distributed computing","Availability","Computer science","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","network coding","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative recovery","distributed storage systems","mutually cooperative recovery mechanism","multiple node failures","cut-based analysis","information flow graph","maintenance bandwidth","low bound","linear network coding scheme","strong-MDS code","redundancy recovery mechanisms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding, Distributed storage system, Erasure coding, Multiple loss recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Recovery of Distributed Storage Systems from Multiple Losses with Network Coding","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5402494/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11088781","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Recovery of Distributed Storage Systems from Multiple Losses with Network Coding","sourcePdf":"268jsac0210hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096211S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5402476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5402476","articleId":"5402494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5402561,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Biggs","affiliation":["Information Operations Research Group, University of Wales, Newport, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Biggs","id":"37411892400"},{"name":"Stilianos Vidalis","affiliation":["Information Operations Research Group, University of Wales, Newport, UK"],"firstName":"Stilianos","lastName":"Vidalis","id":"37395060500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5648-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5647-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-9546628-2-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5402561","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Digital forensics","Guidelines","Costs","Computer crime","Operations research","Companies","Frequency","Capacitive sensors","Law enforcement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","computer forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","digital forensic investigations","business viability","business sustainability","CC business model","SME","CLOIDIFIN project"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing (CC) as a concept and business opportunity is likely to see many organisations experiencing the 'credit crunch', embrace the relatively low cost option of CC to ensure continued business viability and sustainability.

Private end users will also look to utilise the colossal pool of resources that CC offers in an attempt to provide mobile freedom of information. However, as with many opportunities that offer legitimate users enormous benefits, unscrupulous and criminal users will also look to use CC to exploit the loopholes that may exist within this new concept, design and business model.

In this article we review the requirements for next-generation HANs and show that this environment may end up taking advantage of optical cabling solutions as an alternative to more traditional copper or pure wireless approaches.","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5402648/05402662.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"47","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402662","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402662","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402662","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Next generation networking","Home automation","Optical fiber networks","High speed optical techniques","Delay","Optical fibers","Passive optical networks","Bit rate","Spine","Optical fiber cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","digital subscriber lines","home computing","local area networks","optical cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next-generation home area network","broadband connection","fiber to the home technology","ADSL technology","optical cabling solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Perspective in next-generation home networks: Toward optical solutions?","accessionNumber":"11088695","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5402662/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perspective in next-generation home networks: Toward optical solutions?","sourcePdf":"014MOLLERSLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060189S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5402648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5402648","articleId":"5402662","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5402664,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajia Chen","affiliation":["Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Jiajia Chen (jiajiac@kth.se) received a B.S. degree in information engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004, and a Ph.D. degree from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, in 2009.

Several fiber access network architectures have been developed (e.g., point-to-point, active optical network, and passive optical network). PON is considered the most promising solution due to the relatively low deployment cost and high resource efficiency. Meanwhile, because of the growing demand for reliable service delivery, fault management is becoming more significant in all parts of communications networks. However, there is a trade-off between the cost of protection and the level of service reliability. Since economical aspects are most critical in the access part of networks, improving reliability performance by duplication of network resources (and capital expenditures) could be too expensive. Therefore, recent work has focused on PON protection schemes with reduced CAPEX. The future trend will probably migrate toward minimizing operational expenditures during the access network lifetime. The main contributions of this article include providing a general method for CAPEX and OPEX analysis that can be applied to any type of fiber access network with consideration of changed component cost in time and variable take rates, and comparing the total cost (i.e., sum of CAPEX and OPEX) for the selected representative architectures with and without protection for business and residential users in relation to reliability performance. The aim is to give a guideline for the design of the most cost-effective protection schemes, while maintaining acceptable service reliability.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5402648/05402664.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost vs. reliability performance study of fiber access network architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402664/","displayDocTitle":"Cost vs. reliability performance study of fiber access network architectures","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11104754","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5402664/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost vs. reliability performance study of fiber access network architectures","sourcePdf":"016CHENLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063472S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5402648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5402648","articleId":"5402664","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5402665,"authors":[{"name":"Sunan Han","affiliation":["Fujitsu Network Communications, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"p":["(Sunan Han (sunanhan@gmail.com) graduated from Beijing University with a B.S. and Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics with an M.S., both in computer engineering.

Some technical challenges for implementing CA technique in LTE-Advanced systems, with the requirements of backward compatibility to LTE systems, are highlighted and discussed. Possible technical solutions for the asymmetric CA problem, control signaling design, handover control, and guard band setting are reviewed. Simulation results show Doppler frequency shift has only limited impact on data transmission performance over wide frequency bands in a high-speed mobile environment when the component carriers are time synchronized. The frequency aliasing will generate much more interference between adjacent component carriers and therefore greatly degrades the bit error rate performance of downlink data transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5402648/05402669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402648","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier aggregation for LTE-advanced mobile communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Carrier aggregation for LTE-advanced mobile communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11088698","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5402669/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier aggregation for LTE-advanced mobile communication systems","sourcePdf":"021YANGLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042393S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5402648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"5402648","articleId":"5402669","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5402670,"authors":[{"name":"Honglin Hu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"bio":{"p":["Honglin Hu [M] (hlhu@ieee.org) received his Ph.D. degree in communications and information systems in January 2004, from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

In LTE, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access is adopted in the downlink of its E-UTRA air interface. Although cross-layer techniques have been widely adopted in literature for dynamic resource allocation to maximize data rate in OFDMA wireless networks, application-oriented quality of service for video delivery, such as delay constraint and video distortion, have been largely ignored. However, for wireless video delivery in LTE, especially delay-bounded real-time video streaming, higher data rate could lead to higher packet loss rate, thus degrading the user-perceived video quality. In this article we present a new QoS-aware LTE OFDMA scheduling algorithm for wireless real-time video delivery over the downlink of LTE cellular networks to achieve the best user-perceived video quality under the given application delay constraint. In the proposed approach, system throughput, application QoS constraints, and scheduling fairness are jointly integrated into a cross-layer design framework to dynamically perform radio resource allocation for multiple users, and to effectively choose the optimal system parameters such as modulation and coding scheme and video encoding parameters to adapt to the varying channel quality of each resource block. Experimental results have shown significant performance enhancement of the proposed system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5402648/05402671.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5402671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-driven cross-layer optimized video delivery over LTE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Resource management","Quality of service","Long Term Evolution","Mobile communication","Next generation networking","Broadband communication","Wireless networks","Delay","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","cellular radio","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation","scheduling","video coding","video streaming","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality-driven cross-layer optimized video delivery","3GPP long term evolution","mobile communication","next-generation mobile broadband network","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","E-UTRA air interface","application-oriented quality of service","delay constraint","video distortion","delay-bounded real-time video streaming","packet loss rate","video quality","QoS-aware LTE OFDMA scheduling","wireless real-time video delivery","cellular network","system throughput","QoS constraint","scheduling fairness","radio resource allocation","modulation","video encoding","channel quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Quality-driven cross-layer optimized video delivery over LTE","volume":"48","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5402671/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11088700","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-driven cross-layer optimized video delivery over LTE","sourcePdf":"023CILAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05691S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5402648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5402648","articleId":"5402671","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5402673,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Stallman","affiliation":["Free Software Foundation, Inc., India"],"bio":{"p":["Richard Stallman (rms@gnu.org) launched the Free Software Movement in 1983 and began development of the GNU operating system (see www.gnu.org) in 1984.

We present the design concept and highlight some experimental results obtained from performance evaluation of the RoFSO system we have developed. Using the quality metric parameters defined for the different RF service signals transmitted over the experimental RoFSO system, the results demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of reliability and stability.

Then the reasons for the prematurity and the stagnation of the standard QGA are analyzed from the perspective of network structure. To solve the two problems, an improved quantum genetic algorithm (IQGA) based on the small world theory is proposed. In IQGA, chromosomes encoded with qubits are divided into some sub-groups and the NW network model is introduced into the population structure. When updating chromosomes, an optimal chromosome in locality or in other sub-groups is chosen based on a certain probability as the evolution target for each chromosome. The new network structure of the chromosome population has a relatively moderate clustering coefficient and is favorable to the diversity of individual chromosomes. Tests of three classic functions prove the effectiveness and superiority of IQGA.","doi":"10.1109/WGEC.2009.41","pdfPath":"/iel5/5402741/5402743/05402959.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WGEC.2009.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11106344","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5402959/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"3899a014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0509S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5402741","isNumber":"5402743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5402741","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5402743","articleId":"5402959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5402984,"authors":[{"name":"Luo-feng Geng","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technology, China","Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technolgoy"],"firstName":"Luo-feng","lastName":"Geng","id":"37661451000"},{"name":"Duo-li Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technology, China","Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technolgoy"],"firstName":"Duo-li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279217000"},{"name":"Ming-Lun Gao","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technology, China","Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technolgoy"],"firstName":"Ming-Lun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37274310500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4995-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1520"}],"articleNumber":"5402984","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Cluster-Based Homogeneous Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Using FPGA Device","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402984","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiprocessing systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Network-on-a-chip","Prototypes","Hardware","Software performance","Application software","Software prototyping","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","interconnections","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluster-based homogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chip","FPGA device","NoC architecture","bus-based architecture","hybrid interconnection","MPSoC architecture","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"The cluster-based multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), which adopts the hybrid interconnection composed of both bus-based and NoC architecture, is a new infrastructure for MPSoC.

Different mapping heuristics are developed for these templates: tightly coupled vertices are mapped onto tiles that are close to each other while the distributed vertices are mapped following a graph partition scheme. The proposed template-based mapping algorithm achieves on average 15% power saving compared with MOCA, a fast greedy-based algorithm.

However, without fixed hardware architecture, the FPGA-based computing system is mostly a mixture of hardware and software. This kind of system is difficult to design because hardware and software are developed using quite different models of computation. To handle this problem, a FPGA-based platform supporting Java programming language is proposed in this paper. This platform has two aspects: 1) to find the applications amenable to very large speedup using FPGA-based systems, such as computer vision, image processing, microarray analysis and so on. 2) To provide a three level solution making the hardware transparent to application programmers. This platform is expected to provide an effective way to accelerate FPGA-based custom computing to be used in embedded systems.","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Embedded and Multimedia Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Embedded and Multimedia Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5402739/5402962/05402993.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use Object-Oriented Platform to Facilitate FPGA-Based Computing in Embedded Systems","doi":"10.1109/EM-COM.2009.5402993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EM-COM.2009.5402993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5402993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Use Object-Oriented Platform to Facilitate FPGA-Based Computing in Embedded Systems","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106674","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5402993/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use Object-Oriented Platform to Facilitate FPGA-Based Computing in Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048803S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5402739","isNumber":"5402962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5402739","xplore-issue":"5402962","articleId":"5402993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5402995,"authors":[{"name":"Jih-Sheng Shen","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jih-Sheng","lastName":"Shen","id":"37405338900"},{"name":"Chun-Hsian Huang","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hsian","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293541100"},{"name":"Pao-Ann Hsiung","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pao-Ann","lastName":"Hsiung","id":"37277259000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4995-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1520"}],"articleNumber":"5402995","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Network-on-a-chip","Energy consumption","Interference","Crosstalk","Wires","Hardware","Runtime environment","Field programmable gate arrays","Communication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","encoding","field programmable gate arrays","interference","network-on-chip","power aware computing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PRESSNoC","reconfigurable network-on-chip architecture","power-aware encoding schemes","reliable encoding schemes","reasoning and learning framework","Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA device","full-fledged encoding method","interference rate per instruction","crosstalk interferences","dynamic power consumption"]}],"abstract":"We propose a Power-aware and Reliable Encoding Schemes Supported reconfigurable Network-on-Chip (PRESSNoC) architecture whereby an encoding can be selected by a REasoning And Learning (REAL) framework at run-time to fit the reliability and power requirements of the application and its execution environment.

The average benefit to overhead ratio of the proposed architecture is greater than that of the traditional architecture by 71%, 32%, and 277% when we consider the individual effects of interference rate per instruction, application domains, and system characteristics, respectively.

In recent years, Model driven architecture or engineering methodology has been introduced in the field of software engineering by OMG. This methodology separate platform independent, and platform specific concerns, and could be utilized and extended to other fields of engineering. In many industrial applications, embedded, distributed and fast sensory data fusion operators are necessary, and system complexities could be dominated by low level dedicated fast fusion operators on real time hardware platforms such as CPLDs and FPGAs. In this experience, embedded data fusion toolbox has been developed for fast design, prototyping, test and implementation of simple fusion operators on embedded industrial platforms. This toolbox has been implemented in MATLAB/Simulink environment via behavioral arithmetic to the implementation on either FPGA. Reusability, scalability, chip area, precision and other design criteria are considered in design process, and desired HDL models could be obtained automatically. This fully automated toolbox is extendible for complex data fusion operators, subsequently the platform-independent model can be translated to a platform-specific model (PSM) by mapping the PIM to some implementation language or platform using formal rules in order to preparing targeted models in different platforms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5402962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EM-COM.2009.5402999","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Embedded and Multimedia Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Embedded and Multimedia Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5402739/5402962/05402999.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/EM-COM.2009.5402999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded Data Fusion Toolbox: A Model Driven Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Embedded Data Fusion Toolbox: A Model Driven Architecture","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5402999/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106680","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5402999/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded Data Fusion Toolbox: A Model Driven Architecture","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066919S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5402739","isNumber":"5402962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5402739","xplore-issue":"5402962","articleId":"5402999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5403002,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Arbab Jolfaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh Arbab","lastName":"Jolfaei","id":"37393841200"},{"name":"Neda Mohammadizadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Neda","lastName":"Mohammadizadeh","id":"37393810200"},{"name":"Mohammad Sadegh Sadri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Sadegh","lastName":"Sadri","id":"37393812400"},{"name":"Fatemeh FaniSani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"FaniSani","id":"37393812200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4995-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1520"}],"articleNumber":"5403002","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Universal Serial Bus","Field programmable gate arrays","Embedded system","Joining processes","Automatic control","Microprocessors","Microcontrollers","System-on-a-chip","Logic design","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","peripheral interfaces","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed USB 2.0 interface","FPGA based embedded systems","high speed serial peripherals","Cypress SX2 USB 2.0 controller","simple interface module","large system-on-chip designs","Xilinx embedded design flow","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"FPGA implementation of high speed serial peripherals such as USB 2.0 are of great use.

Xilinx complete set of development tools make implementation of large system-on-chip designs feasible. We present two complete architectures for connecting SX2 to FPGA. First design minimizes FPGA resource usage while keeping a reasonable speed. In the second design, optimizations are done to reach maximum USB 2.0 interface speed at the cost of some additional logic.

Information describing the printable strings contained in each sample was input to various classification algorithms, including tree-based classifiers, a nearest neighbour algorithm, statistical algorithms and AdaBoost. Using k-fold cross validation on the unpacked malware and clean files, we achieved a classification accuracy of 97%. Our results reveal that strings from library code (rather than malicious code itself) can be utilised to distinguish different malware families.","doi":"10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403021","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5392747/5403012/05403021.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automated classification system based on the strings of trojan and virus families","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403021/","displayDocTitle":"An automated classification system based on the strings of trojan and virus families","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106520","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403021/","conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automated classification system based on the strings of trojan and virus families","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"rp0051569229588.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102264S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5392747","isNumber":"5403012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5392747","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5403012","articleId":"5403021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5403030,"authors":[{"name":"Rachid Belaroussi","affiliation":["LEPSIS INRETS LCPC, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Belaroussi","id":"37393852100"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Tarel","affiliation":["LEPSIS INRETS LCPC, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Tarel","id":"37326337400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5498-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5497-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5496-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5790"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-5790"}],"articleNumber":"5403030","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403030","abstract":"We present a new transformation for angle vertex and bisector detection.

The method utilizes the strain impacted on the facial skin due to the non-rigid motion caused during expressions. The strain magnitude is calculated using the central difference method over the robust and dense optical flow field of each subjects face. Testing has been done on 2 datasets (which includes 100 macro-expressions) and promising results have been obtained. The method is robust to several common drawbacks found in automatic facial expression segmentation including moderate in-plane and out-of-plane motion. Additionally, the method has also been modified to work with videos containing micro-expressions. Micro-expressions are detected utilizing their smaller spatial and temporal extent. A subject's face is divided in to sub-regions (mouth, cheeks, forehead, and eyes) and facial strain is calculated for each of these regions. Strain patterns in individual regions are used to identify subtle changes which facilitate the detection of micro-expressions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398686/5403027/05403044.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)","doi":"10.1109/WACV.2009.5403044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WACV.2009.5403044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards macro- and micro-expression spotting in video using strain patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitive sensors","Biomedical optical imaging","Face recognition","Nonlinear optics","Robustness","Image motion analysis","Face detection","Strain measurement","Facial animation","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micro-expression spotting","macro-expression spotting","temporal segmentation","strain patterns","automatic spotting","optical flow field","automatic facial expression segmentation","facial strain","in-plane plane motion","out-of plane motion","micro-expressions detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Towards macro- and micro-expression spotting in video using strain patterns","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403044/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106603","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards macro- and micro-expression spotting in video using strain patterns","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112513S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398686","isNumber":"5403027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398686","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5403027","articleId":"5403044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5403051,"authors":[{"name":"Protik Maitra","affiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Protik","lastName":"Maitra","id":"37393667100"},{"name":"Stan Schneider","affiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37399195000"},{"name":"Min C.

Manual labeling of bees over many frames is painstaking and time-consuming. Automated tracking is challenging because of the appearance change and unreliable features. This problem is magnified when tracking for a longer period of time is required. We present a method for tracking bees that minimizes the accumulation of error over time by using (1) static and adaptive appearance templates for handling appearance change, and (2) geometry-constrained resampling of particles for handling unreliable features. Evaluation against manually-labeled ground truth demonstrates that our method tracks bees with an RMSE of 8.7 pixels (typical bee length is >100 pixels), and 75% position and 58% angular error improvement over a particle filtering based tracking with Gaussian modeling of appearance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5403051/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136433","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust bee tracking with adaptive appearance template and geometry-constrained resampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust bee tracking with adaptive appearance template and geometry-constrained resampling","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040618S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398686","isNumber":"5403027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398686","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5403027","articleId":"5403051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5403087,"authors":[{"name":"Manika Puri","affiliation":["Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Manika","lastName":"Puri","id":"37408005100"},{"name":"Zhiwei Zhu","affiliation":["Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Zhiwei Zhu","id":"37281373500"},{"name":"Qian Yu","affiliation":["Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Yu","id":"37404596500"},{"name":"Ajay Divakaran","affiliation":["Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Divakaran","id":"37300297000"},{"name":"Harpreet Sawhney","affiliation":["Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Harpreet","lastName":"Sawhney","id":"37269465000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5498-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5497-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5496-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5790"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-5790"}],"articleNumber":"5403087","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1253},"abstract":"We present a system that improves accuracy of food intake assessment using computer vision techniques. Traditional dietetic method suffers from the drawback of either inaccurate assessment or complex lab measurement. Our solution is to use a mobile phone to capture images of foods, recognize food types, estimate their respective volumes and finally return quantitative nutrition information. Automated and accurate food recognition presents the following challenges. First, there exist a large variety of food types that people consume in everyday life. Second, a single category of food may contain large variations due to different ways of preparation. Also, diverse lighting conditions may lead to varying visual appearance of foods. All of these pose a challenge to the state of the art recognition approaches. Moreover, the low quality images captured using cellphones make the task of 3D reconstruction difficult. In this paper, we combine several vision techniques (visual recognition and 3D reconstruction) to achieve quantitative food intake estimation. Evaluation of both recognition and reconstruction is provided in the experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398686/5403027/05403087.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)","doi":"10.1109/WACV.2009.5403087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WACV.2009.5403087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition and volume estimation of food intake using a mobile device","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular phones","Image reconstruction","Cameras","Speech recognition","Image databases","Image segmentation","Mobile computing","Computer vision","Mobile handsets","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","image reconstruction","medical image processing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["food intake recognition","food intake volume estimation","mobile device","visual recognition","3D reconstruction","dietetic method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Recognition and volume estimation of food intake using a mobile device","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403087/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106579","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition and volume estimation of food intake using a mobile device","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057523S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398686","isNumber":"5403027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398686","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5403027","articleId":"5403087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5403092,"authors":[{"name":"Soon-Yong Park","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soon-Yong","lastName":"Park","id":"37406935200"},{"name":"Sung-In Choi","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-In","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405755800"},{"name":"Jaekyoung Moon","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaekyoung","lastName":"Moon","id":"37402480000"},{"name":"Joon Kim","affiliation":["Agency for Defence Development, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37407275000"},{"name":"Yong Woon Park","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong Woon","lastName":"Park","id":"37407407600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5498-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5497-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5496-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5790"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-5790"}],"articleNumber":"5403092","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Central Processing Unit","Image reconstruction","Laser modes","Shape","Iterative algorithms","Iterative closest point algorithm","Computer vision","Cameras","Real time systems","Moon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","computer vision","image registration","microprocessor chips","parallel architectures","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time 3D registration","computer vision","multiview range images","reference coordinate system","accelerated computing power","graphic processing unit","point-to-plane 3D registration","CUDA programming","GPU programming","hand-held stereo vision sensor"]}],"abstract":"3D registration is a computer vision technique of aligning multi-view range images with respect to a reference co-ordinate system.

The granularity of this data, as well as new players' entry into the energy market, creates new privacy concerns. The detailed per-household consumption data that advanced metering systems generate reveals information about in-home activities that such players can mine and combine with other readily available information to discover more about occupants' activities. The authors explore the technological aspects of this claim, focusing on the ways in which personally identifying information can be collected and repurposed. Their results show that, even with relatively unsophisticated hardware and data-extraction algorithms, some information about occupant behavior can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy. The authors propose a disclosure metric to aid in quantifying the impact of data collection on in-home privacy and construct an example metric for their experiment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2010.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403138","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Security & Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel5/8013/5403138/05403146.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inferring Personal Information from Demand-Response Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403146/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Inferring Personal Information from Demand-Response Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11118271","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inferring Personal Information from Demand-Response Systems","sourcePdf":"msp2010010011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05038S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8013","isNumber":"5403138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8013","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"5403138","articleId":"5403146","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5403159,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu Khurana","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Himanshu Khurana is a principal research scientist at the Information Trust Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

To effectively reduce access times and resource consumption for on-chip RAM, an efficient buffer design is presented in prediction mode selection and reference pixel access. Based on the similarities of intra prediction for different modes, a reconfigurable computational module is designed to adapt to the 26 prediction modes in H.264/AVC so as to reduce chip area. To speed up intra prediction and make reconstruction more convenient, pre-processing for Plane mode and eight parallel processors are adopted in the proposed architecture. The proposed architecture is implemented by SMIC 0.18 um technology with about 55 K gate counts at 165 MHz.

However, the use of three lists causes a high, variable and data dependant memory requirement, therefore the original SPIHT dose not suit for hardware implementation. In this paper, a Modified SPIHT (MSPIHT) method suitable for image compression's hardware implementation is proposed. Through using two state mark bitmaps to replace three lists of SPIHT, MSPIHT saves memory space and avoids memory dynamic management. Furthermore according to using an array to store the maximum value of zerotree set's coefficients as well as merging the sorting pass and refinement pass as one scan, MSPIHT also enhances the algorithm's iteration efficiency. Experimental results show that this MSPIHT quantization method is simple, efficient, resource saving, and is suitable for real time and low memory implementation.","doi":"10.1109/WCSE.2009.878","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5402742/5403164/05403201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSE.2009.878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403164","startPage":"572","endPage":"576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified SPIHT Based Image Compression Algorithm for Hardware Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified SPIHT Based Image Compression Algorithm for Hardware Implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403201/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106353","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403201/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified SPIHT Based Image Compression Algorithm for Hardware Implementation","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"3881b572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070572S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5402742","isNumber":"5403164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5402742","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5403164","articleId":"5403201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5403225,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Chunyu","affiliation":["State key laboratory of fire science of USTC, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Chunyu","id":"37393549500"},{"name":"Zhang Yongming","affiliation":["State key laboratory of fire science of USTC, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yongming","id":"37393546400"},{"name":"Fang Jun","affiliation":["State key laboratory of fire science of USTC, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Jun","id":"37409157700"},{"name":"Wang Jinjun","affiliation":["State key laboratory of fire science of USTC, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Jinjun","id":"37393539300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5285-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3881-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5403225","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fires","Smoke detectors","Image texture analysis","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Image edge detection","Motion detection","Shape measurement","Computer science","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fires","image texture","matrix algebra","neural nets","real-time systems","smoke","smoke detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture analysis","real-time fire detection","real-time fire smoke detection","gray level cooccurrence matrices","block processing","neural network","smoke texture features","fire alarm trigger"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video fire smoke detection","texture","image processing","real-time detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403225","abstract":"Since the texture is an important feature of smoke, a novel method of texture analysis is proposed for real-time fire smoke detection.

The analysis depends on modeling attack activities and attack processes by tracking the transferring of safety states. Three key factors of risk evaluation about assets, threats and vulnerabilities are identified and quantified. Especially the attack probability indexes are recurrently estimated by layering based on the intruding process, and accurate success probabilities of attack are obtained. Then a quantitative evaluation algorithm is presented to estimate risk indexes by layering based on the intruding process. The conclusion obtained by this approach provides a useful evidence and guidance for security strategies.

Based on daily load data of one electric power plant, this model can obtained more accurate prediction results.","doi":"10.1109/WCSE.2009.695","pdfPath":"/iel5/5402742/5403230/05403357.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"397","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSE.2009.695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Load Prediction Based on Ant Colony Clustering-Elman Neural Network Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Prediction Based on Ant Colony Clustering-Elman Neural Network Model","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11106458","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5403357/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Prediction Based on Ant Colony Clustering-Elman Neural Network Model","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"3881a394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054044S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5402742","isNumber":"5403230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5402742","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5403230","articleId":"5403357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5403368,"authors":[{"name":"Shengguo Hu","affiliation":["Etsong Tobacco (Group) Limited, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Shengguo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37402054100"},{"name":"Yanfeng Liang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yanfeng","lastName":"Liang","id":"37401142800"},{"name":"Lintao Ma","affiliation":["The Center of Information Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Lintao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37291473800"},{"name":"Ying He","affiliation":["The Center of Information Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"He","id":"37065438200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5285-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3881-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5403368","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1026},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403368","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Boosting","Sampling methods","Data engineering","Oceans","Accuracy","Machine learning algorithms","Classification algorithms","Intrusion detection","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ada","data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSMOTE","modified synthetic minority over-sampling technique","classification performance","learning","biased classifiers","AdaBoost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imbalanced data","over-sampling","SMOTE","AdaBoost","samples groups","SMOTEBoost"]}],"abstract":"Learning from data sets that contain very few instances of the minority class usually produces biased classifiers that have a higher predictive accuracy over the majority class, but poorer predictive accuracy over the minority class. SMOTE (synthetic minority over-sampling technique) is specifically designed for learning from imbalanced data sets. This paper presents a modified approach (MSMOTE) for learning from imbalanced data sets, based on the SMOTE algorithm. MSMOTE not only considers the distribution of minority class samples, but also eliminates noise samples by adaptive mediation. The combination of MSMOTE and AdaBoost are applied to several highly and moderately imbalanced data sets. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of MSMOTE is better than SMOTEBoost in the minority class and F-values are also improved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSE.2009.756","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5402742/5403164/05403368.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"17","doi":"10.1109/WCSE.2009.756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MSMOTE: Improving Classification Performance When Training Data is Imbalanced","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"MSMOTE: Improving Classification Performance When Training Data is Imbalanced","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5403368/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106418","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403368/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MSMOTE: Improving Classification Performance When Training Data is Imbalanced","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"3881b013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.19102S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5402742","isNumber":"5403164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5402742","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"5403164","articleId":"5403368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5403413,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Ke","affiliation":["Research Center of Information and Digital Engineering International School of Software Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Ke","id":"37409128200"},{"name":"Bian Fu Ling","affiliation":["Research Center of Information and Digital Engineering International School of Software Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bian Fu","lastName":"Ling","id":"37411091600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5285-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3881-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5403413","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Geographic Information Systems","Diversity reception","Urban planning","Information entropy","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Testing","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","genetic algorithms","geographic information systems","town and country planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal spatial searching","advanced genetic algorithm","GIS","planning tool","urban planner","site selection","information entropy","global searching ability","EAGA program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm (GA)","self-adaptive","GIS","special optimization","individual entropy","population entropy","urban planning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403413","abstract":"This study successfully solve a spatial-searching problem by using GA (genetic algorithm) and GIS, the method can be used as a planning tool to help urban planner to improve development efficiency for site selecting.

A ranging channel consists of a set of subcarriers in specific time slots shared by multiple users, so the multiple access interference (MAI) limits the performance of ranging detectors. Different from existing methods that treat the MAI as noise, the proposed SMUD successively detects the channel paths of active ranging signals and cancels their interference for further detection. This approach significantly suppresses the MAI and improves both user detection and parameter estimation performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.080677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.080677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","startPage":"481","endPage":"487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive multiuser detection and interference cancelation for contention based OFDMA ranging channel [transactions letters]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Successive multiuser detection and interference cancelation for contention based OFDMA ranging channel [transactions letters]","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11103495","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403522/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive multiuser detection and interference cancelation for contention based OFDMA ranging channel [transactions letters]","sourcePdf":"481-tw1002-ruan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066442S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5403523,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Keum Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Keum","lastName":"Song","id":"37407139400"},{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279318900"},{"name":"Jens Zander","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, KTH, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Zander","id":"37278665600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5403523","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Power control","Downlink","Traffic control","Convergence","Channel estimation","Binary phase shift keying","Analytical models","Telecommunication traffic","Computer science education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","power control","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot power adjustment","transmit power","pilot channel","DS-CDMA mobile systems","DS-CDMA systems coherent detection","redundant pilot signals","voice traffic","data traffic","traffic channel","channel estimation","bit energy-to-noise density ratio","traffic signals","power control methods","power control algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pilot power adjustment, DS-CDMA systems, transmit power control, convergence.","Pilot power adjustment, DS-CDMA systems, transmit power control, convergence."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403523","abstract":"In DS-CDMA systems coherent detection is usually adopted by adding or multiplexing redundant pilot signals with voice or data traffic.

We provide a power-and-bandwidth efficient feedback scheme in which only ZFBF-optimal users feedback their CSI, thereby reducing the number of required feedbacks and the computational burden of exhaustive search for best users at the BS. Afterwards, we show that conventional sum-capacity maximizing scheduling policies fall short to meet the requisites of delay-sensitive applications, and we provide appropriate scheduling scheme for such-constrained users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling approach successfully meets both average and instantaneous delay constraints of delay-sensitive applications.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","startPage":"528","endPage":"533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint feedback and scheduling scheme for service-differentiated multiuser MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint feedback and scheduling scheme for service-differentiated multiuser MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105198","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403530/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint feedback and scheduling scheme for service-differentiated multiuser MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"528-tw1002-souihli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045924S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5403533,"authors":[{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293279900"},{"name":"Aylin Yener","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Yener","id":"37273211500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5403533","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1092},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Relays","Power system relaying","Peer to peer computing","Decoding","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Wireless communication","Power system modeling","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum relay power allocation","F-TDMA multiuser two-way relay networks","orthogonal channels","decode- and- forward relaying","amplify-and-forward relaying","compress-and-forward relaying","numerical results","frequency division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relaying, network coding, weighted sum-rate maximization, decode/amplify/compress-and-forward, power allocation."]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation for F/TDMA multiuser two-way relay networks","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","endPage":"551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090336","startPage":"546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403533","abstract":"We consider a multiuser two-way relay network where multiple pairs of users exchange information with the assistance of a relay node, using orthogonal channels per pair.

Unlike the previous work, we assume that the bits transmitted over the same subchannel from the source to the relay may be distributed over different subchannels when being forwarded from the relay to the destination. This not only increases the degree of freedom for transmission, but also reduces the transmission overhead significantly because the amount of feedback information required is independent of the number of subchannels. Furthermore, the transmission durations at the source and the relay are designed to be asymmetric, which also enhances the degree of freedom for transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal asymmetric resource allocation scheme achieves a higher system capacity, and has less sensitivity to channel estimation errors than the previous work. It also demonstrates a fast convergence speed.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.5403534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403534.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.5403534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal asymmetric resource allocation with limited feedback for OFDM based relay systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403534/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal asymmetric resource allocation with limited feedback for OFDM based relay systems","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11135908","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403534/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal asymmetric resource allocation with limited feedback for OFDM based relay systems","sourcePdf":"552-tw1002-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069088S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5403535,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5403535","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":154,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2958},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Signal detection","Gaussian noise","Testing","Signal to noise ratio","Energy measurement","Wireless communication","Pulse modulation","RAKE receivers","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random signals","improved energy detector","Gaussian noise","signal amplitude","arbitrary positive power operation","false alarm probability","average signal-to-noise ratio","detection probability","generalized likelihood ratio test","generalized likelihood function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy detector, probability of detection, probability of false alarm, spectrum sensing."]}],"abstract":"New and improved energy detector for random signals in Gaussian noise is proposed by replacing the squaring operation of the signal amplitude in the conventional energy detector with an arbitrary positive power operation.

In particular, we first choose the training signal to minimize the channel estimation error, and then, develop an iterative algorithm to solve for the optimum system resources such as time, power and spatial dimensions. Specifically, the algorithm finds the optimum training duration, the optimum allocation of power between training and data transmission phases, the optimum allocation of power over the antennas during the data transmission phase.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.5403543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403543.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.5403543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation and resource allocation for MIMO systems-part I: single-user analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403543/","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation and resource allocation for MIMO systems-part I: single-user analysis","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11103504","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403543/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation and resource allocation for MIMO systems-part I: single-user analysis","sourcePdf":"624-tw1002-soysal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057563S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5403544,"authors":[{"name":"Alkan Soysal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403544/5403544-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alkan Soysal received the B.

Finally, we provide a detailed numerical analysis to support the analytical results of both parts of this two-part paper.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.080100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.080100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","startPage":"632","endPage":"640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation and resource allocation for MIMO systems-part II: multi-user and numerical analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation and resource allocation for MIMO systems-part II: multi-user and numerical analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11103505","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403544/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation and resource allocation for MIMO systems-part II: multi-user and numerical analysis","sourcePdf":"632-tw1002-soysal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0667S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5403545,"authors":[{"name":"Amr El-Keyi","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Giza, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403545/5403545-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amr EI-Keyi was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1976.

The relays are equipped with multiple antennas that receive the source signals and transmit them to the destination nodes. We develop two iterative relay beamforming algorithms that can be applied in real-time. In both algorithms, the relay beamforming matrices are jointly designed by minimizing the received power at all the destination nodes while preserving the desired signal at each destination. The first algorithm requires the existence of a local processing center that computes the beamforming coefficients of all the relays. In the second algorithm, each relay can compute its beamforming coefficients locally with the help of some common information that is broadcasted from the other relays. This is achieved at the expense of enforcing the desired signal preservation constraints non-cooperatively. We provide two extensions of the proposed algorithms that allow the relays to control their transmission power and to modify the quality of service provided to different sources. Simulation results are presented validating the ability of the proposed algorithms to perform their beamforming tasks efficiently and to track rapid changes in the operating environment.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.081636","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403545.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.081636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"641","endPage":"651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming for multiuser cooperative relaying using the kalman filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming for multiuser cooperative relaying using the kalman filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403545/","volume":"9","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5403545/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11135913","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming for multiuser cooperative relaying using the kalman filter","sourcePdf":"641-tw1002-elkeyi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064471S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5403546,"authors":[{"name":"Zhemin Xu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Lehigh University, USA","Broadcom Corporation, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403546/5403546-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhemin Xu received a B.Eng. degree in Information Science and Electronic Engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, in 1998, and his M.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2001, and his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA, in 2009.

For that, we assume the antenna array to consist of dipole antennas placed side-by-side in a linear pattern and in a very limited physical space. In a first step, we will assume perfect channel state information at the receiver side only and a negligible training overhead compared with the payload. We will demonstrate that in contrast to what might be expected based on results for cases without mutual coupling, MIMO receive antenna selection can achieve higher data rates than the system using all antennas provided that the total number of receive antennas is larger than a critical value that we will further discuss. We then propose an optimal antenna selection processing that ensures rate maximization regardless of the number of antennas used. In a later step, we will address the impact of training overhead on the system achievable rate when the training overhead is considerable. We will show that such a rate is reduced dramatically due to the large amount of training overhead arising from the presence of mutual coupling. To overcome this problem, we will thus propose a novel channel estimation method, which reduces the training overhead greatly and improves the system achievable rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.080976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403546.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.080976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","startPage":"652","endPage":"661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receive antenna selection for closely-spaced antennas with mutual coupling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Receive antenna selection for closely-spaced antennas with mutual coupling","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403546/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11103506","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403546/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receive antenna selection for closely-spaced antennas with mutual coupling","sourcePdf":"652-tw1002-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108033S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5403548,"authors":[{"name":"Woohyuk Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403548/5403548-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Woohyuk Chang (S`03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, Korea, in 2001.

Assuming a slowly-varying fading interference channel with two-senders and two-receivers, the primary sender adjusts its rate and power depending on its own channel, while ignoring the secondary user. Through an optimization process, the secondary sender's rate and power are determined and the decision is made on whether the secondary sender violates the S-P interference power limit. The primary receiver removes the effect of excessive S-P interference by multiuser decoding (MUD) which jointly decodes the primary and secondary senders' data. Achievable rates of the proposed system are examined by computer simulation. It was observed that the proposed system tends to violate the SP interference power limit when the S-P channel gain is larger than the other channel gains. Remarkably, the proposed system can provide a considerably high data rate for the secondary user even without sacrificing the data rate for the primary user over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11103508","htmlLink":"/document/5403548/","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rates for cognitive radios opportunistically permitting excessive secondary-to-primary interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rates for cognitive radios opportunistically permitting excessive secondary-to-primary interference","sourcePdf":"674-tw1002-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135967S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5403549,"authors":[{"name":"Lingkun Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403549/5403549-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingkun Kong received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering and the M.Eng. degree in communications and signal processing from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

The GMLST combines the benefits of the Vertical Bell-Labs LAyered Space-Time (VBLAST) scheme and Space-Time Coding (STC). The GMLST is serially concatenated with a Unity-Rate Code (URC) and an IRCC which are used to facilitate near-capacity operation with the aid of an EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart based design. Reduced-complexity iterative multistage Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is employed in the GMLST decoder, instead of the significantly more complex Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection. For the sake of approaching the maximum attainable rate, iterative decoding is invoked to achieve decoding convergence by exchanging extrinsic information across the three serial component decoders. Finally, it is shown that the SIC-based iteratively detected IRCC-URC-GMLST system is capable of providing a feasible trade-off between the affordable computational complexity and the achievable system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.081117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403549.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.081117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-complexity near-capacity downlink iteratively decoded generalized multi-layer space-time coding using irregular convolutional codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-complexity near-capacity downlink iteratively decoded generalized multi-layer space-time coding using irregular convolutional codes","volume":"9","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11135914","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403549/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-complexity near-capacity downlink iteratively decoded generalized multi-layer space-time coding using irregular convolutional codes","sourcePdf":"684-tw1002-kong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123929S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5403551,"authors":[{"name":"Saad Al-Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Saad Al-Ahmadi received his M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia in April 2002 and joined the the Department of Electrical Engineering at KFUPM as a lecturer in August 2003.

The use of the Nakagami probability density function (PDF) to model multipath fading and the Gamma PDF to model shadowing has led to the generalized-K model for composite fading. However, further derivations using the generalized K PDF are quite involved due to the computational and analytical difficulties associated with the arising special functions. In this paper, the approximation of the generalized-K PDF by a Gamma PDF using the moment matching method is explored. Subsequently, an adjustable form of the expressions obtained by matching the first two positive moments, to overcome the arising numerical and/or analytical limitations of higher order moment matching, is proposed. The optimal values of the adjustment factor for different integer and non-integer values of the multipath fading and shadowing parameters are given. Moreover, the approach introduced in this paper can be used to well-approximate the distribution of the sum of independent generalized-K random variables by a gamma distribution; the need for such results arises in various emerging distributed communication technologies and systems such as coordinated multipoint transmission and reception schemes including distributed antenna systems and cooperative relay networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","volume":"9","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11103510","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403551/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the approximation of the generalized-\u039a distribution by a gamma distribution for modeling composite fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the approximation of the generalized-\u039a distribution by a gamma distribution for modeling composite fading channels","sourcePdf":"706-tw1002-alahmadi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132746S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5403552,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Stephenne","affiliation":["INRS Energie, Materiaux et Telecommunications, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403552/5403552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Stephenne was born in Quebec, Canada, on May 8, 1969.

The proposed solutions are based on the presence of some dedicated pilot tones within the signal spectrum, which are traditionally employed in OFDM systems to track channel variations and residual frequency errors. The main obstacle is the large number of parameters involved in the estimation process, which makes the uplink synchronization a rather challenging task. A practical solution to this problem relies on the separation of the received signals before the estimation procedure is started. This way, the RCFOs and SFOs of different users are estimated independently with affordable complexity. We propose two alternative approaches for users' separation.

We find that the probability that overloading is not possible decays exponentially with the size of the system as long as the number of data streams is less than twice the minimum number of antennas. We give an explicit formula to calculate this probability for any antenna configuration in presence of correlated Rayleigh fading.

We first consider a network consisting of two source nodes and a single relay node, which is used to aid communication between the two source nodes. For this scenario, we investigate transmission over two, three or four time slots. We show that the two time slot PNC scheme offers a higher maximum sum-rate, but a lower sum-bit error rate (BER) than the four time slot transmission scheme for a number of practical scenarios. We also show that the three time slot PNC scheme offers a good compromise between the two and four time slot transmission schemes, and also achieves the best maximum sum-rate and/or sum-BER in certain practical scenarios. To facilitate comparison, we derive new closed-form expressions for the outage probability, maximum sum-rate and sum-BER. We also consider an opportunistic relaying scheme for a network with multiple relay nodes, where a single relay is chosen to maximize either the maximum sum-rate or minimize the sum-BER. Our results indicate that the opportunistic relaying scheme can significantly improve system performance, compared to a single relay network.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403557.pdf","startPage":"764","endPage":"777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical physical layer network coding for two-way relay channels: performance analysis and comparison","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Practical physical layer network coding for two-way relay channels: performance analysis and comparison","volume":"9","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403557/","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105203","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403557/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical physical layer network coding for two-way relay channels: performance analysis and comparison","sourcePdf":"764-tw1002-louie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12114S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"394","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5403558,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403558/5403558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andre Lei (M'08) was born in Hong Kong, in 1983.

We assume that the sensors make independent local decisions on the M hypotheses under test and report these decisions to the fusion center using differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), so as to avoid the channel estimation overhead entailed by coherent decision fusion. For this setup we derive the optimal and three low-complexity, suboptimal fusion rules which do not require knowledge of the instantaneous fading gains. The suboptimal fusion rules are obtained by applying certain approximations to the optimal fusion rule and are referred to as Chair-Varshney (CV), ideal local sensors (ILS), and max-log fusion rules. Since all proposed fusion rules exploit an observation window of at least two symbol intervals, we refer to them collectively as multiple-symbol differential (MSD) fusion rules. For binary hypothesis testing, we derive performance bounds for the optimal fusion rule and exact or approximate analytical expressions for the probabilities of false alarm and detection for all three suboptimal fusion rules. Simulation and analytical results show that whereas the CV and ILS fusion rules approach the performance of the optimal fusion rule for high and low channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), respectively, the max-log fusion rule performs close-to-optimal for the entire range of SNRs. Furthermore, in fast fading channels significant performance gains can be achieved for the considered MSD fusion rules by increasing the observation window to more than two symbol intervals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403558.pdf","startPage":"778","endPage":"790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-symbol differential decision fusion for mobile wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Sensor fusion","Testing","Fading","Performance analysis","Differential phase shift keying","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Channel estimation","Analytical models","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","differential phase shift keying","fading channels","mobile radio","probability","time-varying channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-symbol differential decision fusion","mobile wireless sensor networks","time-varying channel","differential phase shift keying","DPSK modulation","channel estimation overhead","low-complexity suboptimal fusion","ideal local sensors","max-log fusion rules","binary hypothesis testing","false alarm probability","detection probability","ILS fusion rule approach","signal-to-noise ratios","fast fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks, multiple hypothesis testing, multiple symbol differential detection (MSDD), sphere decoding, data fusion, fading channels.

The proposed OMS scheme better balances the tradeoff between multiuser diversity and multicast gain by transmitting to a subset of users in each time slot using the maximal data rate that ensures successful decoding by these users. We first analyze the system delay in homogeneous networks by capitalizing on extreme value theory and derive the optimal selection ratio (i.e., the portion of users that are selected in each time slot) that minimizes the delay. Then, we extend results to heterogeneous networks where users are subject to different channel statistics. By partitioning users into multiple approximately homogeneous rings, we turn a heterogeneous network into a composite of smaller homogeneous networks and derive the optimal selection ratio for the heterogeneous network. Computer simulations confirm theoretical results and illustrate that the proposed OMS can achieve significant performance gains in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks as compared with the conventional unicast and broadcast scheduling.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403559.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized opportunistic multicast scheduling (OMS) over wireless cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Delay effects","Base stations","Fading","Decoding","Delay systems","Statistics","Computer simulation","Performance gain","Unicast"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","decoding","diversity reception","fading channels","scheduling","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized opportunistic multicast scheduling","wireless cellular networks","fountain-encoded data","base station","quasi-static fading channels","OMS scheme","multiuser diversity","multicast gain","decoding","heterogeneous networks","channel statistics","computer simulations","theoretical results","extreme value theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Opportunistic scheduling, multiuser diversity, multicast gain, extreme value theory.

The optimal multiple antenna spectrum sensing detector needs to know the channel gains, noise variance, and primary user signal variance. In practice some or all of these parameters may be unknown, so we derive the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) detectors under these circumstances. The proposed GLR detector, in which all the parameters are unknown, is a blind and invariant detector with a low computational complexity. We also analytically compute the missed detection and false alarm probabilities for the proposed GLR detectors. The simulation results provide the available traded-off in using multiple antenna techniques for spectrum sensing and illustrates the robustness of the proposed GLR detectors compared to the traditional energy detector when there is some uncertainty in the given noise variance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.02.090385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.02.090385","startPage":"814","endPage":"823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403561.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple antenna spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiple antenna spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11135919","publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5403561/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple antenna spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","sourcePdf":"814-tw1002-taherpour.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114932S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"323","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5403562,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios K.

Such systems typically use nonlinear modulation and detection, due to their low power consumption. Increasing their performance by means of multiple antennas at the AP and the SNs has not been considered, since this would violate the stringent power and cost constraints at the SN. We consider SNs with MIMO receivers that perform a nonlinear operation on the complex-valued received signal (amplitude or phase detection). These receivers enjoy the low-cost, low-power, low-complexity characteristics that are crucial for a sensor network. Such nonlinear MIMO systems are first introduced and studied here. They bring the high-rate, high-performance world of MIMO systems and the low-cost, low-complexity world of sensor networks together. We only consider the single-user MIMO system between the AP and one SN, and study the fundamental limits of such systems. We compute achievable rates under perfect and noisy CSI at the SN, and observe that these systems also achieve spatial multiplexing gain, albeit different to legacy linear MIMO systems. We quantify and analyze these gains using numerical means, and give insight into the effect of the nonlinearity on the information theoretic limits of nonlinear MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403562.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear MIMO: affordable MIMO technology for wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Tin","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Energy consumption","Receiving antennas","Costs","Phase detection","Sensor systems","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","demodulation","MIMO communication","modulation","numerical analysis","space division multiplexing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear MIMO technology","wireless sensor networks","access point","low-complexity nodes","low-power communication nodes","nonlinear modulation","nonlinear detection","multiple antennas","MIMO receivers","single-user MIMO system","spatial multiplexing gain","information theoretic limits","numerical method","amplitude detection","phase detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks, achievable rates, spatial multiplexing, robustness, nonlinear MIMO, nonlinear receivers, perfect CSIR, noisy CSIR."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear MIMO: affordable MIMO technology for wireless sensor networks","volume":"9","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5403562/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105205","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear MIMO: affordable MIMO technology for wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"824-tw1002-psaltopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109242S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5403565,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Harrysson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Theory, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5403520/5403565/5403565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fredrik Harrysson (M'97-SM'07) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1994 from Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg and the Licentiate degree in 2009 from Lund University, Lund, Sweden, where he is currently an industrial Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Information Technology.","From 1995 to 1996 he was a research engineer at the Department of Microwave Systems of the Swedish Defense Research Establishment, Link\u00f6ping, working with wideband microwave circuits.

In this paper we investigate a composite channel method that synthetically combines double-directional measurements of the user-less propagation channel with measured super-antenna patterns, i.e., patterns of the combined antenna-casing-user arrangement. We experimentally evaluate the method by comparing results (power, capacity, and eigenvalue distribution) obtained from this composite method with direct measurements in the same environment. The measurements were done in two static 8 \u00d7 4 MIMO scenarios at 2.6 GHz, with the user indoors and the base station located outdoors and indoors, respectively. A realistic user phantom together with a\"smart-phone\" handset mock-up with four antenna elements was used, and different configurations and orientations were tested. The method gives statistical distributions of the MIMO eigenvalues, that are close to the measured. By using the composite method, we found that the user, apart from introducing hand and body loss that mainly decreases the SNR of the channel, slightly increases the correlation between the fading at the antenna elements.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5403520/05403565.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.02.090588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient experimental evaluation of a MIMO handset with user influence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403565/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient experimental evaluation of a MIMO handset with user influence","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105207","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403565/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient experimental evaluation of a MIMO handset with user influence","sourcePdf":"853-tw1002-harrysson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081957S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5403520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5403520","articleId":"5403565","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5403602,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrie C.

Non-binary Raptor codes turn out to represent an appealing option for applications requiring severe constraints in terms of performance versus overhead, especially for small source block sizes.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.02.092080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5403597/05403626.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.02.092080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance versus overhead for fountain codes over F<sub>q</sub>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403626/","displayDocTitle":"Performance versus overhead for fountain codes over F<sub>q</sub>","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11103491","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403626/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance versus overhead for fountain codes over F<sub>q</sub>","sourcePdf":"178-cl1002-liva.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042723S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5403597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5403597","articleId":"5403626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5403627,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406726800"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"},{"name":"Xinmei Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xinmei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281379300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5403627","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":720},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Galois fields","Iterative decoding","Chaos","Hamming distance","Electrical capacitance tomography","Modular construction","Length measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-cyclic codes","nonbinary LDPC cycle code","singer perfect difference set","low density parity-check code","parity-check matrix","Tanner graph","code length","Gallager lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonbinary LDPC cycle code, quasi-cyclic (QC) code, girth, Singer perfect difference set"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403627","abstract":"A low-density parity-check (LDPC) code whose parity-check matrix consists of weight-2 columns is known as a cycle code.

A high-performance SRAM is proposed using a 1.8 V/0.18 \u00bfm CMOS standard process from Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd (CHRT). It incorporates a discharging mechanism that helps eliminating the waiting time during the read operation, hence offering a faster sensing speed and lower power consumption. Our post-layout simulation results have shown that it improves the sensing speed and power consumption by 51.4%, and 62.47%, respectively when compared with the best published design. The total power-delay-product (PDP) is 81.79% better.

Those two dominant factors impose a range of conflicting restrictions and demands on the design of the readout integrated circuits (ROIC). Some of the key challenges are: limited silicon real estate available per pixel, wide band analog electronics, high digital processing speed and integration with the rest of the system. The read-out electronics for radiation detectors reported in the literature can be classified into four groups regarding the technology and complexity. While the overall complexity increases, the complexity of individual channels is trimmed down as much as possible to accommodate larger number of channels into a limited silicon area. Part of our current work at Monash Centre for Synchrotron Science (MCSS) is the reduction in the likelihood of photons pile-ups and making their detection less erroneous. The pile-up is defined as overlapping of photons that cannot be discriminated. The work is also focused on options for improving output pulse shaping, as a factor relevant for noise reduction and pile-up discrimination.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Biomedical imaging","Radiation detectors","Silicon","Photonic integrated circuits","Wideband","Integrated circuit technology","Synchrotrons","Pulse shaping methods","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","application specific integrated circuits","biomedical imaging","integrated circuit design","particle detectors","pulse shaping","pulse shaping circuits","readout electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC design","biomedical imaging","readout integrated circuits","radiation detectors","photons pile-up discrimination","output pulse shaping","noise reduction","read-out electronics","limited silicon real estate","wide band analog electronics","high digital processing speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASIC","radiation detector","charge preamplifier","pulse shaper","pile-up","ADC","readout electronics"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398766/5403682/05403786.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Key challenges for ASIC design and implementation for biomedical imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Key challenges for ASIC design and implementation for biomedical imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403786/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403786/","accessionNumber":"11105362","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key challenges for ASIC design and implementation for biomedical imaging","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"D26P0281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087764S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398766","isNumber":"5403682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398766","xplore-issue":"5403682","articleId":"5403786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIV","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5403795,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While many designs of LDPC decoders for specific classes of codes exist in the literature, the design of a general LDPC decoder capable of supporting random LDPC codes is still challenging. The method proposed in this paper tries to pack different check node (CN) and variable node (VN) messages in the Tanner graph representation of the LDPC code, and is therefore called message packing. This method takes advantage of the fact that for high-rate LDPC's the CN's degree is much larger than the VN's, and two distinct methods for delivering the messages to the CNs and VNs are proposed. Using the proposed interconnection network (IN) results in lower complexity decoding of LDPC codes when compared to other designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general decoding framework for high-rate LDPC codes","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398766/5403682/05403795.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A general decoding framework for high-rate LDPC codes","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403795/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general decoding framework for high-rate LDPC codes","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P27P0177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076211S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398766","isNumber":"5403682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398766","xplore-issue":"5403682","articleId":"5403795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIV","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5403815,"authors":[{"name":"Zesheng Chen","affiliation":["Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Zesheng Chen","id":"37087990293"},{"name":"Todor Cooklev","affiliation":["Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Todor","lastName":"Cooklev","id":"37297027800"},{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Chao Chen","id":"37087989242"},{"name":"Carlos Pomalaza-R\u00e1ez","affiliation":["Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Pomalaza-R\u00e1ez","id":"38274982600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5738-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5737-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5736-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"CD","value":"1097-2641"}],"articleNumber":"5403815","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":915},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emulation","Cognitive radio","Communication channels","Signal design","Learning systems","Machine learning algorithms","Probability distribution","Chaotic communication","Intelligent networks","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emulation attacks","emulation defenses","cognitive radio networks","estimation techniques","learning methods","communication channels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403815","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2009.5403815","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 28th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","abstract":"Primary user emulation attacks are a potential security threat to cognitive radio networks.

The comparison-based self-diagnosis approach assigns tasks to the nodes that need to be diagnosed. The outcomes from each pair of units performing the same task are compared, and based on such comparison their fault status is identified. In this work, we consider symmetric t-comparison-based diagnosable systems in which at most t nodes can fail permanently at the same time. We introduce a novel backpropagation neural network-based (BPNN) approach to implement a new fault identification algorithm. The BPNN diagnosis algorithm uses the comparison approach to collect the agreements and disagreements among the nodes, and then uses these comparison outcomes to identify which nodes are faulty and which ones are fault-free. The BPNN-based diagnosis algorithm needs first to undergo an extensive training phase using various faulty situations. Results from a thorough simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the BPNN-based self diagnosis algorithm for randomly generated diagnosable systems, making it a viable addition to existing diagnosis algorithms. The novel approach is shown to scale very well for large systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403826/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11106624","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403826/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient symmetric comparison-based self-diagnosis using backpropagation artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient symmetric comparison-based self-diagnosis using backpropagation artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"ipccc1569246675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065804S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398688","isNumber":"5403797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398688","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5403797","articleId":"5403826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5403847,"authors":[{"name":"Danda B.

We formulate the optimal resource allocation for CR users as a constrained optimization problem and illustrate the proposed approach with numerical results obtained from simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2009.5403847","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 28th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398688/5403797/05403847.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2009.5403847","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 28th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","startPage":"425","endPage":"430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint precoder and power adaptation for cognitive radios in interference systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint precoder and power adaptation for cognitive radios in interference systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403847/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403847/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106635","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint precoder and power adaptation for cognitive radios in interference systems","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"ipccc1569260208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079229S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398688","isNumber":"5403797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398688","xplore-issue":"5403797","articleId":"5403847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5403851,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Waheed","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Waheed","id":"37392846000"},{"name":"Anni Cai","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Anni","lastName":"Cai","id":"37267103300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5738-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5737-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5736-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"CD","value":"1097-2641"}],"articleNumber":"5403851","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Chromium","OFDM","Interference","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms","Wireless communication","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary algorithms","radio resource management","cognitive radio network","dynamic spectrum access","binary particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm","OFDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","radio resource management","evolutionary algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) technology employing dynamic spectrum access (DSA) improves spectrum utilization by exploiting its unused portions and provides a solution to the apparent spectrum scarcity problem.

A key aspect of these radios is the `cognition' gained through a spectrum scanning process. The benefits of this cognition is apparent and well studied in terms of better performance of communication. The benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption, however, due to easier channel access and less contention have not been quantified in prior work. On the other hand, spectrum scanning to gain cognition is a power-intensive process and the costs incurred in terms of lost energy need to be accounted for. Thus, it is not clear whether a cognitive radio would be more energy efficient than a conventional radio, and if so, under what circumstances. This focus on energy consumption is particularly important when considering portable communication devices that are energy constrained. This work takes a first step in this direction by exploring whether a cognitive radio can save energy over a conventional radio in the ad hoc wireless LAN scenario. The interplay between different important parameters to this problem is analyzed and their impact on energy consumption studied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11136452","htmlLink":"/document/5403857/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Are cognitive radios energy efficient?

The circuit to some extent is able to ease the strict restriction on accuracy to achieve tremendous improvements in both the power consumption and speed performance. When compared to its conventional counterparts, the proposed ETAII is able to achieve more than 60% improvement in the power-delay product (PDP). The proposed ETAII is an enhancement of our earlier design, the ETAI, which has problem adding small number inputs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Very large scale

Experimental results of XC4010E demonstrate that 17 configurations are required to achieve 100% coverage for a FPGA-under-test.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398766/5403682/05403878.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full coverage manufacturing testing for SRAM-based FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403878/","displayDocTitle":"Full coverage manufacturing testing for SRAM-based FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403878/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135972","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full coverage manufacturing testing for SRAM-based FPGA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"C54P0225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058005S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398766","isNumber":"5403682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398766","xplore-issue":"5403682","articleId":"5403878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIV","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5403889,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Yam Lo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ming-Yam Lo","id":"37396309300"},{"name":"Wing-Hung Ki","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wing-Hung Ki","id":"37269638700"},{"name":"Wai-Ho Mow","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wai-Ho Mow","id":"37271223800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-9-8108-2468-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0631"}],"articleNumber":"5403889","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching circuits","Iterative decoding","Sampling methods","Switches","Voltage","Circuit simulation","Error analysis","Capacitors","Frequency","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched-current sample-and-hold circuit","current mode analog iterative decoders","capacitor divider","sampling switch","cascode transistor","CMOS peaking current source","frequency 20 MHz","power 22.275 muW","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["switched-current","sample-and-hold","analog iterative decoder","supply-independent current source"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 20MHz switched-current sample-and-hold circuit for current mode analog iterative decoders","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403682","endPage":"286","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398766/5403682/05403889.pdf","startPage":"283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403889","abstract":"A high-frequency low-power switched-current (SI) sample-and-hold (S/H) of a current-mode analog iterative decoder is proposed.

Instead of designing array weights, our method synthesizes unequally-spaced array with uniform antenna weights. The effect of mutual coupling is considered when we search a set of optimum antenna positions. The determination of the antenna positions is a nonlinear optimization problem because the positions are arranged as the parameters of an exponential or trigonometric function. This nonlinear optimization problem is solved by using an improved genetic algorithm. Since the process of digitization and complex weighting (amplification and phase-shifting) is not required in the implementation of the designed array, the complexity and cost of antenna array implementation can be significantly reduced. Experiment results also show that designing the positions of antennas in an array is more likely to achieve lower sidelobe level than designing the array weights. These properties support that the proposed method is suitable for practical applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna array synthesis in presence of mutual coupling effect for low cost implementation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398766/5403682/05403919.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5403919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Antenna array synthesis in presence of mutual coupling effect for low cost implementation","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5403919/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105317","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna array synthesis in presence of mutual coupling effect for low cost implementation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"B44P0277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066776S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398766","isNumber":"5403682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398766","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5403682","articleId":"5403919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIV","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5403929,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Fang","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Zheng Fang","id":"37401389800"},{"name":"HongYu Yu","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"HongYu Yu","id":"37275012400"},{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xiang Li","id":"37406893400"},{"name":"Kin-Leong Pey","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Kin-Leong Pey","id":"37268251000"},{"name":"Wenjun Liu","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Wenjun Liu","id":"37538053300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-9-8108-2468-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0631"}],"articleNumber":"5403929","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hafnium oxide","Voltage","Temperature dependence","Tin","MIM capacitors","Sputtering","Random access memory","Transmission electron microscopy","Chemical analysis","Semiconductor films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hafnium compounds","ion mobility","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive RAM devices","temperature dependent switching","high performance resistive random access memory","lower oxygen ions activation potential barrier","oxygen vacancy assisted conduction filament formation","HfO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resistive switching","temperature dependence"]}],"abstract":"High performance resistive random access memory (RRAM) based on HfO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n has been prepared and its temperature dependant switching has been investigated in this work.

In this paper we investigate the CORDIC architecture, that can be used for various signal processing algorithms and is preeminently suitable for AL. For fast functional testing, we propose a methodology to describe AL in VHDL. An adiabatic CORDIC-based DCT is used as a test vehicle to demonstrate on system level the applicability of AL for ultra-low-power digital signal processing. We present an estimation method for the energy consumption and therewith compare a variety of static CMOS implementations of the DCT to our adiabatic DCT. The estimation results are verified by simulating the whole system in a 130 nm CMOS technology for various supply voltages. Even at a low supply voltage of 0.8 V the adiabatic DCT's energy consumption is less than 15% compared to the static CMOS implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398766/5403682/05403965.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5403682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5403965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saving potentials of Adiab.

In this paper, we target one aspect of this trade-off: area versus average delay. The NoC architecture generation is formulated as a two-objective optimization problem and a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based technique is used to solve it. According to the application requirements and the design constraints, the optimization process could be controlled by the designer by specifying weight factors for area and delay. As a proof of concept, our technique is applied to a case study of an Audio Video (AV) application. Results show that the proposed solution is a promising way to achieve the best architecture with respect to both delay and area.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Design and Test Workshop (IDT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398724/5404079/05404111.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Design and Test Workshop (IDT)","doi":"10.1109/IDT.2009.5404111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDT.2009.5404111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5404079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area and delay optimization for Networks-on-Chip architectures using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Network-on-a-chip","Delay","Computer architecture","Computer networks","Energy consumption","Costs","Genetic engineering","Analytical models","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","genetic algorithms","integrated circuit design","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networks-on-chip architecture design","genetic algorithm","audio video application","delay optimization","area optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm (GA)","Networks-on-chip (NoC)","NoC architecture generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Area and delay optimization for Networks-on-Chip architectures using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404111/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105271","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area and delay optimization for Networks-on-Chip architectures using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"idt09submission068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082075S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398724","isNumber":"5404079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398724","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5404079","articleId":"5404111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5404123,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ghandour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghandour","id":"37403722400"},{"name":"Kassem Fawaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Kassem","lastName":"Fawaz","id":"37403655200"},{"name":"Ali Chehab","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Chehab","id":"37273994800"},{"name":"Ayman Kayssi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Kayssi","id":"37273921000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5750-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5748-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-0601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-061X"}],"articleNumber":"5404123","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel integrated method for testing gate-oxide shorts due to pinhole defects in the gate oxide of CMOS circuits using a wavelet transform-based transient current (i\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DDT</sub>\n) analysis technique.

The MOS transistor is modeled using a two-dimensional non-linear split model.

It has been demonstrated that by appropriately optimizing the devices for subthreshold logic, total energy consumption can be reduced significantly. One of the major concerns for subthreshold circuit design is increased sensitivity to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. In this paper, we critically study the effect of variations of different device and environmental parameters like gate oxide thickness, channel length, threshold voltage, supply voltage, temperature, and reverse body bias on subthreshold circuit performance for 32 nm bulk CMOS. From the study, we conclude that alternative devices like double-gate silicon-on-insulator (DGSOI) are better candidates in terms of performance, robustness and PVT insensitivity as compared to bulk circuits for both static CMOS and pseudo NMOS logic families. We also study the performance and robustness comparisons of bulk CMOS and DGSOI subthreshold basic logic gates with and without parameter variations and we observe 60-70% improvement in power delay product and roughly 50% better tolerance to PVT variations of DGSOI subthreshold logic circuits compared to bulk CMOS subthreshold circuits at the 32 nm node.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404208","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Logic gates","Circuit

behind walls. The method combines primitive-based modeling of humans with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation of walls. Realistic motions of humans are generated from computer animation data. The time-varying human radar cross section is simulated using the primitive-based prediction technique. The scattered returns of humans behind walls are then simulated by a hybrid of the human simulation model with the through-wall propagation data generated from FDTD. The resulting simulator is used to investigate the effects of walls of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous types on human micro-Dopplers. It is found that while through-wall propagation affects the magnitude response of the Doppler spectrogram in the form of attenuation and fading, it only introduces very minor distortions on the actual Doppler frequencies from the body parts. This is corroborated by measurement data collected using a Doppler radar, as well as by a point-scatterer analysis of refraction and multipath introduced by walls.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2037219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5437364/05404249.pdf","startPage":"2015","endPage":"2023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2037219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and Analysis of Human Micro-Dopplers in Through-Wall Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and Analysis of Human Micro-Dopplers in Through-Wall Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","volume":"48","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404249/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204333","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and Analysis of Human Micro-Dopplers in Through-Wall Environments","sourcePdf":"tgrs-sundarram-2037219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06553S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5437364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5437364","articleId":"5404249","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5404251,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Rui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5467345/5404251/5404251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang-Rui Chen (M\u201905) was born in Changhua, Taiwan, in 1971.

Simulations have been performed by 2-D finite-element analysis in order to determine the current spectrum and the magnetic flux distribution due to this failure. The diagnostic just based on motor current signature analysis can be confused by eccentricity failure because the harmonic content is the same. Moreover, it can only be applied under stationary conditions. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a novel method is used based upon the Hilbert-Huang transform. It represents time-dependent series in a 2-D time-frequency domain by extracting instantaneous frequency components through an empirical-mode decomposition process. This tool is applied by running the motor under nonstationary conditions of velocity. The experimental results show the reliability and feasibility of the methodology in order to diagnose the demagnetization of a PMSM.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2037922","publicationTitle":"IEEE

However, conventional AFM-based nanomanipulation is inefficient because of the serial scan-manipulation-scan process involved. In this paper, high-efficiency automated nanomanipulation with a parallel imaging/manipulation force microscope (PIMM) is presented. With the PIMM, image scan and nanomanipulation can be performed in parallel through the collaboration between two cantilevers: one cantilever acts as an imaging sensor and the other is used as a manipulating tool. Two automated manipulation schemes were introduced for normal- and high-speed image scanning, respectively. An automated parallel manipulation task is managed by system control software with multithread through a procedure of dynamic image processing, task planning, two-tip collaboration, and a controlled pushing manipulation with amplitude feedback from the cantilevers. The efficiency of automated parallel nanomanipulation with normal-speed image scanning was validated by building nanoparticle patterns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6122889/05404293.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2010.2041359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2010.2041359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6122889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Automated Nanomanipulation With Parallel Imaging/Manipulation Force Microscopy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atomic force microscopy","Nanoparticles","Automatic control","Control systems","Collaborative software","Nanowires","Nanotubes","Force sensors","Collaborative tools","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","cantilevers","high-speed optical techniques","image recognition","image scanners","image sensors","nanopatterning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated nanomanipulation","atomic force microscope","AFM","nanoparticle manipulation","nanowire manipulation","nanotube manipulation","nanocharacterization","biomanipulation","serial scan-manipulation-scan process","parallel imaging-manipulation force microscopy","cantilevers","imaging sensor","normal-speed image scanning","high-speed image scanning","multithread structures","dynamic image processing","task planning","two-tip collaboration","controlled pushing manipulation","amplitude feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atomic force microscope (AFM)","automated","high efficiency","nanoparticle push","parallel nanomanipulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Automated Nanomanipulation With Parallel Imaging/Manipulation Force Microscopy","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5404293/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12443914","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Automated Nanomanipulation With Parallel Imaging/Manipulation Force Microscopy","sourcePdf":"tnano-xie-2041359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080863S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6122889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6122889","articleId":"5404293","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5404314,"authors":[{"name":"Kalpana Seshadrinathan","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5464460/5404314/5404314-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kalpana Seshadrinathan (S'03\u2013M'09) received the B.Tech. degree from the University of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, India, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","She is currently a System Engineer with Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ.

Methods to assess the visual quality of digital videos as perceived by human observers are becoming increasingly important, due to the large number of applications that target humans as the end users of video. Owing to the many approaches to video quality assessment (VQA) that are being developed, there is a need for a diverse independent public database of distorted videos and subjective scores that is freely available. The resulting Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) Video Quality Database contains 150 distorted videos (obtained from ten uncompressed reference videos of natural scenes) that were created using four different commonly encountered distortion types. Each video was assessed by 38 human subjects, and the difference mean opinion scores (DMOS) were recorded. We also evaluated the performance of several state-of-the-art, publicly available full-reference VQA algorithms on the new database. A statistical evaluation of the relative performance of these algorithms is also presented. The database has a dedicated web presence that will be maintained as long as it remains relevant and the data is available online.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2042111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2042111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5464460/05404314.pdf","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Study of Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Video","volume":"19","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404314/","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11292940","pubMedId":"20129861","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404314/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Video","sourcePdf":"19tip07-kseshadrinathan-2042111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077245S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5464460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"685","xplore-issue":"5464460","articleId":"5404314","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5404316,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanos P.

When defining the likelihood model, the proposed method models both spectral peaks and non-peak regions (frequencies further than a musical quarter tone from all observed peaks). It is shown that the peak likelihood and the non-peak region likelihood act as a complementary pair. The former helps find F0s that have harmonics that explain peaks, while the latter helps avoid F0s that have harmonics in non-peak regions. Parameters of these models are learned from monophonic and polyphonic training data. This paper proposes an iterative greedy search strategy to estimate F0s one by one, to avoid the combinatorial problem of concurrent F0 estimation. It also proposes a polyphony estimation method to terminate the iterative process. Finally, this paper proposes a postprocessing method to refine polyphony and F0 estimates using neighboring frames. This paper also analyzes the relative contributions of different components of the proposed method. It is shown that the refinement component eliminates many inconsistent estimation errors. Evaluations are done on ten recorded four-part J. S. Bach chorales. Results show that the proposed method shows superior F0 estimation and polyphony estimation compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2042119","startPage":"2121","endPage":"2133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2042119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5559658/05404324.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Fundamental Frequency Estimation by Modeling Spectral Peaks and Non-Peak Regions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404324/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple Fundamental Frequency Estimation by Modeling Spectral Peaks and Non-Peak Regions","volume":"18","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5404324/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11513409","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Fundamental Frequency Estimation by Modeling Spectral Peaks and Non-Peak Regions","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-zduan-2042119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107343S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5559658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5559658","articleId":"5404324","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":5404342,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Spinello","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5475457/5404342/5404342-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Davide Spinello received the B.S. degree and the Laurea degree in environmental engineering from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. in engineering mechanics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, in 2006.","From 2007 to 2009, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Autonomous Systems and Control Laboratory, Virginia Tech.

Traditional time-current curve (TCC) analysis is known to not fully communicate fuse selectivity; hence, fuse manufacturers publish device ratio guidelines for selection of fuse types and sizes. Recent publications of selectivity tables by circuit manufacturers also demonstrate that traditional TCCs are often insufficient to fully communicate circuit breaker selectivity. Traditional TCCs can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding circuit breaker fuse selectivity, indicating more or less selectivity than may be possible. The authors will describe various methods for the assessment of selectivity in systems using both fuses and circuit breakers together, with either device on the line side. The methods will demonstrate that selectivity above what TCCs demonstrate may be possible if devices are selected correctly and that traditional TCC analysis can also incorrectly demonstrate more selectivity than a more thorough analysis would predict. The methods lend themselves to analysis that a power system engineer can perform with published information or information that may be requested from manufacturers.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2041079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5433727/05404355.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2041079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5433727","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selectivity Analysis in Low-Voltage Power Distribution Systems With Fuses and Circuit Breakers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-april  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404355/","displayDocTitle":"Selectivity Analysis in Low-Voltage Power Distribution Systems With Fuses and Circuit Breakers","volume":"46","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404355/","publicationDate":"March-april 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11204114","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selectivity Analysis in Low-Voltage Power Distribution Systems With Fuses and Circuit Breakers","sourcePdf":"tia-valdes-2041079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052889S","chronDate":"March-april  2010","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5433727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5433727","articleId":"5404355","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5404360,"authors":[{"name":"Elisa Magosso","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5475408/5404360/5404360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Elisa Magosso was born in Mantova, Italy, in 1971.

Many studies show strong evidence for visual-tactile integrations. Understanding how visual and tactile information are merged together is still a challenging problem. Here, a neural network model was used to investigate the mechanisms underlying visual-tactile interactions. It includes two unimodal areas (visual and tactile, respectively), sending feedforward connections into a downstream bimodal area. The unimodal areas influence each other via two synaptic mechanisms: feedback synapses from the bimodal area and direct reciprocal connections. The network reproduces a variety of visual-tactile interactions: 1) detection of faint tactile stimuli is facilitated by concomitant visual input; 2) tactile spatial resolution is improved by visual information; 3) cross-modal advantages are maximum when poor unisensory information is available (inverse effectiveness); and 4) conflict situations are resolved based on the more reliable sensory cue. The model identifies distinct roles for the feedback and direct synapses: the first are fundamental to improve detection of low-intensity tactile stimuli in cross-modal stimulation, and the second are mostly implicated in visual enhancement of tactile spatial localization and resolution. A better comprehension of how vision and touch interact in the neural system may contribute to physiological knowledge, clinical practice, and technological applications.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2010.2040750","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5475408/05404360.pdf","startPage":"598","endPage":"612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2010.2040750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Information From Vision and Touch: A Neural Network Modeling Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Information From Vision and Touch: A Neural Network Modeling Study","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328252","pubMedId":"20129867","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5404360/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Information From Vision and Touch: A Neural Network Modeling Study","sourcePdf":"titb-magosso-2040750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13971S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5475408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5475408","articleId":"5404360","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5404373,"authors":[{"name":"Zaid Al-Ars","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer Engineering Faculty of EE, Mathematics and CS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zaid","lastName":"Al-Ars","id":"38278163800"},{"name":"Said Hamdioui","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer Engineering Faculty of EE Mathematics and CS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Hamdioui","id":"37273368500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5750-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5748-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-0601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-061X"}],"articleNumber":"5404373","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-algorithmic stress optimization using simulation for DRAMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404373","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Testing","Circuit faults","Circuit simulation","Optimization methods","Random access memory","Analytical models","Space technology","Timing","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","DRAM chips","failure analysis","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonalgorithmic stress optimization","DRAM devices","memory devices","optimization values","electrical Spice simulation","Qimonda","memory cells","strap problem","bit line coupling effects","faulty cell detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM testing","non-algorithmic stresses","stress optimization","Spice simulation","strap problem"]}],"abstract":"Stress optimization for memory devices is a complex process due to the continuous space of possible optimization values for relevant parameters.

The proposed power filter design is based on the minimization of a multi objective function. The main power filter objective function includes minimum harmonic current penetration into the electric grid system, maximum harmonic current absorption by the harmonic power filter, minimum harmonic voltage distortion at the point of common coupling, and minimum current harmonic injected in the system and also in same time ensure a dynamically maximum current in the shunt power filter. Throughout the optimization process, all parameters of the power filter are being treated as continuous and discrete variables. The power filter design and optimization is performed over a specified set of discrete dominant offending harmonics. Since the optimal power filter parameters are dependent on the selected weighting factors, the weighting factors was also treated as dynamic optimizing parameters within the particle swarm optimization as a dual optimization and global selection of shunt power filters optimal parameters as well as best set of weighting factors.","doi":"10.1109/IDT.2009.5404376","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Design and Test Workshop (IDT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398724/5404079/05404376.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Design and Test Workshop (IDT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDT.2009.5404376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5404079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrete particle swarm optimization technique (DPSO) for power filter design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power filters","Power harmonic filters","Power system harmonics","Design optimization","Shunt (electrical)","Noise reduction","Absorption","Voltage","Harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power harmonic filters","power supply quality","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete particle swarm optimization technique","DPSO","power system shunt filter design","harmonic reduction","noise mitigation","electrical utility grid","multiobjective function","minimum harmonic current penetration","electric grid system","maximum harmonic current absorption","harmonic power filter","minimum harmonic voltage distortion","dynamic optimizing parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Harmonic filters","Power quality","Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A discrete particle swarm optimization technique (DPSO) for power filter design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404376/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105248","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discrete particle swarm optimization technique (DPSO) for power filter design","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"idt09submission036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059654S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398724","isNumber":"5404079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398724","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5404079","articleId":"5404376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5404377,"authors":[{"name":"Chengshi Zhao","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, School of Information and Communications Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5404377/5404377-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengshi Zhao (S'08) received the B.S. degree from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in July 2002 and the M.S. degree in communication and information systems from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in July 2006.

The problem becomes particularly difficult when the objective is to achieve maximum network capacity considering the mutual interference between the PUs and the SUs. In this paper, we specify the case with a single SU and multiple PUs, where both the SU and the PUs are orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated. The power allocation for the subcarriers of the SU is modeled into a constrained optimization problem, where the mutual interference between the SU and the PUs is comprehensively formulated as restrictions on the SU's transmission power. As a result, the proposed modeling scheme restrains the interference to the PUs, as well as maximizing the capacity of the SU. A novel iterative power-loading algorithm with low computational complexity is proposed to realize the power loading. On this basis, a suboptimal integral-bit-loading algorithm is further presented. In a simplified scenario, simulation results are exhibited to confirm the efficiency of the proposed power and bit-loading algorithms. Finally, the influence of the mutual interference on the SU's power/bit loading and the system capacity is illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2042091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05404377.pdf","startPage":"1910","endPage":"1922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2042091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power/Bit Loading in OFDM-Based Cognitive Networks With Comprehensive Interference Considerations: The Single-SU Case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404377/","displayDocTitle":"Power/Bit Loading in OFDM-Based Cognitive Networks With Comprehensive Interference Considerations: The Single-SU Case","volume":"59","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285994","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404377/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power/Bit Loading in OFDM-Based Cognitive Networks With Comprehensive Interference Considerations: The Single-SU Case","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhao-2042091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08355S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5404377","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5404378,"authors":[{"name":"Xingwen Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xingwen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310941800"},{"name":"Wensheng Yu","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wensheng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279841400"},{"name":"Long Wang","affiliation":["Center of Systems and Control, College of Engineering, and Key Laboratory of Machine Perception Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280759400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5404378","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":199,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1665},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Time varying systems","Delay systems","Asymptotic stability","Laboratories","Stability criteria","Lyapunov method","Educational programs","Automation","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","continuous time systems","delay systems","matrix algebra","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous-time positive system","time-varying delay","asymptotically stability","Hurwitz matrix","constant-delay positive system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","linear copositive Lyapunov functional","positive system","time-varying delays"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis for Continuous-Time Positive Systems With Time-Varying Delays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404378","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2041982","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5441194/05404378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2041982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441194","abstract":"This note addresses the stability problem of continuous-time positive systems with time-varying delays.

The cases for both the perfect channel-state information (CSI) and the estimated CSI are investigated. In the proposed MIMO-BICM scheme, the MIMO detector and the channel estimator utilize the soft information passed from the sliding-window convolutional decoder within the same iteration, and hence, the convergence speed can be increased. Compared with the conventional scheme using various interleaver designs, the proposed scheme not only achieves better error performance for the first iteration but also has lower decoding latency.

This is because, the rain rate estimated using measured drop size distribution shows that the contributions of lower drop diameters are small as compared to the central drop diameters. This is expected since the sensitivity of the Joss distrometer degrades for small drop diameters. The lower drop diameters are therefore removed from the drop size data and the gamma model is redesigned for its moments. The effects of the removal of a particular rain drop size diameter on the specific rain attenuation (in dB) and the slant-path rain attenuation calculations with forward scattering coefficients for vertical polarization are analyzed at Ku-band, Ka-band and Q-band frequencies. It is concluded that the sensitivity of the Joss distrometer although affects the rain rate estimation at low rain rates, does not affect the slant path rain attenuation on microwave links. Therefore, the small drop diameters can be ignored completely for slant path rain attenuation calculations in the tropical region of Singapore.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05404387.pdf","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1335","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2042027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2042027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truncated Gamma Drop Size Distribution Models for Rain Attenuation in Singapore","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Truncated Gamma Drop Size Distribution Models for Rain Attenuation in Singapore","htmlLink":"/document/5404387/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11220579","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truncated Gamma Drop Size Distribution Models for Rain Attenuation in Singapore","sourcePdf":"tap-lkumar-2042027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075287S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5404387","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5404390,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongding Lei","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5404390/5404390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongding (Zander) Lei (M\u201901\u2013SM\u201904) received the B.S.

After that, a suboptimal test is proposed to resolve the interference/noise uncertainty problems met for many detection algorithms such as the energy detection in practice. The theoretical FAR and PD are derived, and the theoretical threshold for any given FAR according to Neyman-Pearson criterion is accordingly given.

By obtaining the effective specific permeance of the machine from simple experimental measurements and the exact geometry of the rotor pole arc, a model is developed that includes the exact distribution of windings and operating-point-dependent saturation. This model offers a superior simulated response of the machine for fault transients, as well as for steady-state harmonic behavior, and is suitable for the closed-loop testing of relays and controls. The inductances of the machine are computed using the modified winding function approach and validated using finite-element analysis. Finally, the performance of the model is validated under healthy and faulted conditions by comparison with tests on an actual machine.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5416618/05404394.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2038530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2038530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Synchronous Machine Model for a Real-Time Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous machines","Power system simulation","Power system transients","Machine windings","Computational modeling","Testing","Transient analysis","Power system harmonics","Digital relays","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","finite element analysis","machine theory","machine windings","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comprehensive synchronous machine model","real-time environment","salient-pole synchronous machine","rotor pole arc","winding distribution","operating-point-dependent saturation","fault transients","steady-state harmonic behavior","closed-loop testing","relays","modified winding function approach","finite-element analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross magnetization","digital transient network analyzer (DTNA)","finite-element analysis","real-time simulation","saturation","synchronous machine","winding function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Synchronous Machine Model for a Real-Time Environment","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5404394/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138245","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Synchronous Machine Model for a Real-Time Environment","sourcePdf":"tec-dehkordi-2038530.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082488S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5416618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5416618","articleId":"5404394","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5404395,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5404395/5404395-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yifei Wei received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Lecturer with the School of Electronic Engineering, BUPT.

Most previous works for relay selection use the current observed channel conditions to make the relay-selection decision for the subsequent frame. However, this \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">memoryless</i>\n channel assumption is often not realistic given the time-varying nature of some mobile environments. In this paper, we consider finite-state Markov channels in the relay-selection problem. Moreover, we also incorporate adaptive modulation and coding, as well as residual relay energy in the relay-selection process. The objectives of the proposed scheme are to increase spectral efficiency, mitigate error propagation, and maximize the network lifetime. The formulation of the proposed relay-selection scheme is based on recent advances in stochastic control algorithms. The obtained relay-selection policy has an indexability property that dramatically reduces the computation and implementation complexity. In addition, there is no need for a centralized control point in the network, and relays can freely join and leave from the set of potential relays. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2041803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05404395.pdf","startPage":"2149","endPage":"2158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2041803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Optimal Relay Selection in Wireless Cooperative Networks With Finite-State Markov Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404395/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Optimal Relay Selection in Wireless Cooperative Networks With Finite-State Markov Channels","volume":"59","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2010","accessionNumber":"11392360","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404395/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Optimal Relay Selection in Wireless Cooperative Networks With Finite-State Markov Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2041803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070631S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5404395","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5404399,"authors":[{"name":"Changqing Luo","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5404399/5404399-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changqing Luo received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

Most previous works in CR networks ignore the TCP performance. In this paper, we take a cross-layer design approach to jointly consider the spectrum sensing, access decision, physical-layer modulation and coding scheme, and data-link layer frame size in CR networks to maximize the TCP throughput in CR networks. The wireless channel and the primary network usage are modeled as a finite-state Markov process. Due to the miss detection and the estimation error experienced by secondary users, the system state cannot be directly observed. Consequently, we formulate the cross-layer TCP throughput optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Simulation results show that the design parameters in CR networks have a significant impact on the TCP throughput, and the TCP throughput can be substantially improved if the low-layer parameters in CR networks are optimized jointly.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2041802","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05404399.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2041802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"2485","endPage":"2495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Design for TCP Performance Improvement in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Design for TCP Performance Improvement in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404399/","volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5404399/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2010","accessionNumber":"11392350","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Design for TCP Performance Improvement in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2041802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089349S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5404399","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5404400,"authors":[{"name":"Jefferson L.

Further enhancements in data rate are achieved by combining loaded OFDM with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmission. Motivated by the lack of appropriate error-rate analysis techniques for this popular type of transmission system, in this paper, we develop a novel analytical method for bit-error-rate (BER) and frame-error-rate (FER) estimation of bit-loaded coded OFDM and MIMO-OFDM systems using singular value decomposition (SVD), operating over frequency-selective quasi-static channels with nonideal interleaving. Then, we introduce three different applications of the proposed analysis. First, we compare the performance of several OFDM bit-loading schemes and propose a hybrid loading scheme that selects the best loading for each channel realization from a number of candidates. Second, we introduce three adaptive interleaving schemes: 1) selecting the best interleaver from a number of predefined interleavers; 2) a novel adaptive bit-interleaving algorithm based on the pairwise error probability; and 3) a spatial interleaving scheme for MIMO-OFDM-SVD systems with separate information sources. Third, we introduce an adaptive coded-modulation algorithm by using our BER and FER estimation techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05404412.pdf","startPage":"2340","endPage":"2351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2041804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2041804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Rate Analysis for Bit-Loaded Coded MIMO-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","OFDM","Interleaved codes","MIMO","Bit error rate","Frequency estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Convolutional codes","Frequency-selective fading channels","Singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","channel coding","convolutional codes","error statistics","fading channels","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error-rate analysis","bit-loaded coded MIMO-OFDM","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","convolutional coding","quasistatic frequency-selective fading channels","multiple-input-multiple-output","bit-error-rate","BER","frame-error-rate","FER estimation","singular value decomposition","SVD","frequency-selective quasistatic channels","adaptive coded-modulation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive interleaving","bit loading","coding","error-rate analysis","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Error-Rate Analysis for Bit-Loaded Coded MIMO-OFDM","volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5404412/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2010","accessionNumber":"11392316","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Rate Analysis for Bit-Loaded Coded MIMO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"tvt-lampe-2041804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079129S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5404412","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5404421,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Woo Han","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5419130/5404421/5404421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Woo Han received the B.S. degree in 2004 from Inha University, Incheon, Korea, and the M.S. degree in 2006 from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.","His research interests include multiple-gate MOSFET, novel device, and nanofabrication technology, and his research covered a broad area in silicon devices ranging from device design to process development, simulation, characterization, and modeling."]},"firstName":"Jin-Woo","lastName":"Han","id":"37290383700"},{"name":"Seong-Wan Ryu","affiliation":["Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5419130/5404421/5404421-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Seong-Wan Ryu received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently with Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Ichon, Korea.

In this design, the memory mode of URAM is selected according to user specifications. As the back-channel is assigned for capacitorless 1T-DRAM while the front-channel is devoted for Flash memory, spatial separation minimizes undesired soft programming in the front O/N/O layer and allows for capacitorless 1T-DRAM operation irrespective of the data state of the nonvolatile memory. This feature presents interference-free operation between the two modes. In addition, the virtue of the TFT process allows the potential for stackable memory for ultra-high-density era.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2038584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2038584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5419130/05404421.pdf","startPage":"601","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polysilicon Channel TFT With Separated Double-Gate for Unified RAM (URAM)\u2014Unified Function for Nonvolatile SONOS Flash and High-Speed Capacitorless 1T-DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Polysilicon Channel TFT With Separated Double-Gate for Unified RAM (URAM)\u2014Unified Function for Nonvolatile SONOS Flash and High-Speed Capacitorless 1T-DRAM","volume":"57","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5404421/","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142371","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404421/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polysilicon Channel TFT With Separated Double-Gate for Unified RAM (URAM)\u2014Unified Function for Nonvolatile SONOS Flash and High-Speed Capacitorless 1T-DRAM","sourcePdf":"ted-choi-2038584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077599S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5419130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5419130","articleId":"5404421","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5404427,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Geir Whist Tvedt","affiliation":["Institute of Microsystem Technology, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Vestfold University College, Horten, Norway","Department of Microsystems and Nanotechnology, Norwegian Institute of Technology, Oslo, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5441232/5404427/5404427-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lars Geir Whist Tvedt received the M.S. degree in microsystem technology from the Institute for Microsystem Technology, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Vestfold University College, Horten, Norway, in 2008.","Since August 2008, he has been a Research Scientist in the Department of Microsystems and Nanotechnology, The Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, Information and Communication Technology, Oslo, Norway.

Unlike the WFS formulation, the presented approach does not employ a far-field approximation when linear secondary source distributions are considered but provides exact results.

Our framework is general in that this value can represent a consensus value among multiple agents or an optimal solution of an optimization problem, where the global objective function is a combination of local agent objective functions. Our main focus is on constrained problems where the estimates of each agent are restricted to lie in different convex sets. To highlight the effects of constraints, we first consider a constrained consensus problem and present a distributed \"projected consensus algorithm\" in which agents combine their local averaging operation with projection on their individual constraint sets. This algorithm can be viewed as a version of an alternating projection method with weights that are varying over time and across agents. We establish convergence and convergence rate results for the projected consensus algorithm. We next study a constrained optimization problem for optimizing the sum of local objective functions of the agents subject to the intersection of their local constraint sets. We present a distributed \"projected subgradient algorithm\" which involves each agent performing a local averaging operation, taking a subgradient step to minimize its own objective function, and projecting on its constraint set. We show that, with an appropriately selected stepsize rule, the agent estimates generated by this algorithm converge to the same optimal solution for the cases when the weights are constant and equal, and when the weights are time-varying but all agents have the same constraint set.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2041686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2041686","startPage":"922","endPage":"938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5441194/05404774.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Consensus and Optimization in Multi-Agent Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Consensus and Optimization in Multi-Agent Networks","volume":"55","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208161","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5404774/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Consensus and Optimization in Multi-Agent Networks","sourcePdf":"55tac04-aozdaglar-2041686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131355S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5441194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"1095","xplore-issue":"5441194","articleId":"5404774","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5404792,"authors":[{"name":"Ian J.

The MMI coupler uses a strongly-guiding deep-etched InP platform and the modal analysis of this strongly-guiding deep-etched InP waveguide gives the cross section of the single-mode nanophotonic waveguide, the geometry of the multimode interference region, and the etched-depth requirement. An efficient global optimizer combining parallel PSO algorithm and parallel FDTD is developed, which speedups the optimization and enables automatic nanophotonic design. Two 2 \u00d7 2 multimode interference couplers with a respective coupling ratio of 50%:50% and 90%:10% are designed as numerical examples using the global optimizer developed and the optimization result shows a ultra-compact multimode interference coupler with a length of ~10 \u00bfm can be achieved with a low excess loss, which is numerically verified by a parallel three-dimensional FDTD.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2040582","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1304","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

The proposed technique uses principal component analysis to identify the dominant pattern of the signals preprocessed by wavelet transform. The proposed protection algorithm presents a discriminating method based on the polarity, magnitude, and time interval between the detected traveling waves at the relay location. A supplemental algorithm consisting of a high-set overcurrent relay as well as an impedance-based relay is also proposed. This is done to overcome the well-known shortcomings of traveling-wave-based protection techniques for the detection of very close-in faults and single-phase-to-ground faults occurring at small voltage magnitudes. The proposed technique is evaluated for the protection of a two-terminal transmission line. Extensive simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC software indicate that the proposed approach is reliable for rapid and correct identification of various fault cases. It identifies most of the internal faults very rapidly in less than 2 ms. In addition, the proposed technique presents high noise immunity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5437451/05404978.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2037819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2037819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5404978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Traveling-Wave-Based Protection Technique Using Wavelet/PCA Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Wavelet analysis","Principal component analysis","Protective relaying","Power transmission lines","Fault diagnosis","Signal processing","Wavelet transforms","Impedance","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","overcurrent protection","power transmission faults","power transmission lines","power transmission protection","principal component analysis","relay protection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traveling-wave-based protection technique","wavelet-PCA analysis","power transmission line protection","principal component analysis","wavelet transform","high-set overcurrent relay","impedance-based relay","close-in fault detection","single-phase-to-ground faults","two-terminal transmission line","PSCAD-EMTDC software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex wavelet transform","principal component analysis (PCA)","transmission-line protection","traveling waves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Traveling-Wave-Based Protection Technique Using Wavelet/PCA Analysis","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5404978/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204430","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Traveling-Wave-Based Protection Technique Using Wavelet/PCA Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-msanaye-pasand-2037819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06921S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5437451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"5437451","articleId":"5404978","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5404981,"authors":[{"name":"Nina Mahmoudian","affiliation":["Department of AeroSpace and Ocean Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/5410041/5404981/5404981-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nina Mahmoudian received the B.A.E degree from Tehran Polytechnic, Tehran, Iran, in 1999 and the Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering from Virginia Polytechnic and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, in 2009.","She is a postdoctoral associate with vessel dynamics group in Virginia Tech's Aerospace and Ocean Engineering Department.

Underwater gliders are winged underwater vehicles which locomote by modulating their buoyancy and their attitude. Several underwater gliders have been developed and have proven their worth as efficient long-distance, long-duration ocean sampling platforms. Underwater gliders are so efficient because they spend much of their flight time in stable, steady motion. Wings-level gliding flight for underwater gliders has been well studied, but analysis of steady turning flight is more subtle. This paper presents an approximate analytical expression for steady turning motion for a realistic underwater glider model. The problem is formulated in terms of regular perturbation theory, with the vehicle turn rate as the perturbation parameter. The resulting solution exhibits a special structure that suggests an efficient approach to motion control as well as a planning strategy for energy efficient paths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5404981/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","volume":"35","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105761","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5404981/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Approximate Analytical Turning Conditions for Underwater Gliders: Implications for Motion Control and Path Planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Analytical Turning Conditions for Underwater Gliders: Implications for Motion Control and Path Planning","sourcePdf":"joe-cwoolsey-2039655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075293S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5410041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5410041","articleId":"5404981","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5404984,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel F.

This is motivated by the fact that it is common in remotely controlled systems that measurement and control signals are shared over a single digital network.

Our idea consists in a circuit design in which low voltages are applied to memristors during their operation as analog circuit elements and high voltages are used to program the memristor's states. This way, as it was demonstrated in recent experiments, the state of memristors does not essentially change during analog mode operation. As an example of our approach, we have built several programmable analog circuits demonstrating memristor-based programming of threshold, gain and frequency. In these circuits the role of memristor is played by a memristor emulator developed by us.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","volume":"57","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11464078","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5405039/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Practical Approach to Programmable Analog Circuits With Memristors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Approach to Programmable Analog Circuits With Memristors","sourcePdf":"57tcsi09-ypershin-2038539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118593S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5545511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"398","xplore-issue":"5545511","articleId":"5405039","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5405041,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco J.

Therefore, instead of the offline backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) algorithm, a standard online (real-time) backpropagation (BP) algorithm, usually called Elman BP (EBP), can be applied for EN training for discrete-time sequence predictions. However, the standard BP training algorithm is not the most suitable for ENs. A low learning rate can improve the training of ENs but can also result in very slow convergence speeds and poor generalization performance, whereas a high learning rate can lead to unstable training in terms of weight divergence. Therefore, an optimal or suboptimal tradeoff between training speed and weight convergence with good generalization capability is desired for ENs. This paper develops a robust extended EBP (eEBP) training algorithm for ENs with a new adaptive dead zone scheme based on eEBP training concepts. The adaptive learning rate and adaptive dead zone optimize the training of ENs for each individual output and improve the generalization performance of the eEBP training. In particular, for the proposed eEBP training algorithm, convergence of the ENs' weights with the adaptive dead zone estimates is proven in the sense of Lyapunov functions. Computer simulations are carried out to demonstrate the improved performance of eEBP for discrete-time sequence predictions.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2039226","startPage":"463","endPage":"480","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5420315/05405091.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2039226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Weight Convergence of Elman Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Backpropagation algorithms","Neurofeedback","Output feedback","Algorithm design and analysis","Recurrent neural networks","MIMO","Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","backpropagation","convergence","feedforward neural nets","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","Lyapunov methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weight convergence","Elman network","feedforward neural network","context layer","backpropagation through time algorithm","discrete time sequence prediction","weight divergence","adaptive learning rate","adaptive dead zone","Lyapunov function","extended Elman backpropagation training","generalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elman networks (ENs)","extended Elman backpropagation (eEBP) training","generalization","weight convergence"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adaptation, Physiological","Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Generalization (Psychology)","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Predictive Value of Tests","Time Factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Weight Convergence of Elman Networks","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5405091/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11151940","pubMedId":"20129857","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Weight Convergence of Elman Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-qsong-2039226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088481S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5420315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5420315","articleId":"5405091","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":5405093,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The control designs are complicated by the fact that the control input is multiplied by an uncertain, non-square matrix. A robust control design is presented first, in which partial knowledge of the aircraft model along with constant feedforward estimates of the unknown input parameters are used with a robust control term to stabilize the system. Motivated by the desire to reduce the need for high-gain feedback, an adaptive extension is then presented, in which feedforward adaptive estimates of the input uncertainty are used. These results show how asymptotic tracking control can be achieved for a nonlinear system in the presence of a non-square input matrix containing parametric uncertainty and nonlinear, non-LP disturbances. Asymptotic output tracking is proven via Lyapunov stability analysis, and high-fidelity simulation results are provided to verify the efficacy of the proposed controllers.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2039572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5599554/05405093.pdf","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2039572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Tracking for Aircraft via Robust and Adaptive Dynamic Inversion Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5405093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405093/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Tracking for Aircraft via Robust and Adaptive Dynamic Inversion Methods","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11612431","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5405093/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Tracking for Aircraft via Robust and Adaptive Dynamic Inversion Methods","sourcePdf":"tcst-wmackunis-2039572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086162S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5599554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5599554","articleId":"5405093","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5405099,"authors":[{"name":"Marina Antoniou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5419130/5405099/5405099-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marina Antoniou received the B.A. degree and the M.Eng. degree in electrical and information engineering in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in 2009 from the University of Cambridge, Trinity College, Cambridge, U.K. The topic of her Ph.D. was on the analysis of ultrafast power semiconductor switches.","She is currently with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cambridge.

The SJ IGBT is a new device that breaks the IGBT limits, i.e., it delivers performance that is dramatically better. More specifically, we demonstrate here that the optimized SJ IGBT can deliver turn-off losses that are at least 50% lower than those of the state-of-art IGBT while maintaining a similarly low on-state performance, both at room temperature and at higher temperatures. The presence of alternating p- and n-pillars in the drift region gives rise to unique characteristics that when optimized can deliver superior performance. This paper also presents a SPICE model of the SJ IGBT under optimized conditions. Its results are in good agreement with the DESSIS simulation results under direct current conditions. This model consists of an intrinsic MOSFET and a parallel combination of wide- and narrow-base p-n-p bipolar junction transistors.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2039260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419130","startPage":"594","endPage":"600","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5419130/05405099.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2039260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Superjunction Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor Optimization and Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Doping","Semiconductor process modeling","Anodes","MOSFET circuits","Transistors","Junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","insulated gate bipolar transistors","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superjunction insulated gate bipolar transistor optimization","SJ IGBT","SPICE model","DESSIS simulation","MOSFET","narrow-base p-n-p bipolar junction transistors","widebase p-n-p bipolar junction transistors","temperature 293 K to 298 K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field stop (FS) insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)","SPICE modeling","superjunction (SJ)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"The Superjunction Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor Optimization and Modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5405099/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11142382","publicationDate":"March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Superjunction Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor Optimization and Modeling","sourcePdf":"ted-antoniou-2039260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054058S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5419130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5419130","articleId":"5405099","onlineDate":"02 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5405103,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The noise leakage is worse in the continuous-time (CT) implementation due to the poorly controlled time constant of the analog loop filter. A parameter-based continuous-time to discrete-time transform is developed to get an exact digital NCF, and the analog filter time constant is calibrated to match with the digital NCF. A binary pulse tone is injected into the quantizer to detect the filter time-constant error, and eliminated by zero-forcing its residual power based on the adaptive least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm.

The proposed chip can support up to 8 \u00d7 8 64-QAM spatial multiplexing MIMO communications, which surpasses all reported MIMO detector ICs in antenna number and modulation order. Moreover, this chip provides configurable antenna number from 2 \u00d7 2 up to 8 \u00d7 8 and modulation order from QPSK to 64-QAM. Its outputs include bit-wise log likelihood ratios (LLRs) and a candidate list, making it compatible with powerful soft-input channel decoders and iterative decoding system. The MIMO detector adopts a novel sphere decoding algorithm with high decoding efficiency and superior error rate performance, called modified best-first with fast descent (MBF-FD).

Hence, the transient response of the LDO is significantly enhanced due to the improvement of the slew rate at the gate of the power transistor.

Therefore, researchers have considered subthreshold logic as a promising option to achieve ultra low energy dissipation. However, circuit propagation delay is extremely sensitive to PVT variations under subthreshold operation. Hence, large delay margin is required for successful operation of conventional synchronous designs. Since leakage energy contributes to a substantial portion of total energy dissipation in subthreshold operation, the leakage energy dissipated for the required delay margin degrades energy efficiency significantly. In addition, even small intra-die variations result in large clock skew and hence, it is difficult to efficiently handle timing issues such as the setup and the hold time violations. In this work, we explore asynchronous design approach to address these challenges in subthreshold operation. We employ critical-path replica to generate completion signals of combinational logic blocks and use classical four-phase handshaking for communication between pipeline flip-flops. Since the proposed design approach uses only local clock buffers, it is easier to handle timing problems compared to synchronous designs. We compared iso-yield minimum energy dissipation of two design approaches (synchronous and asynchronous) in an inverter chain. Despite leakage overhead due to pad delay of critical-path delay line and ?return-to-zero? time of four-phase handshaking, the proposed asynchronous design shows 71% energy savings compared to its synchronous counterpart. To demonstrate subthreshold operation of the proposed design approach, we fabricated an 8-tap FIR filter in 90 nm CMOS. Measured oscilloscope plots of handshaking and output bus signals show that the design operates successfully below 300 mV. We also measured energy consumption of the FIR filter from 19 test chips-the average was 4.64 pJ and the standard deviation was 0.3526 pJ.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2036764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5405130/05405151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2036764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405130","startPage":"401","endPage":"410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Asynchronous Design Techniques for Process-Tolerant and Energy-Efficient Subthreshold Operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5405151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Asynchronous Design Techniques for Process-Tolerant and Energy-Efficient Subthreshold Operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11137477","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5405151/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Asynchronous Design Techniques for Process-Tolerant and Energy-Efficient Subthreshold Operation","sourcePdf":"45jssc02-ichang-2036764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056149S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5405130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5405130","articleId":"5405151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5405152,"authors":[{"name":"Erick O.

Second, two techniques for the high-speed add-compare-select (ACS) circuits are given to lessen area overhead of the SISO decoder. Third, a modification of the processing schedule is made for higher operating efficiency. Two designs with parallel architecture have been implemented. The first design with 32 SISO decoders, each of which processes 2 symbols per cycle, has 160 Mb/s and 0.22 nJ/b/iter after measurement.

The ideal line termination impedances for a flat transfer function with linear phase (pure delay) are derived, using an s-parameter wire-pair model. It is shown that a driver with series capacitance on the one hand and a resistive load on the other, are fair approximations of these ideal terminations in the frequency range of interest. From a perspective of power efficiency, a capacitive driver is preferred, as the series capacitance reduces the voltage swing along the line which reduces dynamic power consumption. To reduce cross-talk and maintain data integrity, parallel differential interconnects with alternatingly one or two twists are used. In combination with a low offset dynamic sense amplifier at the receiver, and a low-power decision feedback equalization technique with analog feedback, gigabit communication is demonstrated at very low power consumption. A point-to-point link on a 90 nm CMOS test chip achieves 2 Gb/s over 10 mm long interconnects, while consuming 0.28 pJ/bit corresponding to 28 fJ/bit/mm, which is much lower than competing designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Efficient Gigabit Communication Over Capacitively Driven RC-Limited On-Chip Interconnects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2036761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5405130/05405156.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2036761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405130","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5405156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Power Efficient Gigabit Communication Over Capacitively Driven RC-Limited On-Chip Interconnects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5405156/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11118342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Efficient Gigabit Communication Over Capacitively Driven RC-Limited On-Chip Interconnects","sourcePdf":"jssc-mensink-2036761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113405S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5405130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5405130","articleId":"5405156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5405161,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Lam","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Nelson Lam biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Lam","id":"37411886600"},{"name":"Bosco H.

The scheme reduces crosstalk by selectively transforming/swapping the I, Q components of the received symbols. The scheme's effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to the IF digitizer part of the receiver. In the IF digitizer the incoming IF (first IF) signal is mixed and then converted to two digital signals, the I and Q signals, both at a second IF. These digital signals are then fed into a post conversion block. In this block dynamic quadrant swapping is applied, which reduces the crosstalk. Using an IF digitizer that includes two separate mixers with two separate low pass sigma-delta modulators for I and Q paths, the scheme's effectiveness is tested. Both simulation results and measured results show a significant improvement in image rejection ratio and BER, when the scheme is applied. With a SNR of 10.8 dB, at a 160.16 MHz incoming IF, and with a data rate of 36 kbps, the scheme improves the measured BER from 4.2 \u00d7 10 to 1.4 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">- 3</sup>\n.

Coherent optical receivers using digital signal processing techniques can mitigate the fiber impairments in the optical transmission system, including the chromatic dispersion equalization with digital filters. In this paper, an adaptive finite impulse response filter employing normalized least mean square algorithm is developed for compensating the chromatic dispersion in a 112-Gbit/s polarization division multiplexed quadrature phase shift keying coherent communication system, which is established in the VPI simulation platform. The principle of the adaptive normalized least mean square algorithm for signal equalization is analyzed theoretically, and at the meanwhile, the taps number and the tap weights in the adaptive finite impulse response filter for compensating a certain fiber chromatic dispersion are also investigated by numerical simulation. The chromatic dispersion compensation performance of the adaptive filter is analyzed by evaluating the behavior of the bit-error-rate versus the optical signal-to-noise ratio, and the compensation results are also compared with other present digital filters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital compensation of chromatic dispersion in 112-Gbit/s PDM-QPSK system","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Communications and Photonics conference and Exhibition (ACP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Communications and Photonics conference and Exhibition (ACP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361200/5405166/05405375.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5405375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Digital compensation of chromatic dispersion in 112-Gbit/s PDM-QPSK system","conferenceDate":"2-6 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2009-Supplement","htmlLink":"/document/5405375/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital compensation of chromatic dispersion in 112-Gbit/s PDM-QPSK system","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"76329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063131S","chronDate":"2-6 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361200","isNumber":"5405166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361200","xplore-issue":"5405166","articleId":"5405375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"OSA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5405383,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It is found that the compressed spectral width is strongly dependent on the initial peak power and propagation length of the incident pulse. A compression factor up to 7 can be achieved. With the PCF, efficient spectral compression can take place in the wavelength range of 1530 \u223c 1570 nm covering the C-band.

Current standard measures, such as the relative area of emphysema (RA), rely on a single intensity threshold on individual pixels, thus ignoring any interrelations between pixels. Texture analysis allows for a much richer representation that also takes the local structure around pixels into account. This paper presents a texture classification-based system for emphysema quantification in CT images. Measures of emphysema severity are obtained by fusing pixel posterior probabilities output by a classifier. Local binary patterns (LBP) are used as texture features, and joint LBP and intensity histograms are used for characterizing regions of interest (ROIs). Classification is then performed using a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n nearest neighbor classifier with a histogram dissimilarity measure as distance. A 95.2% classification accuracy was achieved on a set of 168 manually annotated ROIs, comprising the three classes: normal tissue, centrilobular emphysema, and paraseptal emphysema. The measured emphysema severity was in good agreement with a pulmonary function test (PFT) achieving correlation coefficients of up to |\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i>\n| = 0.79 in 39 subjects. The results were compared to RA and to a Gaussian filter bank, and the texture-based measures correlated significantly better with PFT than did RA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

In this paper, we present an efficient method that converts sensor's raw data to readable patterns in order to classify their current activities and then compare these patterns with previously stored patterns to detect several abnormal patterns like wandering which is one of the early symptoms of dementia and so on. In this way, we digitalize human activities and can detect wandering and so can infer dementia through activity pattern matching. Here, we present a novel algorithm about activity digitalization using acceleration sensors as well as a wandering estimation algorithm in order to overcome limitations of existing models to detect/infer dementia.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405672/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11106689","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5405672/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dementia Wandering Detection and Activity Recognition Algorithm Using Tri-Axial Accelerometer Sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dementia Wandering Detection and Activity Recognition Algorithm Using Tri-Axial Accelerometer Sensors","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid990828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065717S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403363","isNumber":"5405666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403363","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5405666","articleId":"5405672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5405723,"authors":[{"name":"S.

With the replication scheme adopted to enhance reliability, we propose a novel scheduling scheme for the efficient execution of replicated jobs. Our proposed method is based on genetic algorithm.

Experimental results on 8 well-known benchmark problems show that LSPSO achieves better results than the standard PSO, PSO with Gaussian mutation and PSO with Cauchy mutation on majority of test problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5405910/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11119832","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5405910/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization using adaptive local search","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization using adaptive local search","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049489S","chronDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398726","isNumber":"5405767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398726","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5405767","articleId":"5405910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5405920,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37396189700"},{"name":"Xu Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Xu Liu","id":"37406557100"},{"name":"Bingyu Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Bingyu Liu","id":"37404914800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4690-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4692-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9598"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9601"}],"articleNumber":"5405920","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave imaging","Breast cancer","Cancer detection","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Boundary conditions","Glands","Breast neoplasms","Ultra wideband technology","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","finite difference time-domain analysis","image reconstruction","medical image processing","microwave imaging","tumours","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast cancer detection","FDTD","perfect matched layer absorption boundary condition","ultra-wideband microwave imaging","electromagnetic parameters","malignant tumor","breast tissues","tumor detection","2D breast model","finite difference time domain method","image reconstruction","signal processes","size 6 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","PML","Breast cancer detection","FDTD"]}],"abstract":"Ultra-wideband (UWB) microwave imaging is a very promising method for the early breast cancer detection physically based on the large contrast of electromagnetic parameters between the malignant tumor and the normal breast tissues.

The Perfect matched layer absorption boundary condition (PML ABC) is adopted in the computation. The influences from the skin, breast gland and the chest wall to the breast cancer detection by UWB imaging are investigated. The detection for an assumed 6 mm early stage tumor which located behind the gland is performed.

The problem can be further formulated by an energy function, called the CLM energy function, in the subspace of nonnegative orthant. The set of minimum points of the CLM energy function forms the set of solutions of the CLM problem. Solving the CLM problem means to find out such solutions. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be used to implement the CLM to solve the CLM problem. The key point is to make the set of minimum points of the CLM energy function just correspond to the set of stable attractors of the recurrent neural networks. This paper proposes to use Lotka-Volterra RNNs (LV RNNs) to implement the CLM. The contribution of this paper is to establish foundations of implementing the CLM by LV RNNs. The contribution mainly contains three parts. The first part is on the CLM energy function. Necessary and sufficient conditions for minimum points of the CLM energy function are established by detailed study. The second part is on the convergence of the proposed model of the LV RNNs. It is proven that interesting trajectories are convergent. The third part is the most important. It proves that the set of stable attractors of the proposed LV RNN just equals the set of minimum points of the CLM energy function in the nonnegative orthant. Thus, the LV RNNs can be used to solve the problem of the CLM. It is believed that by establishing such basic rigorous theories, more and interesting applications of the CLM can be found.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2039758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5420315/05406009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2039758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420315","startPage":"494","endPage":"507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foundations of Implementing the Competitive Layer Model by Lotka\u2013Volterra Recurrent Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Foundations of Implementing the Competitive Layer Model by Lotka\u2013Volterra Recurrent Neural Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11151938","pubMedId":"20142165","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Foundations of Implementing the Competitive Layer Model by Lotka\u2013Volterra Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-zyi-2039758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039654S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"5420315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"45","articleId":"5406009","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406017,"authors":[{"name":"Afshin Izadian","affiliation":["Purdue School of Engineering and Technology, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN, USA","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Izadian","id":"38505545300"},{"name":"Parviz Famouri","affiliation":["Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Parviz","lastName":"Famouri","id":"37282911600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5406017","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":447},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of MEMS Lateral Comb Resonators Using Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimators","abstract":"In this brief a fault diagnostic unit is developed for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) by means of multiple model adaptive estimation technique.

Conventional design technique using a single machine infinite bus approximation involves the frequency response estimation called the GEP(s) between the AVR input and the resultant electrical torque. This requires the knowledge of equivalent external reactance and infinite bus voltage or their estimated values at each machine. Other design techniques using P-Vr characteristics or residues are based on complete system information. In the proposed method, information available at the high voltage bus of the step-up transformer is used to set up a modified Heffron-Phillip's model. With this model it is possible to decide the structure of the PSS compensator and tune its parameters at each machine in the multi-machine environment, using only those signals that are available at the generating station. The efficacy of the proposed design technique has been evaluated on three of the most widely used test systems. The simulation results have shown that the performance of the proposed stabilizer is comparable to that which could be obtained by conventional design but without the need for the estimation and computation of external system parameters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2036778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05406034.pdf","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1051","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2036778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power System Stabilizers Design for Interconnected Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Power System Stabilizers Design for Interconnected Power Systems","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5406034/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11256790","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Stabilizers Design for Interconnected Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ggurrala-2036778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055419S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5406034","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5406035,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Witte","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5512812/5406035/5406035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pascal Witte (S\u201903) received his Dipl.-Ing. degree with highest honors in electrical engineering at the University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany, in 2004.","He is a Research Assistant with the Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

The presented method involves a background correlation technique to determine static and dynamic device mismatches causing linear time-invariant errors of the unit cells, as well as a way to digitally correct a modulator's output. Simulations show that the method can be used to precisely estimate imperfections and improve non-ideal modulators up to their ideal resolution, independent from the chosen oversampling ratio or architecture. The method is defined mathematically and verified by simulations. Comparisons with a common dynamic element matching technique show its superior behavior especially for low oversampling ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2034232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5512812/05406035.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2034232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512812","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Background DAC Error Estimation Using a Pseudo Random Noise Based Correlation Technique for Sigma-Delta Analog-to-Digital Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Background DAC Error Estimation Using a Pseudo Random Noise Based Correlation Technique for Sigma-Delta Analog-to-Digital Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11416872","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5406035/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Background DAC Error Estimation Using a Pseudo Random Noise Based Correlation Technique for Sigma-Delta Analog-to-Digital Converters","sourcePdf":"57tcsi07-pwitte-2034232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074053S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5512812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5512812","articleId":"5406035","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406036,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Xu","affiliation":["Communication Technology Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Anyang, South Korea","Center of Advanced Broadcasting Technology and the Digital Transmission Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404862000"},{"name":"Sang-Jin Lee","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Broadcasting Technology and the Digital Transmission Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293444400"},{"name":"Woo-Seok Kang","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Broadcasting Technology and the Digital Transmission Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Seok","lastName":"Kang","id":"37404069200"},{"name":"Jong-Soo Seo","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Broadcasting Technology and the Digital Transmission Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Soo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292426500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5406036","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1394},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Unicast","Wireless networks","MIMO","Broadcast technology","Quality of service","Telecommunication traffic","Multicast algorithms","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radio networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","MIMO","wireless multicast systems","multiple input multiple output technologies","OFDMA","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multiple antenna","downlink capacity","QoS","quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive resource allocation","MIMO","multicast service","OFDM","water-filling"]}],"abstract":"Multiple antenna orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is a promising technique for the high downlink capacity in the next generation wireless systems, in which adaptive resource allocation would be an important research issue that can significantly improve the performance with guaranteed QoS for users.

C37.118. The Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has developed dynamic performance requirements for PMU filters as a means to guarantee better, uniform PMU response under dynamic conditions, such as power swings and changing harmonics. These have been endorsed by North American Synchrophasor Initiative (NASPI) for its wide-area monitoring infrastructure. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new framework for designing PMU filtering algorithms capable of meeting or exceeding the WECC/NASPI requirements, while achieving an optimum transient response time. To this end, an adaptive complex bandpass filter derived from the exponentially modulated filter bank theory has been devised. It is built from freely chosen low-pass filter prototypes that fulfill the WECC requirements. The static and dynamic performances of two specific schemes dedicated to control and monitoring with 4- and 7-cycle response-time, respectively, are ascertained under noisy waveforms and changing harmonics with system frequency varying from 40 to 80 Hz. The center-frequency adaptation approach is shown to be intrinsically superior to the frequency compensation scheme, especially under fast varying frequency and changing harmonics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11883312","htmlLink":"/document/5406051/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Phasor and Frequency-Tracking Schemes for Wide-Area Protection and Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Phasor and Frequency-Tracking Schemes for Wide-Area Protection and Control","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-ikamwa-2039152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141131S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5738430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5738430","articleId":"5406051","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":5406052,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Fuel Cell Center, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5504509/5406052/5406052-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong-Jong Wai (M'99\u2013SM'05) was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1974.

First, the dynamic model of a maglev transportation system including levitated electromagnets driven by linear servo amplifiers and a propulsive linear induction motor (LIM) based on the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics is developed. Then, a total sliding-mode (TS) control strategy is introduced, and the concept of TS control is incorporated into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form an on-line TSPSO control framework with varied inertial weights for preserving the robust control characteristics and reducing the chattering control phenomena of TS control. In this TSPSO control scheme, a PSO control system is utilized to be the major controller, and the stability can be indirectly ensured by the concept of TS control without strict constraint and detailed system knowledge. In order to further directly stabilize the system states around a predefined bound region and effectively accelerate the searching speed of the PSO control, a supervisory mechanism is embedded into the TSPSO control to constitute a supervisory TSPSO (STSPSO) control strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes for the maglev transportation system is verified by numerical simulations and experimental results, and the superiority of the STSPSO control scheme is indicated in comparison with the adaptive fuzzy neural network, PSO-based proportional-integral-differential, TS and TSPSO control strategies.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5504509/05406052.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Supervisory Control Design for Maglev Transportation System via Total Sliding-Mode Approach and Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2042228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5504509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2042228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"On-Line Supervisory Control Design for Maglev Transportation System via Total Sliding-Mode Approach and Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11402205","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5406052/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Line Supervisory Control Design for Maglev Transportation System via Total Sliding-Mode Approach and Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tac-wai-2042228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095009S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5504509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5504509","articleId":"5406052","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406054,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

The optimization is performed on the repositioning of these devices throughout the spatial domain. It is assumed that a network of mobile sensing and actuating devices is available to obtain measurements from the spatially distributed process and dispense control signals to the spatially distributed process. By taking advantage of the properties that the spatial operator that governs the process dynamics possesses, namely symmetry, coercivity and boundedness, a scheme for the guidance of a mobile actuator-plus-sensor network is developed and used for the performance enhancement of the spatial process. The class of systems is governed by diffusion PDEs equipped with actuators having a boxcar spatial distribution and a collocated sensing device that provides the spatially averaged state measurement over the range of the actuating device. Using Lyapunov stability arguments, a stable guidance scheme is provided for each of the mobile agents. Due to the specific structure of the closed loop system operator with time-varying input and output operators, the same guidance schemes are applicable to the dual problem of mobile sensors employed for enhancing the state estimation problem. Both a centralized state estimator with mobile sensors and a network of consensus distributed estimators are considered, since both filters can be shown to result in the specific algebraic structure of a symmetric spatial operator with collocated input and output operators. Extensive numerical simulations for a 1-D diffusion equation with two actuator/sensor agents, a 2-D diffusion equation with one collocated actuator/sensor agent plus a centralized filter for a 1-D diffusion equation are included to verify the effectiveness of a such a mobile actuator-plus-sensor network in suppressing the effects of spatially varying disturbances and enhancing the system's performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Parameter estimation","Distributed parameter systems","Actuators","Sensor systems","State estimation","Equations","Filters","Process control","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","closed loop systems","distributed parameter systems","distributed processing","Lyapunov methods","mobile agents","optimisation","stability","state estimation","time-varying systems","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile actuator","mobile sensor network","distributed parameter systems","optimization","spatially distributed process","dispense control signals","Lyapunov stability arguments","stable guidance scheme","mobile agents","closed loop system operator","time-varying input","time-varying output","state estimation problem","centralized state estimator","distributed estimators","symmetric spatial operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Centralized filters","distributed consensus filters","distributed parameter systems","mobile actuators","mobile sensors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2042229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5504509/05406054.pdf","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5504509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2042229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guidance of Mobile Actuator-Plus-Sensor Networks for Improved Control and Estimation of Distributed Parameter Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Guidance of Mobile Actuator-Plus-Sensor Networks for Improved Control and Estimation of Distributed Parameter Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406054/","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5406054/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11402209","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guidance of Mobile Actuator-Plus-Sensor Networks for Improved Control and Estimation of Distributed Parameter Systems","sourcePdf":"55tac06-mdemetriou-2042229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124863S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5504509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"5504509","articleId":"5406054","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5406055,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Tebaldini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5447593/5406055/5406055-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Tebaldini received the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently working with the SAR Research Group, Politecnico di Milano.

This technique is based on the idea of characterizing the Fourier spectrum of the multibaseline data as being constituted by two effective scattering centers displaced along the vertical direction, plus the associated decorrelation terms. As a result, SAR tomography will be formulated as the problem of detecting the number of scattering centers within the resolution cell, estimating the parameters that describe their spatial structure, and evaluating the associated backscattered powers. Parameter estimation is carried out through the covariance matching estimation technique, which provides an asymptotically optimal solution.

Accordingly, six different GMTI modes were implemented in the system PAMIR (phased-array multifunctional imaging radar) of the Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (Fraunhofer FHR) including three switching modes. An experiment was conducted using six cooperative vehicles following a predefined scenario to compare the GMTI performance and, in particular, the positioning accuracy of the different GMTI modes.

In LDA, the weights are updated by seeking directions that are efficient for discrimination. In GMM, parameter learning adopts the gradient-descent method to reduce the cost function. Since LDA-derived fuzzy rules increase the discriminative capability among different classes, the proposed MDSOFN can classify highly confusable patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MDSOFN is demonstrated by two classification problems. A detailed comparative performance analysis for the fuzzy networks using LDA, principal component analysis (PCA), and the support vector machine (SVM), with various noise types, is presented.

As is known to us, when PRF is less than the Doppler spectrum bandwidth, moving targets suffer both Doppler centroid frequency ambiguity and Doppler spectrum ambiguity. Under this condition, the traditional parameter estimation method in the Doppler domain is out of action. The key of this letter converts motion parameter estimation in the synthetic aperture radar system with low PRF sampling into solving an optimization equation based on CS theory. Because moving targets in the scene can be regarded as sparse signals after clutter cancellation, an optimization algorithm based on CS theory is proposed to reconstruct sparse signals and meanwhile estimate the along-track velocities and azimuth positions of moving targets. Considering the fact that range cell migration of moving targets is not subject to PRF limitations, Radon transform is adopted to obtain unambiguous across-track velocities and range positions. Results on simulation and real data are provided to show the effectiveness of this method.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2009.2039113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2009.2039113","startPage":"450","endPage":"454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5508674/05406073.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Parameter Estimation in the SAR System With Low PRF Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Motion Parameter Estimation in the SAR System With Low PRF Sampling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5406073/","accessionNumber":"11464687","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406073/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Parameter Estimation in the SAR System With Low PRF Sampling","sourcePdf":"lgrs-wu-2039113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056552S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5508674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5508674","articleId":"5406073","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":5406089,"authors":[{"name":"Boaz Nadler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Boaz Nadler was born in Israel in 1971.

We present three contributions on this subject. First, we derive a new expression for the detection performance of the MDL estimator, which exhibits a much closer fit to simulations in comparison to previous formulas. Second, we present a random matrix theory viewpoint of the performance of the AIC estimator, including approximate analytical formulas for its overestimation probability. Finally, we show that a small increase in the penalty term of AIC leads to an estimator with a very good detection performance and a negligible overestimation probability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05406089.pdf","startPage":"2746","endPage":"2756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2042481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2042481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric Detection of Signals by Information Theoretic Criteria: Performance Analysis and an Improved Estimator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Performance analysis","Sensor arrays","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrix","Signal analysis","Probability","Array signal processing","Computer science","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal nonparametric detection","information theoretic criteria","Akaike information criterion","minimum description length","random matrix theory","AIC estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information theoretic criteria","performance analysis","random matrix theory","source enumeration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric Detection of Signals by Information Theoretic Criteria: Performance Analysis and an Improved Estimator","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5406089/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11228746","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric Detection of Signals by Information Theoretic Criteria: Performance Analysis and an Improved Estimator","sourcePdf":"58tsp05-bnadler-2042481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110161S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5406089","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406091,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Xie","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5441232/5406091/5406091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin Xie received the B.Eng. degree in automotive engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000, the M.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2008.","Since 2007, he has been with the Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, where he is currently a Senior Research Engineer in the Sensors and Actuators Microsystems Program.

Selective harmonic elimination for the staircase voltage waveform generated by multilevel inverters has been studied extensively in the last decade. Most of the published methods on this topic were based on solving high-order multivariable polynomial equation groups derived from Fourier series expansion. This paper presents a different approach, which is based on equal area criteria and harmonic injection. With the proposed method, regardless of how many voltage levels are involved, only four simple equations are needed. The results of a case study with maximum of five switching angles show that the proposed method can be used to achieve excellent harmonic elimination performance for the modulation index range at least from 0.2 to 0.9. To demonstrate the adaptability of the proposed method for waveforms with a high number of switching angles, experimental results on a 1-MVA 6000-V 17-level cascade multilevel inverter are also shown at the end of this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2041620","startPage":"857","endPage":"865","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5433727/05406094.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2041620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5433727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Precise and Practical Harmonic Elimination Method for Multilevel Inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Voltage","Switching loss","Space vector pulse width modulation","Equations","Fourier series","Pulse inverters","Switches","Electronics industry","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier series","polynomials","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic elimination method","multilevel inverters","voltage waveform","Fourier series expansion","high-order multivariable polynomial equation","pulsewidth-modulation inverters","voltage 600 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equal area criteria","modulation index","multilevel inverters","pulsewidth modulation (PWM)","total harmonic distortion (THD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-april  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Precise and Practical Harmonic Elimination Method for Multilevel Inverters","volume":"46","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5406094/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-april 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11204106","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Precise and Practical Harmonic Elimination Method for Multilevel Inverters","sourcePdf":"tia-wang-2041620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06997S","chronDate":"March-april  2010","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5433727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5433727","articleId":"5406094","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5406095,"authors":[{"name":"Umesh Vaidya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5475457/5406095/5406095-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Umesh Vaidya (M'07) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from University of California at Santa Barbara in 2004.","He is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames.

Each node in the system is equipped with multiple antennas. The purpose of this study is to develop fast algorithms to compute the source covariance matrix (or matrices) and the relay transformation matrix to optimize a system performance. We consider the minimization of power consumption subject to rate constraint and also the maximization of system throughput subject to power constraint. These problems are nonconvex and apparently have no simple solutions. In this paper, a number of computational strategies are presented and their performances are investigated. Both uplink and downlink cases are considered. The use of multiple carriers is also discussed. Moreover, a generalized water-filling (GWF) algorithm is developed to solve a special class of convex optimization problems. The GWF algorithm is used for two of the strategies shown in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05406097.pdf","startPage":"2823","endPage":"2835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2042476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2042476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for a MIMO Relay System With Multiple-Antenna Users","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Power system relaying","Digital relays","Covariance matrix","System performance","Processor scheduling","Decoding","Energy consumption","Throughput","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","covariance matrices","MIMO communication","minimisation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","MIMO relay system","multiple-antenna users","scheduling problem","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output wireless relay system","access point","source covariance matrix","relay transformation matrix","power consumption minimization","nonconvex problem","multiple carriers","generalized water-filling algorithm","GWF algorithm","convex optimization problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convex optimization","generalized water filling","medium access control","multiuser MIMO relays","network of MIMO links","nonconvex optimization","space\u2013time power allocation","space\u2013time power scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for a MIMO Relay System With Multiple-Antenna Users","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5406097/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11228717","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation for a MIMO Relay System With Multiple-Antenna Users","sourcePdf":"58tsp05-yhua-2042476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089421S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5406097","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406102,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Hsin Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, IBM Thomas J.

Wavelet-based approaches using a recursive decomposition process are unsuitable for real-time ECG signal recoding and commonly obtain a nonlinear compression performance with distortion sensitive to quantization error. The sensitive response is caused without compromising the influences of word-length-growth (WLG) effect and unfavorable for the reconstruction quality control of ECG data compression. In this paper, the 1-D reversible round-off nonrecursive discrete periodic wavelet transform is applied to overcome the WLG magnification effect in terms of the mechanisms of error propagation resistance and significant normalization of octave coefficients. The two mechanisms enable the design of a multivariable quantization scheme that can obtain a compression performance with the approximate characteristics of linear distortion. The quantization scheme can be controlled with a single control variable. Based on the linear compression performance, a linear quantization scale prediction model is presented for guaranteeing reconstruction quality.

Motivated by the ability of the human auditory system to robustly analyze complex acoustic scenes, the associated peripheral stage is used in this paper as a front-end to estimate the azimuth of sound sources based on binaural signals. One classical approach to localize an acoustic source in the horizontal plane is to estimate the interaural time difference (ITD) between both ears by searching for the maximum in the cross-correlation function. Apart from ITDs, the interaural level difference (ILD) can contribute to localization, especially at higher frequencies where the wavelength becomes smaller than the diameter of the head, leading to ambiguous ITD information. The interdependency of ITD and ILD on azimuth is a complex pattern that depends also on the room acoustics, and is therefore learned by azimuth-dependent Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Multiconditional training is performed to take into account the variability of the binaural features which results from multiple sources and the effect of reverberation. The proposed localization model outperforms state-of-the-art localization techniques in simulated adverse acoustic conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5594819/05406118.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2042128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2042128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Model for Robust Localization Based on a Binaural Auditory Front-End","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Reverberation","Azimuth","Degradation","Humans","Auditory system","Signal analysis","Layout","Ear","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","correlation methods","estimation theory","Gaussian processes","probability","reverberation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic model","robust localization","binaural auditory front-end","machine-based localization","localization performance","human auditory system","associated peripheral stage","sound sources","acoustic source localisation","interaural time difference","cross-correlation function","interaural level difference","Gaussian mixture models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Localization","binaural","reverberation","auditory scene analysis (ASA)","interaural time difference (ITD)","interaural level difference (ILD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Model for Robust Localization Based on a Binaural Auditory Front-End","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5406118/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11561084","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Model for Robust Localization Based on a Binaural Auditory Front-End","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-tmay-2042128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105054S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5594819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5594819","articleId":"5406118","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406124,"authors":[{"name":"Kavita Burse","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Kavita","lastName":"Burse","id":"37697729000"},{"name":"R.

Then, the sliding-mode control problem is considered by designing an integral sliding surface function. An observer is designed to estimate the system states, and a sliding-mode control scheme is synthesized for the reaching motion based on the state estimates. It is shown that the sliding mode in the estimation space can be attained in a finite time. Some conditions for the stochastic admissibility of the overall closed-loop system are derived.

By prescribed performance we mean that the tracking error converges to a predefined arbitrarily small residual set, with convergence rate no less than a prespecified value, exhibiting maximum overshoot as well as undershoot less than some sufficiently small preassigned constants. Utilizing an output error transformation, we obtain a transformed system whose robust stabilization is proven necessary and sufficient to achieve prescribed performance guarantees for the output tracking error of the original system, provided that initially the transformed system is well defined. Consequently, a switching robust control Lyapunov function (RCLF)-based adaptive, state feedback controller is designed, to solve the stated problem. The proposed controller is continuous and successfully overcomes the problem of computing the control law when the approximation model becomes uncontrollable.

Spectral amplitudes are known to exhibit inter-frame dependencies and non-Gaussian statistics; however, incorporating these properties makes closed-form solutions intractable. Using the particle filter framework allows the presented algorithm to model the speech spectral amplitudes as an autoregressive process with Laplace distributed excitation. Two variants of the standard algorithm are also presented: one that uses an interacting multiple model approach to account for transitions between active speech and silence intervals, and one that allows for phase differences between the clean speech and noise complex Fourier transform coefficients. All of the particle sampling distributions are constrained to take the measurement into account, improving sampling efficiency. In experiments using wideband speech and real recorded noise the proposed algorithm variants are shown to offer natural-sounding output speech, with objective evaluation results that compare favorably to existing particle filter speech enhancement algorithms. The multiple model variant is found to improve inter-speech noise reduction, while the phase variant improves performance when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2042127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2042127","startPage":"2155","endPage":"2167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5559658/05406136.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Filter Enhancement of Speech Spectral Amplitudes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Particle Filter Enhancement of Speech Spectral Amplitudes","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","volume":"18","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5406136/","accessionNumber":"11513403","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406136/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Filter Enhancement of Speech Spectral Amplitudes","sourcePdf":"tasl-laska-2042127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074034S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5559658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5559658","articleId":"5406136","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5406140,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Gil","affiliation":["Communications Technology Group, Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5447585/5406140/5406140-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eduardo Gil was born in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1978.

The temporal evolution of time\u2013frequency PTTV parameters during DAP was analyzed. The results show an increase in the sympathetic activity index low-frequency component (LF) during DAP for PTTV (85%) significantly higher than for heart rate variability (HRV) (33%), (<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$p&lt; \\,$</tex></formula>10<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{-13}$</tex></formula>). However, decreases in parasympathetic activity produce lower decrements in high-frequency component (HF) indexes for PTTV (18%) than for HRV (22%). Thus, PTTV reflects sympathetic changes more clearly than HRV. A clinical study was carried out. DAP events were classified as apneic or nonapneic using a linear discriminant analysis from the PTTV indexes.

Instead of regularizing the compressed sensing inverse problem with a sparsity prior in a fixed basis, our framework makes use of sparsity in a tree-structured dictionary of orthogonal bases. A new iterative thresholding algorithm performs both the recovery of the signal and the estimation of the best basis. The resulting reconstruction from compressive measurements optimizes the basis to the structure of the sensed signal. Adaptivity is crucial to capture the regularity of complex natural signals. Numerical experiments on sounds and geometrical images indeed show that this best basis search improves the recovery with respect to fixed sparsity priors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05406148.pdf","startPage":"2613","endPage":"2622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2042490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2042490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Best Basis Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Dictionaries","Image coding","Wavelet packets","Iterative algorithms","Image reconstruction","Vectors","Tree data structures","Signal processing algorithms","Inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","iterative methods","signal reconstruction","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["best basis compressed sensing recovery","inverse problem","sparsity","tree structured dictionary","signal recovery","signal estimation","signal reconstruction","iterative thresholding algorithm","geometrical images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandlets","best basis","compressed sensing","cosine packets","sparsity","wavelet packets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Best Basis Compressed Sensing","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5406148/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11228740","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best Basis Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"58tsp05-gpeyre-2042490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121958S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5406148","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406149,"authors":[{"name":"Hang-Ting Lue","affiliation":["Emerging Central Laboratory, Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/5477199/5406149/5406149-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hang-Ting Lue was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1975.

In this paper, a new current feedback method for PR current control is proposed. The weighted average value of the currents flowing through the two inductors of the LCL filter is used as the feedback to the current PR regulator. Consequently, the control system with the LCL filter is degraded from a third-order function to a first-order one. A large proportional control-loop gain can be chosen to obtain a wide control-loop bandwidth, and the system can be optimized easily for minimum current harmonic distortions, as well as system stability. The inverter system with the proposed controller is investigated and compared with those using traditional control methods. Experimental results on a 5-kW fuel-cell inverter are provided, and the new current control strategy has been verified.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2040552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5463268/05406162.pdf","startPage":"2033","endPage":"2041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2040552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Feedback Method for PR Current Control of LCL-Filter-Based Grid-Connected Inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406162/","displayDocTitle":"A New Feedback Method for PR Current Control of LCL-Filter-Based Grid-Connected Inverter","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11286130","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5406162/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Feedback Method for PR Current Control of LCL-Filter-Based Grid-Connected Inverter","sourcePdf":"tie-shen-2040552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083061S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5463268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"332","xplore-issue":"5463268","articleId":"5406162","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5406166,"authors":[{"name":"Ehab E.

Accurately estimated forecasts are essential part of an efficient power system planning and operation. In this paper, a modified version of the support vector regression (SVR) is presented to solve the load forecasting problem. The proposed model is derived by modifying the risk function of the SVR algorithm with the use of locally weighted regression (LWR) while keeping the regularization term in its original form. In addition, the weighted distance algorithm based on the Mahalanobis distance for optimizing the weighting function's bandwidth is proposed to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The performance of the new model is evaluated with two real-world datasets, and compared with the local SVR and some published models using the same datasets. The results show that the proposed model exhibits superior performance compare to that of LWR, local SVR, and other published models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5484888/05406166.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2040176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2040176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Load Forecasting Based on Locally Weighted Support Vector Regression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Power system planning","Power system reliability","Neural networks","Support vector machines","Power system modeling","Power generation economics","Economic forecasting","Artificial intelligence","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","power engineering computing","power system planning","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric load forecasting","weighted support vector regression","electricity demand forecasting","SVR algorithm","locally weighted regression","power system planning","power system operation","support vector machine","SVM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load forecasting","locally weighted regression (LWR)","locally weighted support vector regression (LWSVR)","support vector regression (SVR)","time series reconstruction","weighted distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Electric Load Forecasting Based on Locally Weighted Support Vector Regression","volume":"40","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5406166/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11392203","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric Load Forecasting Based on Locally Weighted Support Vector Regression","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-elattar-2040176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088512S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5484888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"5484888","articleId":"5406166","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5406174,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan D.

The major problem of CMA, however, is that it only achieves moderate convergence rate and steady state mean square error (MSE). Furthermore, the CMA and such blind equalization techniques must rely on the observations of system outputs and some a priori statistical information of transmitted signals, so when they are used in some special fields such as military filed, electronic counter measures and many others, these blind equalization techniques cannot operate, because the priori statistical information of intercepted signals cannot be obtained. Consequently a parallel scheme for blind equalizer is proposed, which combines Modified Modulus Algorithm (MCMA) and Modified Decision Directed (MDD) algorithm. Compared with CMA, the proposed method can obtain faster convergence rate and lower MSE, and more important is that it can detect which order QAM signal is transmitted in the communication system.","doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406427","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398735/5406359/05406427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406359","startPage":"317","endPage":"320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel blind equalizer suitable for QAM signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel blind equalizer suitable for QAM signal","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406427/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136541","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5406427/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel blind equalizer suitable for QAM signal","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068217S","chronDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398735","isNumber":"5406359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398735","xplore-issue":"5406359","articleId":"5406427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5406434,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"lastName":"Haiyan Li","id":"37087299898"},{"name":"Yufeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405810900"},{"name":"Dan Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"lastName":"Dan Xu","id":"37087286575"},{"name":"Zhengyao Bai","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"lastName":"Zhengyao Bai","id":"37087159872"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4606-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5406434","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Speckle","Blood flow","Spectrogram","Matching pursuit algorithms","Neural networks","Ultrasonic imaging","Iterative methods","Iterative algorithms","Pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","blood flow measurement","Doppler measurement","iterative methods","matrix decomposition","medical signal processing","neural nets","signal denoising","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise reduction","speckle","Doppler blood flow spectrograms","matching pursuit","pulse coupled neural network","iterative decomposition algorithm","Doppler ultrasound signals","atom linear expansion","time-frequency dictionary","signal de-noising","firing matrix","PCNN firing matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler ultrasound","spectrograms","matching pursuit","pulse coupled neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406434","abstract":"To reduce noise and speckles in the spectrograms of Doppler blood flow signals, a novel method, called matching pursuit with pulse coupled neural network (MPPCNN), has been proposed.

Experimental studies on PSO-based spectral clustering algorithm demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides global convergence, steady performance and better accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406456","startPage":"211","endPage":"214","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398735/5406359/05406456.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-class spectral clustering based on particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Clustering algorithms","Convergence","Clustering methods","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Computational intelligence","Computer industry","Application software","Computer science","Videoconference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","linear algebra","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiclass spectral clustering","particle swarm optimization","computer vision","eigendecomposition","global optima","relaxed continuous domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","Spectral Clustering","Dimension Reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-class spectral clustering based on particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5406456/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136553","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-class spectral clustering based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053754S","chronDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398735","isNumber":"5406359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398735","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5406359","articleId":"5406456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5406459,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbai Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China","Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenbai Chen","id":"37087749543"},{"name":"Xiaopin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaopin Zhang","id":"37087926439"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["China Electronics Engineering Design Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Li","id":"37087925846"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4606-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5406459","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced complexity ML detection algorithm for V-BLAST architectures","abstract":"Vertical Bell-laboratories Space-Time (V-BLAST) is a multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas (MIMO) wireless systems. V-BLAST attains very high spectral efficiency while maintaining low implementation complexity. Among the detection algorithms of V-BLAST, Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection scheme performs the best, and however, its complexity is excessively high. To solve the problem, a reduced complexity ML detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. This scheme takes advantage of OSIC detection algorithm to reduce the number of constellation point in ML detection. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the computational complexity greatly and achieves high detection performance which is close to ML detection.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398735/5406359/05406459.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406459","doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406459","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","MIMO","Maximum likelihood detection","Computational complexity","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Computational modeling","Interference cancellation","Iterative algorithms","Antenna accessories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","spectral analysis","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["V-BLAST architecture","vertical bell-laboratories space-time","multiple transmit antenna","multiple receive antenna","MIMO wireless system","spectral efficiency","maximum likelihood detection scheme","OSIC detection algorithm","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO system","V-BLAST","ML detection","OSIC detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406459/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced complexity ML detection algorithm for V-BLAST architectures","accessionNumber":"11136556","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5406459/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","volume":"1","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced complexity ML detection algorithm for V-BLAST architectures","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063259S","chronDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398735","isNumber":"5406359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398735","xplore-issue":"5406359","articleId":"5406459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5406461,"authors":[{"name":"Prisadarng Skolpadungket","affiliation":["AI Research Group, University of Bradford, Bradford, Great Britain, UK"],"firstName":"Prisadarng","lastName":"Skolpadungket","id":"37396252700"},{"name":"Keshav Dahal","affiliation":["AI Research Group, University of Bradford, Bradford, Great Britain, UK"],"lastName":"Keshav Dahal","id":"37087154708"},{"name":"Napat Harnpornchai","affiliation":["CAMT, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand"],"firstName":"Napat","lastName":"Harnpornchai","id":"37831844000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4606-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5406461","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Input variables","Genetic algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Linear regression","Economic forecasting","Power generation economics","Evolutionary computation","Polynomials","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stock returns forecasting","variable selections","genetic algorithm","artificial neural networks","linear functional relationship","nonlinear functional relationship","Weierstrass theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Weierstrass Theorem","Genetic Algorithms","Artificial Neural Networks","Stock Return Forecasting","Cross Validation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406461","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398735/5406359/05406461.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","startPage":"186","endPage":"189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting stock returns using variable selections with Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural-Networks","abstract":"Modeling stock returns requires selections of appropriate input variables.

We have obtained new formulations for the fault detection of SubBytes and inverse SubBytes using the relation between the input and the output of the S-box and the inverse S-box. The proposed schemes are independent of the way the S-box and the inverse S-box are constructed. Therefore, they can be used for both the S-boxes and the inverse S-boxes using lookup tables and those utilizing logic gates based on composite fields. Our simulation results show the error coverage of greater than 99 percent for the proposed schemes. Moreover, the proposed and the previously reported fault detection schemes have been implemented on the most recent Xilinx Virtex FPGAs. Their area and delay overheads have been compared and it is shown that the proposed schemes outperform the previously reported ones.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5437556/05406504.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent Structure-Independent Fault Detection Schemes for the Advanced Encryption Standard","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Structure-Independent Fault Detection Schemes for the Advanced Encryption Standard","volume":"59","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11206182","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5406504/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Structure-Independent Fault Detection Schemes for the Advanced Encryption Standard","sourcePdf":"ttc2010050608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144487S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5437556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5437556","articleId":"5406504","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5406509,"authors":[{"name":"Naixue Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5522945/5406509/5406509-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naixue Xiong received the PhD degree in computer science from Wuhan University and the PhD degree in computer science from Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.

The PID controller at each router computes its expected incoming rate and feed backs this rate to its upstream router, such that the local buffer occupancy can be stabilized at an appropriate value. We give the theoretical analysis of the proposed PID controller in terms of system stability. The proposed MR-M controller achieves the fairness in two aspects: 1) The intrasession fairness, i.e., the receivers from the same source within the same multicast session can receive data at different rates, if they subscribe networks with different capacities; 2) The intersession fairness, i.e., the link bandwidth is fairly shared among multiple multicast sessions from different sources. Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results have demonstrated a superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of system stability, high link utilization, and high throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406509/","volume":"21","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5406509/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11447030","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Efficient Flow Control Scheme for Multirate Multicast Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Efficient Flow Control Scheme for Multirate Multicast Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2010091254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11394S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5522945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5522945","articleId":"5406509","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5406511,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaorui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5556484/5406511/5406511-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaorui Wang received the BS degree from Southeast University, China, in 1995, the MS degree from the University of Louisville in 2002, and the PhD degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 2006, all in computer science.

In addition to reducing operating costs, precisely controlling power consumption is an essential way to avoid system failures caused by power capacity overload or overheating due to increasing high server density. Control-theoretic techniques have recently shown a lot of promise for power management because of their better control performance and theoretical guarantees on control accuracy and system stability. However, existing work oversimplifies the problem by controlling a single server independently from others. As a result, at the enclosure level where multiple high-density servers are correlated by common workloads and share common power supplies, power cannot be shared to improve application performance. In this paper, we propose an enclosure-level power controller that shifts power among servers based on their performance needs, while controlling the total power of the enclosure to be lower than a constraint. Our controller features a rigorous design based on an optimal Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) control theory. We present detailed control problem formulation and transformation to a standard constrained least-squares problem, as well as stability analysis in the face of significant workload variations. We then conduct extensive experiments on a physical testbed to compare our controller with three state-of-the-art controllers: a heuristic-based MIMO control solution, a Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) control solution, and an improved SISO controller with simple power shifting among servers. Our empirical results demonstrate that our controller outperforms all the three baselines by having more accurate power control and up to 11.8 percent better benchmark performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.31","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5556484/05406511.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556484","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Power Control for High-Density Servers in an Enclosure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Power Control for High-Density Servers in an Enclosure","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11487057","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5406511/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Power Control for High-Density Servers in an Enclosure","sourcePdf":"ttd2010101412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155185S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5556484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5556484","articleId":"5406511","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5406526,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SUNY, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5618480/5406526/5406526-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun Fu received the BEng degree in information engineering and the MEng degree in pattern recognition and intelligence systems, both from Xian Jiaotong University (XJTU), China, in 2001 and 2004 respectively; and the MS degree in statistics and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering, both from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Derived from rapid advances in computer graphics and machine vision, computer-based age synthesis and estimation via faces have become particularly prevalent topics recently because of their explosively emerging real-world applications, such as forensic art, electronic customer relationship management, security control and surveillance monitoring, biometrics, entertainment, and cosmetology. Age synthesis is defined to rerender a face image aesthetically with natural aging and rejuvenating effects on the individual face. Age estimation is defined to label a face image automatically with the exact age (year) or the age group (year range) of the individual face. Because of their particularity and complexity, both problems are attractive yet challenging to computer-based application system designers. Large efforts from both academia and industry have been devoted in the last a few decades. In this paper, we survey the complete state-of-the-art techniques in the face image-based age synthesis and estimation topics.

The method is based on the definition of a probabilistic criterion capable of assessing the level of coherence of an image series relative to a reference classification with a finer resolution. In opposition to approaches based on an a priori model of the data, the model developed here is based on the rejection of a nonstructured model-called a-contrario model-by the observation of structured data. This coherence measure is the core of a stochastic algorithm which automatically selects the image subdomain representing the most likely changes. A theoretical analysis of this model is led to predict its performances, in particular regarding the contrast level of the image as well as the number of change pixels in the image. Numerical simulations are also presented that confirm the high robustness of the method and its capacity to detect changes impacting more than 25 percent of a considered pixel under average conditions. An application to land-cover change detection is then provided using time series of satellite images.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5618480/05406527.pdf","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An A-Contrario Approach for Subpixel Change Detection in Satellite Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406527/","displayDocTitle":"An A-Contrario Approach for Subpixel Change Detection in Satellite Imagery","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623479","pubMedId":"20847388","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5406527/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An A-Contrario Approach for Subpixel Change Detection in Satellite Imagery","sourcePdf":"ttp2010111977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127473S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5618480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5618480","articleId":"5406527","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5406532,"authors":[{"name":"Kata Praditwong","affiliation":["The Centre of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications CERCIA, School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/5739154/5406532/5406532-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kata Praditwong received the BSc degree from Silpakorn University, Thailand, in 1996, the MSc degree from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, in 2001, and the PhD degree from the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom, in 2008.

There has been a great deal of recent interest in search-based formulations of this problem in which module boundaries are identified by automated search, guided by a fitness function that captures the twin objectives of high cohesion and low coupling in a single-objective fitness function. This paper introduces two novel multi-objective formulations of the software module clustering problem, in which several different objectives (including cohesion and coupling) are represented separately. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-objective approach, a set of experiments was performed on 17 real-world module clustering problems. The results of this empirical study provide strong evidence to support the claim that the multi-objective approach produces significantly better solutions than the existing single-objective approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2010.26","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5739154/05406532.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2010.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Module Clustering as a Multi-Objective Search Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406532/","displayDocTitle":"Software Module Clustering as a Multi-Objective Search Problem","volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883163","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5406532/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Module Clustering as a Multi-Objective Search Problem","sourcePdf":"tts2011020264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136977S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"5739154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"5739154","articleId":"5406532","onlineDate":"05 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5406561,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Liu","affiliation":["Sch. of Electron.

The simulation results show that the proposed approach HPSO outperforms standard PSO and classical evolutionary programming (CEP) in all test cases.","doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406657","startPage":"279","endPage":"282","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398735/5406533/05406657.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Applications (PACIIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid particle swarm optimizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Convergence","Evolutionary computation","Computational intelligence","Computer industry","Application software","Hybrid power systems","Benchmark testing","Genetic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimizer","population based evolutionary algorithm","optimization problem","multimodal problem","crossover operator","classical evolutionary programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","crossover","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid particle swarm optimizer","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5406657/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106845","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid particle swarm optimizer","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064122S","chronDate":"28-29 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398735","isNumber":"5406533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398735","xplore-issue":"5406533","articleId":"5406657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5406669,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Tehranipoor","affiliation":["University of Connecticut, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Tehranipoor is an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Connecticut, Storrs.

We employ serially nonbinary iterative decoding in the receiver. Symbol-wise Extrinsic Information Transfer chart (EXIT) is used to analyze convergence property of SC-OVCDM system, based on EXIT we propose a search algorithm to look for optimal inner code.

A hierarchical vehicle stability control strategy is used. The high level of the control strategy is the vehicle motion control level. And the low level is the control allocation level in which the longitudinal force's distribution is the focal point. Through the analysis of the tire characteristics under the combined longitudinal and lateral forces, an effectiveness matrix for the control allocation considering the longitudinal force's impact on the lateral force was proposed. Then based on Quadratic Programming method the longitudinal force of each wheel has been optimal distributed. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the vehicle handling stability, meanwhile the control efficiency is also improved.","doi":"10.1109/PEITS.2009.5406779","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Power Electronics and Intelligent Transportation System (PEITS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398765/5406734/05406779.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEITS.2009.5406779","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Power Electronics and Intelligent Transportation System (PEITS)","startPage":"307","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control allocation of vehicle dynamics control for a 4 in-wheel-motored EV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5406779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Control allocation of vehicle dynamics control for a 4 in-wheel-motored EV","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5406779/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5406779/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136700","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control allocation of vehicle dynamics control for a 4 in-wheel-motored EV","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038941S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398765","isNumber":"5406734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398765","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5406734","articleId":"5406779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5406785,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ya","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"lastName":"Li Ya","id":"37396111800"},{"name":"Lina Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"lastName":"Lina Zhang","id":"37396109700"},{"name":"Liqin Jia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"lastName":"Liqin Jia","id":"37398743000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4544-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5406785","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","OFDM modulation","Interchannel interference","Bandwidth","Intelligent transportation systems","Design methodology","Signal design","Power electronics","Data models","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","fast Fourier transforms","interference suppression","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["new equalization method","OFDM system","FFT transform matrix","uniform phase vectors","column vectors","OFDM symbols","co-channel interference signals","interference signals suppression","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM System","Equalization","Cyclic property","Over-sampling"]}],"abstract":"It is well known that the column vectors of FFT transform matrix are uniform phase vectors of unit circle and the components of a column represent the different phases of the vector, which is called the cyclic property of the column vectors.

We present first the ICA based blind equalization for MIMO OFDM systems, where the non-redundant linear precoding is employed to resolve the ambiguity in the ICA equalized signal and reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM signal. Then we discuss the application of ICA to the blind compensation for both frequency-dependent and frequency-independent inphase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance in MIMO OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the ICA based equalization approach provides a much better performance than that of the subspace method with significant PAPR reduction. In addition, the ICA based I/Q compensation approach outperforms not only previous methods, but also the case with perfect channel state information and no I/Q imbalance due to additional frequency diversity gains.","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Computers and Devices for Communication (CODEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Computers and Devices for Communication (CODEC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398767/5407062/05407081.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent component analysis - an innovative technique for wireless MIMO OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407081/","displayDocTitle":"Independent component analysis - an innovative technique for wireless MIMO OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407081/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent component analysis - an innovative technique for wireless MIMO OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"PID1076895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068297S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398767","isNumber":"5407062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398767","xplore-issue":"5407062","articleId":"5407081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CODEC","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5407087,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this particular access system, each user is identified by a unique code. While assigning distinct spreading code to each user, our objective is to find out as many codes as possible to serve a huge number of users. However, we must also make sure that the cross-correlation value between any pair of distinct spreading codes should be as low as possible in order to permit a very less multiuser interference. In this paper, we have proposed small set orthogonal Kasami sequence which is capable of providing more number of different codes as compared to popularly used orthogonal spreading code in synchronous CDMA system such as Walsh code.

The overall performance of a DS-CDMA system is degraded by multipath fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). To evaluate the degradation, the expression for the conditional BER, conditioned on a given level of fading is derived and then the unconditional BER is evaluated. This approach is also extended to estimate the BER performance of the system having multiple receiving antennas. The selection method and maximal ratio combining (MRC) method are employed as diversity combining schemes and it is found that both the schemes offer almost the same BER improvement. Moreover, convolutional channel coding is applied in the DS-CDMA system and it is noted to provide more enhancements in the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407154","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398764/5407064/05407154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407064","startPage":"115","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of selection and maximal ratio combining diversity techniques on a DS-CDMA wireless communication system impaired by fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effectiveness of selection and maximal ratio combining diversity techniques on a DS-CDMA wireless communication system impaired by fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407154/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106952","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5407154/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effectiveness of selection and maximal ratio combining diversity techniques on a DS-CDMA wireless communication system impaired by fading","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence022ID616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061447S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398764","isNumber":"5407064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398764","xplore-issue":"5407064","articleId":"5407154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5407156,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In our analysis, Gaussian-shaped optical orthogonal codes are employed as address sequence and avalanche photodiode is used in an optical correlator receiver. The signal to noise power for the proposed system is evaluated on account of receiver, optical amplifier and multiuser access interference noises. The system performance is determined as a function of optical signal power, code length, code weight, number of simultaneous users, and fiber length. The power penalty suffered by the system is evaluated at bit error rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n.

Efficient spectrum management algorithms are necessary to achieve immense success in wireless communications. Cognitive radio seems to be a panacea for increased utilization of licensed spectrum. It is defined as the new state of art technique that opportunistically share the licensed spectrum while imposing minimum interference to the licensed users. In this paper, we explore the adaptive characteristics of cognitive radio in secure and reliable communication. But the question is how to make the communication reliable such that there occurs no eavesdropping and information leakage. The possible solutions include integrating the merits of spread spectrum modulation, using encryption algorithms (public key and private key encryption), and its potential to switch over various frequency bands.

Consequently, a great deal of research is being focused on addressing important problems in molecular biology by analyzing these data using mathematical and computational approaches. Genomic signal processing has been an active area of research for the past two decades and have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers from digital signal processing area all over the world. An important step in genomic annotation is to identify protein coding regions of DNA sequence especially in the study of eukaryotic genomes. Due to lack of obvious sequence features among exons and introns, distinguishing protein coding regions from non-coding regions effectively is a challenging problem. A variety of computational algorithms have been developed to predict exons. Most of the exon finding algorithms are based on statistics methods. The signal processing approaches of recent years may identify some hidden periodicity and features which can not be revealed easily by conventional statistics methods. In this paper the authors have presented an algorithm to separate out coding regions from non-coding regions based on positional frequency distribution of nucleotides and the algorithm shows the results that exon regions exhibit more random behavior compared to intron regions. Such a behavior was also observed by FFT power spectrum analysis of DNA sequences. Case studies on genes from different organisms show that the algorithm is an effective approach towards exon prediction.","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Computers and Devices for Communication (CODEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Computers and Devices for Communication (CODEC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398767/5407062/05407254.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407062","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and analysis of coding and non-coding regions of a DNA sequence by positional frequency distribution of nucleotides (PFDN) algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identification and analysis of coding and non-coding regions of a DNA sequence by positional frequency distribution of nucleotides (PFDN) algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407254/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107285","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5407254/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and analysis of coding and non-coding regions of a DNA sequence by positional frequency distribution of nucleotides (PFDN) algorithm","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"PID1081009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101191S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398767","isNumber":"5407062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398767","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5407062","articleId":"5407254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CODEC","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5407262,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Proper diversity among component networks is considered an important parameter for ensemble construction so that failure of one may be compensated by others. Data sampling, i.e., different training sets for different networks, is the most investigated technique for diversity than other approaches. This paper presents a data sampling based neural network ensemble method where individual networks are trained on the union of original training set and a set of some artificially generated examples. Generated examples are different for different networks and are the element to produce diversity among the networks. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on a suite of 20 benchmark classification problems. The experimental results show that the performance of this ensemble method is better or competitive with respect to the existing popular methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407262","startPage":"349","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407064","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398764/5407064/05407262.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network ensembles based on Artificial Training Examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407262/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network ensembles based on Artificial Training Examples","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407262/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11136621","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network ensembles based on Artificial Training Examples","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence062ID302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047523S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398764","isNumber":"5407064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398764","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5407064","articleId":"5407262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5407263,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The approach proposed here is based on the flux estimation of high performance induction motor drives. Simulation of the drive system was carried out to study the performance of the motor drive. It is observed that the proposed CRTRL algorithm based methodology provides better performance than the BP and URTRL algorithm based technique. The proposed method can be used for accurate measurement of the rotor flux.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407263","startPage":"355","endPage":"360","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398764/5407064/05407263.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three algorithms for learning artificial neural network: A comparison for induction motor flux estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Induction motors","Artificial intelligence","Recurrent neural networks","DC motors","Low pass filters","Induction motor drives","Motor drives","Rotors","Learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","induction motor drives","neural nets","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor flux estimation","learning artificial neural network","neural estimator","backpropagation","uncorrelated real time recurrent learning","high performance induction motor drive"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back-propagation (BP)","Correlated real time recurrent learning (CRTRL)","Induction motor","Recurrent neural network","Rotor flux","Uncorrelated real time recurrent learning (URTRL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Three algorithms for learning artificial neural network: A comparison for induction motor flux estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407263/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106970","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three algorithms for learning artificial neural network: A comparison for induction motor flux estimation","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence063ID394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094186S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398764","isNumber":"5407064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398764","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5407064","articleId":"5407263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5407265,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyan kumar debnath","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Kalyan kumar","lastName":"debnath","id":"37088244988"},{"name":"Jayanta kumar ahdikary","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Jayanta kumar","lastName":"ahdikary","id":"37088238106"},{"name":"Md.

The individual neural networks (NN) in an ENN are trained via negative correlation learning. The object of using negative correlation learning (NCL) is to expertise the individuals in an ensemble on different parts or portion of input patterns. The available currencies in the market consist of new, old and noisy ones. It is often difficult for machine to recognize these currencies; therefore we propose a system that uses ENN to identify them. We performed our experiment for seven different types of TAKA (Bangladeshi currency) they are 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 TAKA. The image of different types note is converted in gray scale and compressed in our desired range. Each pixel of the compressed image is given as an input to the network. This system is able to recognize highly noisy or old image of TAKA. Ensemble network is very useful for the classification of different types of currency. It reduces the chances of misclassification than a single network and ensemble network with independent training. In experimental results we have shown this. We also find good result for similar pattern available in market.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407265/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11106972","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407265/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A currency recognition system using negatively correlated neural network ensemble","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A currency recognition system using negatively correlated neural network ensemble","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence065ID497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064144S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398764","isNumber":"5407064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398764","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5407064","articleId":"5407265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5407267,"authors":[{"name":"Ghulam Muhammad","affiliation":["College of Computer & Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ghulam","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37395625800"},{"name":"Yousef A.

Though Bangla is one of the largely spoken languages in the world, only a few works on Bangla ASR can be found in the literature, especially on Bangladeshi accented Bangla. In this work, the corpus is collected from natives in Bangladesh. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) based features and hidden Markov model (HMM) based classifiers are used for recognition. Experimental results show comparatively high recognition performance (more than 95%) for first six digits (0 - 5) and low performance (less than 90%) for the next four digits (6 - 9). We notice two confused pairs of digits: one with (6) and (9), and the other with (7) and (8), in the experiments. We also find that different dialects in Bangladesh have a greater role on this confusion.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407267","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398764/5407064/05407267.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic speech recognition for Bangla digits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407267/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic speech recognition for Bangla digits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136623","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407267/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic speech recognition for Bangla digits","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence067ID235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05988S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398764","isNumber":"5407064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398764","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5407064","articleId":"5407267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5407294,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Al Mamun","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Abdullah Al","lastName":"Mamun","id":"37085522217"},{"name":"Saiful Islam","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Saiful","lastName":"Islam","id":"38189861000"},{"name":"Farzana Yesmin","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Farzana","lastName":"Yesmin","id":"37085927363"},{"name":"Masuma Akter","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Masuma","lastName":"Akter","id":"37085929103"},{"name":"Shaikh Afsana Jahan","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Shaikh Afsana","lastName":"Jahan","id":"37085928105"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6284-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6281-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6283-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5407294","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Power control","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Interference","Stability","Power system modeling","Power engineering computing","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","adaptive control","cochannel interference","code division multiple access","modulation","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication control","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive step power control algorithm","3G WCDMA cellular system","radio resource management method","cochannel interferences","adjacent-channel interferences","power control algorithm modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASPC","Average outage percentage","Novel ASPC","Signal to Interference ratio","WCDMA"]}],"abstract":"Power control is an essential radio resource management method in CDMA cellular communication systems, where co-channel and adjacent-channel interferences are the primary capacity limiting factors. Power control intends to control the transmission power levels in such a way that required quality of service for the users is guaranteed with lowest possible transmission powers. In this paper, a modulation of power control algorithm is proposed for the 3G WCDMA system. The algorithm is figured on a modification of the transmitted power update step size. Instead of the fixed value presently suggested, the step size is modified dynamically in order to obtain more adapted power variations as well as the step is also represented as a function of the difference between the target and estimated SIR of the MS to obtain more stability of the system. A general form of this algorithm is presented and it is then studied in a simple simulation. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated with the outage percentage, which is the percentage of the number of MS's whose received SIR falls below the fixed threshold. The focused requirement, which had been tried to achieve by this algorithm, is the stability, which was studied and represented through simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Adaptive Step Power Control algorithm for 3G WCDMA cellular system","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407294","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Conference on Computers and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398764/5407064/05407294.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.5407294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel Adaptive Step Power Control algorithm for 3G WCDMA cellular system","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407294/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11106986","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Adaptive Step Power Control algorithm for 3G WCDMA cellular system","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence093ID174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044167S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398764","isNumber":"5407064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398764","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5407064","articleId":"5407294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5407298,"authors":[{"name":"James Y.

Usually the application of this technique employs the usage of a step generator to drive one end of the transmission line and a high speed oscilloscope to visualize the signal reflected at various impedance discontinuities points. This paper presents the design and implementation of an USB-based time domain reflectometer which integrates the functions of both equipments and is intended to be a low cost solution for time domain reflectometry. The acquisition technique used is sequential sampling based on integrated delay lines, giving a time step of 250 [ps] at a total acquisition time of about 2.6 [us]. Sequential sampling is successfully used for high speed sampling oscilloscopes and can be implemented using commercially available components. Unlike similar implementations of the method, our proposal uses internal delay calibration to eliminate the ghost effect which limits the minimum measurable cable length. Also, by comparison with random sampling TDRs, our approach allows an improved control over the acquisition parameters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIITME.2009.5407341","publicationTitle":"2009 15th International Symposium for Design and Technology of Electronics Packages (SIITME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th International Symposium for Design and Technology of Electronics Packages (SIITME)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400048/5407333/05407341.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"371","doi":"10.1109/SIITME.2009.5407341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential sampling time domain reflectometer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sequential sampling time domain reflectometer","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5407341/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136838","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407341/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential sampling time domain reflectometer","confLoc":"Gyula, Hungary","sourcePdf":"F002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031643S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400048","isNumber":"5407333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400048","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5407333","articleId":"5407341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5407343,"authors":[{"name":"Silvana-Oana Popescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, \"Politehnica\" University of Timisoara, ROMANIA"],"firstName":"Silvana-Oana","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37902685200"},{"name":"Aurel-Stefan Gontean","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, \"Politehnica\" University of Timisoara, ROMANIA"],"firstName":"Aurel-Stefan","lastName":"Gontean","id":"38538449100"},{"name":"Ioan Lie","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, \"Politehnica\" University of Timisoara, ROMANIA"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Lie","id":"37396086400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5132-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5133-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5407343","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Soldering","Resistors","Circuit testing","Electronic packaging thermal management","Temperature","Thermal conductivity","Copper","Voltage","Failure analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit layout","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA behavioral simulation","post route simulation","post-layout simulator","ISE","Xilinx","ring counter","integrated circuit testing","circuit delays"]}],"abstract":"The goal of this paper is to investigate the simulation capabilities of modern FPGA post-layout simulator (ISE from Xilinx) compared to real life behavior.

The main reasons are the lack of proper methods to classify the acoustic units into more than two classes and suitable SVM based sequence decoders. This paper describes a trainable method for SVM multi-class classification based on confidence measures of the sets of two-class SVM classifiers using an artificial neural network. In addition, a pruning method has been proposed for SVM multi-class classification to decrease the computational complexity without significant decrease in accuracy. Also, a method has been proposed for time series recognition of the feature vectors of an utterance based on SVM classifiers. The experiments have been conducted on a set of confusable phonemes using TIMIT corpus. The results of the first method show 10% and 6% relative improvements in the recognition rate in comparison to one-versus-one and Kruger methods respectively for /b/, /d/ and /g/ phonemes. In addition, it is empirically deduced that the proposed phoneme classification framework yields significantly better classification rates than classic voting method. Comparing phoneme classification results of the proposed method with one-versus-one method indicate a 26% improvement in the classification rate for /b/, /d/ and /g/ phonemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407477","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400047/5407474/05407477.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-class SVM based phonemes classifier based on a trainable confidence measure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A multi-class SVM based phonemes classifier based on a trainable confidence measure","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407477/","accessionNumber":"11107292","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407477/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-class SVM based phonemes classifier based on a trainable confidence measure","confLoc":"Ajman, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"sp3702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077842S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400047","isNumber":"5407474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400047","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5407474","articleId":"5407477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5407487,"authors":[{"name":"Octavian Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Octavian","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37396236200"},{"name":"Waleed Abdulla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Waleed","lastName":"Abdulla","id":"37269172600"},{"name":"Zoran Salcic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Salcic","id":"37264903700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5950-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5949-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5948-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7843"}],"articleNumber":"5407487","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":470},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Real time systems","Hardware","Application software","Embedded software","Probability","Bandwidth","Information retrieval","Concurrent computing","Speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition system","hardware accelerator","hardware-software coprocessing","GMM emission probability calculation","Altera Stratix II FPGA device","Nios II softcore processor","frequency 100 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition","Embedded application","Real-time system","Softcore processor","Field Programmable Gate Arrays"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a hardware/software co-processing speech recognizer for embedded applications is proposed.

If a scalar regularization is considered, it has been noted that the optimal value of the regularizing factor has no closed-form expression. In a recent work, we proved that by using a regularization matrix instead, we not only enhance the performance but also can determine a closed-form expression for the optimal regularizing matrix that minimizes the asymptotic mean-square-error of the channel estimate. In this paper, we generalize our work to the context of multiple-input-multiple-output-orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM). As an application, we propose to make a performance comparison between linear prediction and subspace semi-blind estimators. In particular, we assess by simulations the accuracy of the derived results and investigate the bit error rate performance as well as the impact of channel over modeling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400047/5407474/05407506.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407474","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized semi-blind estimator over MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Closed-form solution","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Convolution","Telecommunications","Educational institutions","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","least squares approximations","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM systems","semiblind channel estimation","regularizing parameter","least square criterion","scalar regularization","regularization matrix","mean square error","multiple input multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","linear prediction","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semi-blind equalization","MIMO-OFDM","regularization","asymptotic performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Regularized semi-blind estimator over MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407506/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107310","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized semi-blind estimator over MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Ajman, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"SP3787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082365S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400047","isNumber":"5407474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400047","xplore-issue":"5407474","articleId":"5407506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5407512,"authors":[{"name":"Jiuling Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jiuling Tang","id":"37402549800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5950-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5949-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5948-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7843"}],"articleNumber":"5407512","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":881},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Viterbi algorithm","Maximum likelihood decoding","Convolutional codes","Forward error correction","Throughput","Testing","Wireless communication","Channel capacity","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","table lookup","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","high-speed Viterbi decoder","SystemVerilog","ModelSim co-simulation","field programmable gate array","algorithmic state machine flowchart","lookup tables","hard decision decoder","RTL code","self checking test bench","Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional encoder","Viterbi decoder","FPGA","SystemVerilog","Co-simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407512","abstract":"Design and field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of a high-speed Viterbi decoder with a constraint length of 7 and a code rate of 1/2 is presented here.

Most studies into limited feedback precoded (MIMO - OFDM) systems are based on the notion of time invariant channels throughout transmission. Therefore, the precoding matrix for each subcarrier can be designed at the receiver in terms of the current channel state, fed back to the transmitter, and used for the subsequent block of data symbols. However, in time varying channels, the feedback information becomes outdated, which results in significant system performance degradation. To mitigate this system performance degradation caused by outdated information due to a delay in the feedback channel, this paper considers a more practical system, where the channel varies from one block of symbols to another. A method is proposed based on modelling the channel as an autoregressive (AR) model and using a Kalman filter linear predictor at the receiver to predict the channels states, required to design the precoding matrices for the next OFDM symbol carriers whose indexes are fed back to the transmitter. The performance of this method is investigated using computer simulation, and the results obtained for the proposed channel prediction demonstrate improved bit error rate performance for time-varying Rayleigh fading channels, even in systems with high mobility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel prediction for limited feedback precoded MIMO-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407516","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400047/5407474/05407516.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407474","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel prediction for limited feedback precoded MIMO-OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407516/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107317","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel prediction for limited feedback precoded MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Ajman, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"SP3750.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06355S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400047","isNumber":"5407474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400047","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5407474","articleId":"5407516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5407518,"authors":[{"name":"Rabab M.

It is the most important step that affects the performance of a pattern recognition system. This paper presents a novel feature selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The algorithm is applied to coefficients extracted by two feature extraction techniques: the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The proposed PSO-based feature selection algorithm is utilized to search the feature space for the optimal feature subset where features are carefully selected according to a well defined discrimination criterion. Evolution is driven by a fitness function defined in terms of maximizing the class separation (scatter index). The classifier performance and the length of selected feature vector are considered for performance evaluation using the ORL face database. Experimental results show that the PSO-based feature selection algorithm was found to generate excellent recognition results with the minimal set of selected features.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407518","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400047/5407474/05407518.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"584","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization for human face recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization for human face recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11107319","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5407518/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization for human face recognition","confLoc":"Ajman, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"SP3738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101714S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400047","isNumber":"5407474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400047","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5407474","articleId":"5407518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5407520,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Most channel estimation methods rely on some form of training which reduces the useful data rate. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that blindly estimates the channel by maximizing the log likelihood of the channel given the output data. Finding the likelihood function of a linear system can be very difficult. However, in the OFDM case, central limit arguments can be used to argue that the time-domain input is Gaussian. This together with the Gaussian assumption on the noise makes the output data Gaussian. The output likelihood function can then be maximized to obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the channel. Unfortunately, this optimization problem is not convex and thus finding the global maximum is challenging. In this paper, we propose two methods to find the global maximum of the ML objective function. One is the blind Genetic algorithm and the other is the semi-blind Steepest descent method. The performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407520","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400047/5407474/05407520.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel estimation in OFDM systems by relying on the Gaussian assumption of the input","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407520/","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel estimation in OFDM systems by relying on the Gaussian assumption of the input","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11136818","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407520/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel estimation in OFDM systems by relying on the Gaussian assumption of the input","confLoc":"Ajman, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"SP3717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051406S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400047","isNumber":"5407474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400047","xplore-issue":"5407474","articleId":"5407520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5407542,"authors":[{"name":"Heba Shaban","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering AAST, Virginia Tech Antenna Group, USA","Dept. of Electrical and Computer Eng., AAST."],"firstName":"Heba","lastName":"Shaban","id":"37284029500"},{"name":"M.

In this paper, a performance comparison between the real and the complex version of the Schnorr-Euchner (SE) sphere decoder has been carried out in order to find out which algorithm is the most suitable depending on the application. Furthermore a recently appeared fixed-complexity version of the SE decoder (FSD) has been evaluated both in terms of complexity and performance and the results have been compared with the original version.

We propose to improve the use of the quantized variational filtering (QVF) by jointly optimize the quantization level and estimate the path-loss between sensors. Recently, quantized variational filtering QVF has been proved to be adapted to the communication constraints of sensor networks. Its efficiency relies on the fact that the online update of the filtering distribution and its compression are executed simultaneously. Our proposed technique is developed to jointly optimize the quantization level and estimate the path-loss coefficient, where the sensors are connected with unknown fading channels. First, sensors observations are quantized under a constant transmitting power constraint. This quantization is performed by online maximizing the predictive Fisher Information (FI). Then, we estimate the path-loss coefficient by maximizing its a posteriori distribution. The simulation results show that the joint adaptive quantization and fading channel estimation algorithm, for the same sensor transmitting power, outperforms both the VF algorithm using a fixed optimal quantization level and the VF algorithm based on binary sensors.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400047/5407474/05407552.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"615","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407552","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407552","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407552","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Fading","Target tracking","Wireless sensor networks","Filtering","Batteries","Bayesian methods","State estimation","Intelligent networks","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","channel estimation","estimation theory","fading channels","filtering theory","prediction theory","quantisation (signal)","target tracking","variational techniques","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint adaptive quantization","fading channel estimation","target tracking","wireless sensor networks","quantized variational filtering","jointly optimize the quantization level","path loss estimation","constant transmitting power constraint","predictive Fisher information","a posteriori distribution","binary sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Networks","quantized variational filtering","maximum a posteriori","adaptive algorithm","fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407552/","displayDocTitle":"Joint adaptive quantization and fading channel estimation for target tracking in wireless sensor networks","accessionNumber":"11107345","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5407552/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint adaptive quantization and fading channel estimation for target tracking in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Ajman, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"SP3619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04473S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400047","isNumber":"5407474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400047","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5407474","articleId":"5407552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5407556,"authors":[{"name":"J.

New clutter filters were successfully designed for processing different numbers of samples and their performances were studied by comparing their dynamic frequency responses with the desired steady-state frequency responses.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407556","startPage":"430","endPage":"435","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400047/5407474/05407556.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of IIR filters for a limited number of samples with optimum dynamic frequency responses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of IIR filters for a limited number of samples with optimum dynamic frequency responses","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407556/","accessionNumber":"11136826","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407556/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of IIR filters for a limited number of samples with optimum dynamic frequency responses","confLoc":"Ajman, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"SP3604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03896S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400047","isNumber":"5407474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400047","xplore-issue":"5407474","articleId":"5407556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5407563,"authors":[{"name":"Taisir H.

In contrast to the PTP-SD that considers the tightening of necessary conditions in the sphere search using per-layer radius adjustment, the proposed method focuses on the sphere radius control strategy when a candidate lattice point is found. For this purpose, the dynamic radius update strategy depending on the lattice point found as well as the lattice independent radius selection scheme are jointly exploited. As a result, while maintaining the effectiveness of the PTP-SD, further reduction of the computational complexity, in particular for high SNR regime, can be achieved. From simulations in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channels, it is shown that the proposed method provides a considerable improvement in complexity with near-ML performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On further reduction of complexity in tree pruning based sphere search","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080340","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407602.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"On further reduction of complexity in tree pruning based sphere search","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5407602/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105719","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On further reduction of complexity in tree pruning based sphere search","sourcePdf":"417-tc1002-shim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066076S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5407603,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-rong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Rong-rong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276945900"},{"name":"Ronghui Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Ronghui","lastName":"Peng","id":"37285453100"},{"name":"Alexei Ashikhmin","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Alexei","lastName":"Ashikhmin","id":"37272162900"},{"name":"Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Behrouz","lastName":"Farhang-Boroujeny","id":"38265010700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5407603","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":778},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching MIMO capacity using bitwise Markov Chain Monte Carlo detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Monte Carlo methods","Detectors","Parity check codes","Decoding","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","Turbo codes","Transmitting antennas","Concatenated codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO capacity","Markov Chain Monte Carlo detection","near capacity performance","Log-MAP-tb b-MCMC","low-density parity-check code","transmit/receive antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO detection, Markov chain Monte Carlo","list sphere decoding, LDPC codes, channel capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407603","abstract":"This paper examines near capacity performance of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) detectors for multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The proposed MCMC detector (Log-MAP-tb b-MCMC) operates in a strictly bit-wise fashion and adopts Log-MAP algorithm with table look-up. When concatenated with an optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, Log-MAP-tb b-MCMC can operate within 1.2-1.8 dB of the capacity of MIMO systems with 8 transmit/receive antennas at spectral efficiencies up to \u00bf = 24 bits/channel use (b/ch). This result improves upon best performance achieved by turbo coded systems using list sphere decoding (LSD) detector by 2.3-3.8 dB, leading to nearly 50% reduction in the capacity gap. Detailed comparisons of the Log-MAP-tb b-MCMC with LSD based detectors demonstrate that MCMC detector is indeed the detector of choice for achieving channel capacity both in terms of performance and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080533","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407603.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"423","endPage":"428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Approaching MIMO capacity using bitwise Markov Chain Monte Carlo detection","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5407603/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11136099","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching MIMO capacity using bitwise Markov Chain Monte Carlo detection","sourcePdf":"423-tc1002-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045175S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5407604,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Souto","affiliation":["Ed.

Multiple antennas are deployed at both users and at RS. Single carrier cyclic prefix (SCCP) is used to combat intersymbol interference (ISI) in frequency-selective fading channels. The transmission process is divided into two time slots. At the first time slot, both users send their information to RS concurrently. RS then amplifies and broadcasts its received signals at the second time slot. We propose an algorithm to estimate the channel information at end users based on the least square (LS) principle. To further minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the estimate, a method to design the optimal training sequences is also proposed. Simulation results show that the performance achieved by our optimal design is close to that with perfect channel information.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407613.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal training sequences for channel estimation in bi-directional relay networks with multiple antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407613/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal training sequences for channel estimation in bi-directional relay networks with multiple antennas","volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105728","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407613/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal training sequences for channel estimation in bi-directional relay networks with multiple antennas","sourcePdf":"474-tc1002-pham.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053917S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5407614,"authors":[{"name":"Don Torrieri","affiliation":["US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5407594/5407614/5407614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Don Torrieri is a research engineer and Fellow of the US Army Research Laboratory.

This paper proposes a numerical approach for the minimization of decoding complexity for long-block-length irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The proposed design methodology is applicable to any binary-input memoryless symmetric channel and any iterative message-passing decoding algorithm with a parallel-update schedule. A key feature of the proposed optimization method is a new complexity measure that incorporates both the number of operations required to carry out a single decoding iteration and the number of iterations required for convergence. This paper shows that the proposed complexity measure can be accurately estimated from a density-evolution and extrinsic-information transfer chart analysis of the code. A sufficient condition is presented for convexity of the complexity measure in the variable edge-degree distribution; when it is not satisfied, numerical experiments nevertheless suggest that the local minimum is unique. The results presented herein show that when the decoding complexity is constrained, the complexity-optimized codes significantly outperform threshold-optimized codes at long block lengths, within the ensemble of irregular codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407615.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of irregular LDPC codes with optimized performance-complexity tradeoff","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of irregular LDPC codes with optimized performance-complexity tradeoff","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407615/","publicationDate":"February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11105714","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407615/","volume":"58","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of irregular LDPC codes with optimized performance-complexity tradeoff","sourcePdf":"489-tc1002-smith.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104814S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5407616,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Alvarado","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Communication Systems Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5407594/5407616/5407616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Alvarado (S'06) was born in 1982 in Quell\u03ccn, Chilo\u00e9 Island, Chile.

In particular, the contribution of this paper is twofold: i) first of all, by relying on the Gauss quadrature rule (GQR) representation of the moment generation function (MGF) for a log-normal distribution, we develop accurate formulas for important performance indexes whose accuracy can be estimated a priori and just depends on GQR numerical integration errors; ii) then, in order to simplify the computational burden of the former framework for some system setups, we propose various approximations, which are based on the Improved Schwartz-Yeh (I-SY) method.

The spectrally precoded OFDM signal provides very small power spectral sidelobes decaying asymptotically as f\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2J-2</sup>\n with J integer-valued design parameter, thereby suppressing sidelobe powers effectively and achieving higher spectral efficiency than nonprecoded rectangularly-pulsed OFDM which has power spectral sidelobes decaying asymptotically as f\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n. The CE-OFDM signal exhibits a unity peak-to-average power ratio, and thus enables the efficient use of transmitter's power amplifier. In this paper, a specific CE-OFDM block signaling format is proposed to incorporate spectral precoding with an aim to suppressing sidelobe powers more effectively than conventional nonprecoded CE-OFDM. The general constraint on spectral precoding is developed to ensure that the power spectral sidelobes of the spectrally precoded CE-OFDM block signal with arbitrary data statistics decay asymptotically as f\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2J-2</sup>\n. Some spectral codes previously found for spectrally precoded OFDM are shown to meet the constraint and thus suited for spectrally precoded CE-OFDM. Specifically, spectral performance is analyzed for the spectrally precoded CE-OFDM block signal with independent and identically distributed data to illustrate the prevailing spectral advantage. The corresponding receiver is also developed to demodulate the spectrally precoded CE-OFDM block signal over dispersive channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407621.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral precoding for constant-envelope OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency division multiplexing","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal design","Peak to average power ratio","Power amplifiers","Statistical distributions","Signal analysis","Spectral analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","precoding","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral precoding","constant-envelope OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","discrete Fourier transform","counteract channel dispersion","integer-valued design parameter","spectral efficiency","rectangularly-pulsed OFDM","power spectral sidelobes decaying","unity peak-to-average power ratio","power amplifier","block signaling format","sidelobe powers","arbitrary data statistics decay","spectral codes","spectral performance analysis","CE-OFDM block signal","dispersive channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","constant envelope, spectral precoding, sidelobe suppression","frequency-domain equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectral precoding for constant-envelope OFDM","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5407621/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105730","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral precoding for constant-envelope OFDM","sourcePdf":"555-tc1002-chung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152253S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5407622,"authors":[{"name":"Ui-kun Kwon","affiliation":["POSTECH, South Korea","Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5407594/5407622/5407622-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ui-Kun Kwon received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree at Communications Research Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2009.

The proposed systems achieve spatial diversity over frequency selective channels in a distributed fashion without cyclic prefix (CP), which increases spectral efficiency of conventional relay-assisted systems. In practical mobile applications, the CP-less distributed STBC (D-STBC) SC-FDE suffers from the time selectivity of wireless fading channels, resulting in a deviation from the basic assumption of Alamouti codeword. In order to obtain a reliable performance over doubly selective channels, the CP-less D-SFBC SC-FDE and its efficient implementation are presented. Further, the performance of these two distributed SC transmissions is analytically compared over fast fading (i.e., time selective) environments. For evaluation of mean square error over fast fading channels, we present a channel model that captures the time-varying nature of wireless channels. It is shown through analysis that the CP-less DSFBC SC-FDE outperforms the CP-less D-STBC SC-FDE when there exists a severe Doppler spread.

In many applications the number of tags entering and leaving the detection range of the reader is subject to a strong fluctuation and usually unknown. The current number of tags in the field is a crucial parameter to operate the FSA anti-collision in an optimal manner. Therefore, a lot of effort is spent on the estimation of this parameter and a range of different estimation techniques exist. The contributions of this paper are: 1) a closed formula for the probability of any observed event defined by the number of empty, singleton, and collision slots in the observed frame is developed and empirically verified. 2) This formula is then modified to compute the probability for partly observed frames as well which is of great interest as the referred standards allow for the in-frame adjustment of the frame size without quitting the interrogation round. 3) Then, a maximum likelihood estimator is formulated to yield the estimated number of tags on a slot-wise basis. 4) Its superior estimation performance is compared to the known best estimators over the complete parameter set. While its performance is strongly superior compared to Schoute\u00bfs estimate, compared to Vogt\u00bfs MSE estimator only marginally improvement is obtained1.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407623.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slot-wise maximum likelihood estimation of the tag population size in FSA protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407623/","displayDocTitle":"Slot-wise maximum likelihood estimation of the tag population size in FSA protocols","volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11136098","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407623/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slot-wise maximum likelihood estimation of the tag population size in FSA protocols","sourcePdf":"578-tc1002-knerr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066762S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5407624,"authors":[{"name":"Myonghee Park","affiliation":["Digital Media & Communication R &D Center, Samsung Electronics Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5407594/5407624/5407624-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Myonghee Park received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea in 1998, 2000, and 2005, respectively.

A more realistic approach taking into account the thermal noise is intrinsically more difficult because it requires dealing with Glauber coherent states in an infinite-dimensional space. In particular, the exact evaluation of the optimal measurement operators is a very difficult task, and numerical approximation is unavoidable. The paper faces the problem by approximating the P-representation of the noisy quantum states with a large but finite numbers of terms and applying to them the square root measurement (SRM) approach. Comparisons with cases where the exact solution are known show that the SRM approach gives quite accurate results. As application, the performance of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) systems is considered. In spite of the fact that the SRM approach is not optimal and overestimates the error probability, also in these cases the quantum detection maintains its superiority with respect to the classical homodyne detection.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407627.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","startPage":"623","endPage":"630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of quantum data transmission systems in the presence of thermal noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of quantum data transmission systems in the presence of thermal noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105723","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5407627/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of quantum data transmission systems in the presence of thermal noise","sourcePdf":"623-tc1002-cariolaro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090459S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5407628,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Buzzi","affiliation":["DAEIMI, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5407594/5407628/5407628-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Buzzi (M'98-SM07) was born in Piano di Sorrento, Italy on December 10, 1970.

Assuming that non-linear serial interference cancellation is performed at the receiver, the problem of noncooperative SINR maximization with respect to each user's spreading code and uplink receiver is first considered. It is shown that iterative SINR maximization converges in a finite number of steps, and that the equilibrium resulting from noncooperative behavior is also Pareto-optimal. Next, the problem of optimal multiuser detection for a system using the above optimal spreading codes is also considered, and it is shown that, for such a system, maximum likelihood detection entails a computational complexity that is exponential in the ratio between the number of users and the system processing gain, thus providing huge savings with respect to the general case wherein the optimal receiver has a complexity exponential in the number of users. While initially considering a simple frequencyflat synchronous CDMA system, the obtained results are then extended to more general scenarios, such as asynchronous CDMA systems, multipath CDMA channels, and multiuser multiantenna systems. Finally, the issue of non-cooperative power minimization and choice of the spreading code subject to a QoS constraints is also considered, and comparisons with the corresponding cooperative solution are also discussed. Numerical results corroborate the validity of the theoretical analysis, and show that the use of non-linear interference cancellation coupled with waveform adaptation brings remarkable performance gains with respect to linear multiuser receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5407628/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105735","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SINR-maximizing spreading code allocation for non-linear serial interference cancellation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR-maximizing spreading code allocation for non-linear serial interference cancellation","sourcePdf":"631-tc1002-buzzi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057558S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5407629,"authors":[{"name":"Mikko Vehkapera","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland","Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Mikko Vehkaper\u00e4 (S'03) received his M.Sc.

Although the spectral efficiency is maximized if the rates of these codewords are separately controlled, the feedback rate within the link adaptation loop is reduced if they are constrained to be identical. This poses a direct tradeoff between performance and feedback overhead. This paper provides analytical expressions that quantify the difference in spectral efficiency between both approaches for arbitrary numbers of antennas. Specifically, the characterization takes place in the realm of the low- and highpower regimes via expansions that are shown to have a wide range of validity. In addition, the possibility of adjusting the transmit power of each codeword individually is considered as an alternative to the separate control of their rates. Power allocation, however, turns out to be inferior to rate control within the context of this problem.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407630.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Per-antenna rate and power control for MIMO layered architectures in the low- and high-power regimes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407630/","displayDocTitle":"Per-antenna rate and power control for MIMO layered architectures in the low- and high-power regimes","volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105734","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407630/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per-antenna rate and power control for MIMO layered architectures in the low- and high-power regimes","sourcePdf":"652-tc1002-lozano.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095547S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5407632,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Qu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5407594/5407632/5407632-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Qu received the B.S.E degree from the Institute of Communications and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in June, 2002; the M.S. degree (with honors) in electrical and computer engineering, the University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA, May, 2004; and the Ph.D degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, in June 2008.

The LTV channel is modeled by truncated discrete Fourier bases. Based on this model, a two-step approach is adopted to estimate the LTV channel over multiple OFDM symbols. We also present a performance analysis of the channel estimation and derive a closed-form expression for the channel estimation variances. It is shown that the estimation variances, unlike that of the conventional ST-based schemes, approach to a fixed lower-bound as the training length increases, which is directly proportional to information-pilot power ratios. To further enhance the channel estimation performance with a limited pilot power, an interference cancellation procedure is introduced to iteratively mitigate the information sequence interference to channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms frequency-division multiplexed training schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407633.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearly time-varying channel estimation for MIMO/OFDM systems using superimposed training","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-varying channels","MIMO","OFDM","Channel estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Time varying systems","Performance analysis","Closed-form solution","Interference cancellation","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearly time-varying channel estimation","MIMO system","OFDM system","superimposed training","multiple-input multiple-output system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","wireless channel","LTV channel","truncated discrete Fourier","OFDM symbol","estimation variance","interference cancellation","information sequence interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO/OFDM, superimposed training","linearly time-varying channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Linearly time-varying channel estimation for MIMO/OFDM systems using superimposed training","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5407633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11136097","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearly time-varying channel estimation for MIMO/OFDM systems using superimposed training","sourcePdf":"681-tc1002-dai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078193S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5407635,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5407594/5407635/5407635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhang (S'00-M'07) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, California, USA, in 2007.

It is assumed that the CR transmitter is equipped with multi-antennas, whereby transmit precoding and power control can be jointly deployed to balance between avoiding interference at the PR terminals and optimizing performance of the CR link. This operation is named as cognitive beamforming (CB). Unlike prior study on CB that assumes perfect knowledge of the channels over which the CR transmitter interferes with the PR terminals, this paper proposes a practical CB scheme utilizing a new idea of effective interference channel (EIC), which can be efficiently estimated at the CR transmitter from its observed PR signals. Somehow surprisingly, this paper shows that the learning-based CB scheme with the EIC improves the CR channel capacity against the conventional scheme even with the exact CRto- PR channel knowledge, when the PR link is equipped with multi-antennas but only communicates over a subspace of the total available spatial dimensions. Moreover, this paper presents algorithms for the CR to estimate the EIC over a finite learning time. Due to channel estimation errors, the proposed CB scheme causes leakage interference at the PR terminals, which leads to an interesting learning-throughput tradeoff phenomenon for the CR, pertinent to its time allocation between channel learning and data transmission. This paper derives the optimal channel learning time to maximize the effective throughput of the CR link, subject to the CR transmit power constraint and the interference power constraints for the PR terminals.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5407594/05407635.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive beamforming made practical: Effective interference channel and learning-throughput tradeoff","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive beamforming made practical: Effective interference channel and learning-throughput tradeoff","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407635/","publicationDate":"February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11105721","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407635/","volume":"58","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive beamforming made practical: Effective interference channel and learning-throughput tradeoff","sourcePdf":"706-tc1002-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085914S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5407594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5407594","articleId":"5407635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5407689,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Cahn","affiliation":["Beckman Instruments, Inc., South Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lee Cahn","id":"37394556900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-1740"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-1759"}],"articleNumber":"5407689","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407689","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog computers","Instruments","Torque measurement","Phase measurement","Airplanes","Computer errors","Frequency measurement","Voltage","Resistors","Circuits"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IREPGELC.1953.5407689","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the I.R.E.

To determine how accurate the computing components representing a given variable have to be, assume that they constitute one more piece of measuring equipment which must handle the data before it is fed into an ideal computer. 2. In general, the components of an analog computer must have individual accuracies consistent with the measuring equipment available to the group it belongs to. 3. The static accuracy of an operational amplifier may be measured simply by observing the grid voltage in a closed-loop connection as the output is swung through its full range at some low frequency (Fig. 2). Phase shift may be measured simply (Fig. 3), but usually does not play an important part in establishing limits of performance for the computer. 4. Integrator random drift may be measured simply, but is only one cause contributing to integrator error. Account should be taken of the grid deviations measured in the static test above, or else drift measured about a number of non-zero output levels. 5. The effect of integrator drift is to limit the computing time. Required computing time and highest required frequency are determined directly for real-time simulation. In other computing, one may be traded for the other, so long as the product R remains constant. R is the number of cycles of the highest frequency contained in the longest time. Two computers may be compared by comparing their R's; comparing drift rates, computing times, or maximum frequencies alone is not valid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1953","publicationDate":"Dec. 1953","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","volume":"EC-2","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy of an Analog Computer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy of an Analog Computer","sourcePdf":"TIREPG-EC-vEC-2-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030643S","chronDate":"Dec.  1953","isNumber":"5407680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407679","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5407689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5407690,"authors":[{"name":"Louis D.

Boolean expressions for the operation are included. The amount of hardware and the logical delay for a 100-bit ripple-carry adder and a carry-select adder are compared. The adder system described increases the speed of the addition process by reducing the carry-propagation time to the minimum commensurate with economical circuit design. The problem of carry-propagation delay is overcome by independently generating multiple-radix carries and using these carries to select between simultaneously generated sums. In this adder system, the addend and augend are divided into subaddend and subaugend sections that are added twice to produce two subsums. One addition is done with a carry digit forced into each section, and the other addition combines the operands without the forced carry digit.

However, the complexity that accompanies these enormous machines raises challenges for both, users and operators. The effective use of such systems is often hampered by failures encountered when running applications on systems containing tens-of-thousands of nodes and hundreds-of-thousands of compute cores capable of yielding petaflops of performance. In systems of this size failure detection is complicated and root-cause diagnosis difficult. This paper describes our recent work in the identification of anomalies in monitoring data and system logs to provide further insights into machine status, runtime behavior, failure modes and failure root causes. It discusses the details of an initial prototype that gathers the data and uses statistical techniques for analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE International Conference on E-Science Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400052/5407956/05407992.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","publicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE International Conference on E-Science Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ESCIW.2009.5407992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESCIW.2009.5407992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5407956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5407992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric multivariate anomaly analysis in support of HPC resilience","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resilience","Large-scale systems","Condition monitoring","Laboratories","Prototypes","Failure analysis","Scientific computing","Computer science","Mathematics","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","software fault tolerance","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric multivariate anomaly analysis","HPC resilience","large-scale computing systems","size failure detection","root-cause diagnosis","data anomaly monitoring identification","system logs","statistical analysis techniques","high-performance computing systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5407992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric multivariate anomaly analysis in support of HPC resilience","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5407992/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107705","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric multivariate anomaly analysis in support of HPC resilience","confLoc":"Oxford, UK","sourcePdf":"2001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057899S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400052","isNumber":"5407956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400052","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5407956","articleId":"5407992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5408321,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404131400"},{"name":"Xiadan Wang","affiliation":["School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiadan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407463900"},{"name":"Yingdan Mao","affiliation":["School of Resources and Environmental Science, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yingdan","lastName":"Mao","id":"37400106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4914-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4916-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9430"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9449"}],"articleNumber":"5408321","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sustainable development","Artificial neural networks","Industrial relations","Economic indicators","Investments","Predictive models","Standardization","Proposals","Decision making","Local government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","ecology","economics","government policies","grey systems","investment","neural nets","sustainable development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sustainable development","grey relational analysis","artificial neural network","ecological economy","grey relational grade matrix","total population","gross domestic product","total investment","fixed assets","per capita annual living expenditure","urban households","per capita consumption expenditure","rural households","tertiary industry","decision making","policies","standardization transformation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5408321","abstract":"Sustainable development is a hot issue in ecological economy.

Due to specific characteristics of UWSNs, such as high latency, low bandwidth, and high energy consumption, it is challenging to build networking protocols for UWSNs. In this paper, we focus on addressing the routing issue in UWSNs. We propose an adaptive, energy-efficient, and lifetime-aware routing protocol based on reinforcement learning, QELAR. Our protocol assumes generic MAC protocols and aims at prolonging the lifetime of networks by making residual energy of sensor nodes more evenly distributed. The residual energy of each node as well as the energy distribution among a group of nodes is factored in throughout the routing process to calculate the reward function, which aids in selecting the adequate forwarders for packets. We have performed extensive simulations of the proposed protocol on the Aqua-sim platform and compared with one existing routing protocol (VBF) in terms of packet delivery rate, energy efficiency, latency, and lifetime. The results show that QELAR yields 20 percent longer lifetime on average than VBF.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5452156/05408367.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"809","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QELAR: A Machine-Learning-Based Adaptive Routing Protocol for Energy-Efficient and Lifetime-Extended Underwater Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"QELAR: A Machine-Learning-Based Adaptive Routing Protocol for Energy-Efficient and Lifetime-Extended Underwater Sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/5408367/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11256557","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QELAR: A Machine-Learning-Based Adaptive Routing Protocol for Energy-Efficient and Lifetime-Extended Underwater Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2010060796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094365S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5452156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"5452156","articleId":"5408367","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":5408370,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Zahavi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Zahavi","id":"37299269700"},{"name":"Lawrence Eisenberg","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania Energy Center and the Department of Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Eisenberg","id":"37301311400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"5408370","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation economics","Power generation","Air pollution","Thermal pollution","Atmosphere","Power generation dispatch","Cost function","Jacobian matrices","Atmospheric modeling","Power system modeling"]}],"abstract":"A revised dispatch procedure for power is described that meets the demand for energy while accounting for both cost and emission considerations. First, a tradeoff curve, representing all alternative dispatch policies, is derived for each demand level. Since air pollution damage is a function of the spatial distribution of pollutants in the atmosphere, an air pollution diffusion model is utilized in order to evaluate each dispatch policy on the tradeoff curve from an air impact point of view. Under the postulate of rational behavior, the utility function of the decision maker can be described by a quasi-concave function whose maximum point is found among points on the tradeoff curve. An interactive search method, based on the golden section search technique, is then devised in order to guide the decision maker toward finding the dispatch policy that maximizes his utility function.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1975.5408370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/5408369/05408370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1975.5408370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5408369","startPage":"485","endPage":"489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic-Enviromental Power Dispatch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5408370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Economic-Enviromental Power Dispatch","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1975","isJournal":true,"volume":"SMC-5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1975","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic-Enviromental Power Dispatch","sourcePdf":"T-SMC-vSMC-5-n5-1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045699S","chronDate":"Sept.  1975","isNumber":"5408369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"87","articleId":"5408370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5408420,"authors":[{"name":"George M.

This correspondence describes a program that demonstrates the feasibility of segmenting a scene into regions on the basis of velocity. A velocity measure is obtained by determining the amount of displacement of a reference feature between two pictures of the same scene. The pictures are taken only a short time apart so that the reference features can be correlated between the pictures on the basis of spatial position alone. This velocity measurement is associated with absolute reference points superimposed over the scene. It is assumed that all parts of an object have the same velocity measurement. Thus the velocity measurements associated with the reference points provide a means of classifying them as ``belonging'' to the same object. Points ``inside'' moving objects fall into either of two velocity measurement classes, which are easily correlated. Since the velocity of an object is independent of its color, a scene is segmented into regions that contain complete objects even if the objects are not monochromatic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1975","isJournal":true,"volume":"SMC-5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1975","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Velocity as a Cue to Segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Velocity as a Cue to Segmentation","sourcePdf":"T-SMC-vSMC-5-n3-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031029S","chronDate":"May  1975","isNumber":"5408404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5408421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5408453,"authors":[{"name":"Kumpati S.

Furthermore, constraints of weight, cost, and computation time on practical prosthesis application must be satisfied. An approach to the aforementioned recognition problem is given in terms of deriving a fast parametric-recognition algorithm whereby the autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) parameters and the Kalman filter parameters of the EMG time series are identified. It is shown that the resulting identified parameters yield sufficient information to discriminate between a small number of upper extremity functions. Problems involved in practical prosthesis control via the present approach and problems of hardware realization are discussed to illustrate the validity of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional Separation of EMG Signals via ARMA Identification Methods for Prosthesis Control Purposes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1975.5408479","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/5408468/05408479.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1975.5408479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5408468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5408479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1975","displayDocTitle":"Functional Separation of EMG Signals via ARMA Identification Methods for Prosthesis Control Purposes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"SMC-5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional Separation of EMG Signals via ARMA Identification Methods for Prosthesis Control Purposes","sourcePdf":"T-SMC-vSMC-5-n2-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037551S","chronDate":"March  1975","isNumber":"5408468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"253","articleId":"5408479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5408496,"authors":[{"name":"Rex A.

It has three main distinguishing features: 1) use of so-called ``linguistic'' variables in place of or in addition to numerical variables; 2) characterization of simple relations between variables by fuzzy conditional statements; and 3) characterization of complex relations by fuzzy algorithms. A linguistic variable is defined as a variable whose values are sentences in a natural or artificial language. Thus, if tall, not tall, very tall, very very tall, etc. are values of height, then height is a linguistic variable. Fuzzy conditional statements are expressions of the form IF A THEN B, where A and B have fuzzy meaning, e.g., IF x is small THEN y is large, where small and large are viewed as labels of fuzzy sets. A fuzzy algorithm is an ordered sequence of instructions which may contain fuzzy assignment and conditional statements, e.g., x = very small, IF x is small THEN Y is large. The execution of such instructions is governed by the compositional rule of inference and the rule of the preponderant alternative. By relying on the use of linguistic variables and fuzzy algorithms, the approach provides an approximate and yet effective means of describing the behavior of systems which are too complex or too ill-defined to admit of precise mathematical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1973.5408575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1973.5408575","startPage":"28","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/5408568/05408575.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5408568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outline of a New Approach to the Analysis of Complex Systems and Decision Processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1973","displayDocTitle":"Outline of a New Approach to the Analysis of Complex Systems and Decision Processes","volume":"SMC-3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 1973","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outline of a New Approach to the Analysis of Complex Systems and Decision Processes","sourcePdf":"T-SMC-vSMC-3-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029775S","chronDate":"Jan.  1973","isNumber":"5408568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"5503","articleId":"5408575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5408639,"authors":[{"name":"Gopal De","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Gopal","lastName":"De","id":"38180587800"},{"name":"Ashish K.

In the absence of exact knowledge, these quantities may be treated as distance-dependent stationary random processes. However, these distance-dependent random processes enter SINS as time-dependent error sources. The autocorrelation functions of these time functions depend on the manner in which the ship maneuvers. An equation relating the time-dependent autocorrelation function to the distance-dependent autocorrelation function is derived. The time-dependent autocorrelation function is obtained for four different situations. The first two examples are ships steaming at constant heading and constant, but not necessarily known, velocity. The third example involves a ship tracking back and forth over the same path. The last example describes a ship that steams at a constant speed but changes heading in a random manner.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5408677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.1968.5408689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5408677/05408689.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"727","doi":"10.1109/TAES.1968.5408689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Vertical Deflections and Ocean Currents on a Maneuvering Ship","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1968","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Vertical Deflections and Ocean Currents on a Maneuvering Ship","volume":"AES-4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1968","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Vertical Deflections and Ocean Currents on a Maneuvering Ship","sourcePdf":"T-AES-vAES-4-n5-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034092S","chronDate":"Sept.  1968","isNumber":"5408677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5408689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5408763,"authors":[{"name":"Ernest E.

The distinctive features of the extension are the use of the complex notation for wideband signals, and inclusion of the Doppler effect on the signal amplitude. The result is an ambiguity function from which Woodward's form can be found by inspection. It is shown that the well-known volume constraint also applies, in unchanged form, to the generalized ambiguity function. For the volume to be constant, it is not required that the distortions of the modulation function be neglected. Rather, the volume constancy is related to the sinusoidal fluctuations of a modulated carrier-type signal and thus is strictly a matter of the percentage bandwidth of the signal.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.1967.5408847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5408829/05408847.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.1967.5408847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5408829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Doppler Ambiguity Function for Wideband Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5408847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408847/","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Doppler Ambiguity Function for Wideband Signals","volume":"AES-3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Doppler Ambiguity Function for Wideband Signals","sourcePdf":"T-AES-vAES-3-n4-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035079S","chronDate":"July  1967","isNumber":"5408829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"46","articleId":"5408847","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5408931,"authors":[{"name":"Heribert F.

This paper extends the work in several respects. By presenting three-dimensional projections of the conventional ambiguity function of the linear FM signal in more detail than was available before, we can study the sidelobe behavior off as well as on the axes, without weighting, with unilateral weighting in the receiver, and with bilateral weighting. These plots reveal interesting properties related to the signal symmetry in time and frequency. The matched-filter response is then extended to include Doppler distortions of the modulation function. The results show that Woodward's ambiguity function is valid only for signals with relatively modest sophistication, even though in most practical situations one is interested only in those undistorted parts of the matched-filter response in the vicinity of the delay axis. Plots of the response are presented for various degrees of distortion, for signals with and without weighting. Lastly, we consider the effects of a mismatch in range acceleration, again for the various cases of interest. The results convey a thorough insight into the properties of chirp radar under a broad range of operational conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5408997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1968","volume":"AES-4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1968","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Matched-Filter Responses of the Linear FM Waveform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched-Filter Responses of the Linear FM Waveform","sourcePdf":"T-AES-vAES-4-n3-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027941S","chronDate":"May  1968","isNumber":"5408981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5408997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5408999,"authors":[{"name":"Aharon A.

Such a threshold performs better than a fixed threshold that must be set for the highest amplitude clutter. However, the mean-level threshold does not perform as well for stationary noise as a fixed threshold set at the proper value. One measure of effectiveness of an adaptive threshold is its performance in stationary noise (compared to the optimum fixed threshold) for a specified speed of response. For the mean-level threshold, a simple mathematical solution is found for the detection probability when the noise is stationary and the signal scintillates rapidly. The performance is evaluated for a wide range of mean-level-threshold time constants and for several false-alarm probabilities. The results are presented graphically. As an example, the mean-level threshold suffers 3 dB in detectability (equivalent signal-to-noise ratio) in the presence of stationary noise as compared to the optimum fixed threshold for 50-percent probability of detection, false-alarm probability of 10-8, and an adjustment time of 15 times the signal duration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5409011/05409020.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.1968.5409020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.1968.5409020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409011","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection Performance of a Mean-Level Threshold","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler radar","Circuit noise","Radar detection","Performance analysis","Probability","Solid scintillation detectors","Noise level","Signal analysis","Statistical distributions","Radar signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1968","displayDocTitle":"Detection Performance of a Mean-Level Threshold","volume":"AES-4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1968","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection Performance of a Mean-Level Threshold","sourcePdf":"T-AES-vAES-4-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021878S","chronDate":"July  1968","isNumber":"5409011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"55","articleId":"5409020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5409021,"authors":[{"name":"Donald E.

The general model assumes that performance has four components: endurance, strength, skill, and psychological factors. Each of these factors is discussed and ascribed a transfer function. A major problem is the quantification of both training and performance. The case of a swimmer is studied in detail. It is shown that if a time series of training impulses is used as input, his performance in 100 m criterion performances can be modeled rather well with a simple linear system. The major conclusion is that performance appears to be related to the difference between fitness and fatigue functions. The fitness function is related to training by a first-order system with time constant 50 days, whereas the fatigue function is related to training by a similar system with time constant 15 days. An appendix is provided to show how these systems can be simulated on a simple electronic calculator. The relationship of these relatively short-term efects on the individual performer (six months) to longer term effects on the same indiviudal is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1976.5409179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/5409173/05409179.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1976.5409179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systems Model of the Effects of Training on Physical Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1976","displayDocTitle":"A Systems Model of the Effects of Training on Physical Performance","volume":"SMC-6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systems Model of the Effects of Training on Physical Performance","sourcePdf":"T-SMC-vSMC-6-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044336S","chronDate":"Feb.  1976","isNumber":"5409173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"84","articleId":"5409179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5409346,"authors":[{"name":"Bikramaditya Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Bikramaditya","lastName":"Das","id":"37089018905"},{"name":"Susmita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Das","id":"37404265900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4858-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4859-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"5409346","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409346","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband communication","Fingers","Decision feedback equalizers","RAKE receivers","Performance analysis","Fading","Diversity reception","Bit error rate","System performance","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","least mean squares methods","Monte Carlo methods","personal area networks","radio receivers","time-domain analysis","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RAKE-MMSE time domain equalizer","high data rate UWB communication","UWB communication system","ultra wideband communication system","Rake fingers","equalizer taps","RAKE-MMSE receiver","Monte-Carlo simulation","IEEE 802.15.3","UWB channel models"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409342","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAKE-MMSE Time Domain Equalizer for High Data Rate UWB Communication System","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel5/5409246/5409342/05409346.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409346","abstract":"Study on RAKE-MMSE time domain equalizers are attempted for high data rate ultra wideband communication system.

However, most DVC systems are unable to adapt to the bandwidth variations. In this paper we propose a scalable DVC scheme, which can adjust the bit-rate linearly depending on the available bandwidth, and thereby achieves optimal quality of service (QoS). Our algorithm combines compressed sensing with multiple measurement vectors problem to achieve significantly low encoding complexity. The correlation structure in the successive video frames is exploited by joint sparsity, which in turn helps reduce decoding complexity. The simulation results depict a significantly improved performance over other low complexity video codec schemes.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409352","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5409246/5409342/05409352.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Distributed Video Coder Using Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409352/","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Distributed Video Coder Using Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11108087","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409352/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Distributed Video Coder Using Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"pid993362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068706S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5409246","isNumber":"5409342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5409246","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5409342","articleId":"5409352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5409369,"authors":[{"name":"Prashant P.

Generation of each unit is taken as variable. The minimum and maximum generation limits of the units are incorporated with the help of lower and upper bounds of variable. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method is employed to estimate the optimum allocation of generations to different units of plant, making use of the fitness function.

Time and frequency synchronization are very important for the proper signal recovery in the receiver. OFDMA is the extension of OFDM modulation to multi-user application and environments. The difficulties are multiplied if we consider an OFDMA system, where the sub carriers are shared between different users. The receiver has task to establish relationship between channel bandwidth, channel separation and channel sample rate. The receiver also chooses optimal sampling instants and to align the subcarrier frequencies of an OFDM symbol that contain signals form multiple users. The proposed schemes are applicable to adjacent subcarrier permutation OFDMA systems where users are separated in bands of adjacent subcarries. This paper presents the use of Polyphase filter bank in the receiver to simplify the frequency (and timing) synchronization tasks. By using polyphase filter bank the OFDMA synchronization problem is split in to single user OFDM task in very efficient manner. Further in order to achieve low processing load, techniques of multirate signal processing are adopted. MATLAB simulations of 10-, and 50-channel resampling receivers using polyphase filter bank are performed. The computational work load for Polyphase structure is determined and some measures for the reduction of the computational burden are presented.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409377","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5409246/5409342/05409377.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Receiver Architectures for OFDMA Systems Using Polyphase Filter Banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409377/","displayDocTitle":"Digital Receiver Architectures for OFDMA Systems Using Polyphase Filter Banks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11108125","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409377/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Receiver Architectures for OFDMA Systems Using Polyphase Filter Banks","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"pid993266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059702S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5409246","isNumber":"5409342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5409246","xplore-issue":"5409342","articleId":"5409377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5409388,"authors":[{"name":"Amartya Mazumdar","affiliation":["Department of E & ECE, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Amartya","lastName":"Mazumdar","id":"37401536400"},{"name":"Anindya S.

The Matlab simulations show that the complexity has been reduced by 98 percent if the threshold value of PA is around 3.0 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity SLM Technique for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Using Riemann Sequence and Thresholding of Power Amplifier","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409392","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5409246/5409342/05409392.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity SLM Technique for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Using Riemann Sequence and Thresholding of Power Amplifier","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409392/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11108091","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity SLM Technique for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Using Riemann Sequence and Thresholding of Power Amplifier","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"pid993222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048686S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5409246","isNumber":"5409342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5409246","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5409342","articleId":"5409392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5409394,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The pulse radar detection system is simulated using RNN. The results of the simulation are compared with the results obtained from the simulation of pulse radar detection using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network. The number of input layer neurons is same as the length of the signal code and three hidden neurons are taken in the present systems. The Simulation results show that RNN yields better signal-to-sidelobe ratio (SSR) and doppler shift performance than neural network (NN) and some traditional algorithms like auto correlation function (ACF) algorithm. It is also observed that RNN based system converges faster as compared to the MLP based system. Hence the proposed RNN provides an efficient means for pulse radar detection.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409446","pdfPath":"/iel5/5409246/5409342/05409446.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual IEEE India Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2009.5409446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network Approach to Pulse Radar Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network Approach to Pulse Radar Detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11108083","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5409446/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Recurrent Neural Network Approach to Pulse Radar Detection","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"pid993058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037715S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5409246","isNumber":"5409342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5409246","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5409342","articleId":"5409446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5409463,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The preamble is generated by loading the second half of the subcarriers of the preamble with the complex conjugate of the PN (Pseudo random sequence) data loaded onto the first half of the subcarriers in frequency domain. By using the proposed preamble, a frame synchronization method for OFDM systems is described. And, it is shown that the proposed frame synchronization method yields sharp peak at the frame boundary and is independent of carrier frequency offset.

At present, the combination of numerical discretization method with interior point method (IPM) is considered as one of the best algorithms for large-scale TSOPF problems. However, it still suffers from the curse of dimensionality as well as unacceptable computational time and memory consumption. Although the TSOPF problem after numerical discretization is a very large nonlinear programming problem (NLP), its degrees of freedom is relatively small, which makes it very suitable for solution by a reduced-space technique. Considering this characteristic of TSOPF problems, the combination of a reduced-space technique with predictor-corrector IPM is presented in this paper as a way of relieving the computational burden of numerical discretization-based TSOPF algorithms. Several key steps of the reduced-space approach, including building basis matrices, partition strategy, computation of cross term and reduced Hessian, are discussed in detail. Detailed case studies indicate that the proposed reduced-space approach can remarkably reduce both CPU time and memory usage compared to the full-space approach, and therefore is a very promising method for solving large-scale TSOPF problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Power system transients","Large-scale systems","Power system stability","Differential equations","Power generation","Voltage","Reactive power","Rotors","Differential algebraic equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","load flow","nonlinear programming","power system transient stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-space interior point method","transient stability constrained optimal power flow","power system operation","computational complexity","numerical discretization method","nonlinear programming problem","reduced-space technique","predictor-corrector IPM","building basis matrices","partition strategy","reduced Hessian","TSOPF problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interior point method","optimal power flow","reduced-space technique","transient stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2037717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5512898/05409502.pdf","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2037717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reduced-Space Interior Point Method for Transient Stability Constrained Optimal Power Flow","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Reduced-Space Interior Point Method for Transient Stability Constrained Optimal Power Flow","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409502/","volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409502/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11416683","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reduced-Space Interior Point Method for Transient Stability Constrained Optimal Power Flow","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-jquanyuan-2037717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069242S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5512898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5512898","articleId":"5409502","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5409503,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Kang Chien","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","Research and Develop Center, Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5429083/5409503/5409503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Kang Chien received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently with the Research and Develop Center, Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he is involved with analog integrated circuits (ICs) for multimedia.

However, the standard has no formal semantics and different interpretations of the standard have emerged. As a consequence, the execution behavior of applications running on different platforms may exhibit different behavior, thus making it harder to transfer applications between the platforms. This paper shows how three different execution semantics, buffered sequential execution model (BSEM), nonpreempted multithreaded (NPMTR), and cyclic buffered execution model (CBEM) can be mathematically defined. The mathematical definitions can be used to analyze an application's behavior when executed using those execution semantics. The mathematical definitions have been used as a basis for implementation of a runtime environment and a software tool that generates formal models suitable for formal verification. Formal verification can be used to help discover execution errors before the application is executed on the factory floor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

Our approach is composed of two parts: a multistage formulation and a task-parallel algorithm. The formulation utilizes the quasi-separability of the multistage decision making structure, i.e., allowing relaxation by defining the linking variables for adjacent stages of decision making. The task-parallel algorithm enables optimal load balancing of the tasks, and it is validated in the demonstration case where an airline plans to introduce multiple new aircraft to capture dynamically changing travel demand. A linearly increasing computational load is assumed as the number of stages increases due to the complexity added onto the upcoming future stages in the optimization processes. The proposed task parallel algorithm demonstrates significant speedups and parallel performances by utilizing this linearity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2009.2039733","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2009.2039733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5444564/05409524.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel, Multistage Model for Enterprise System Planning and Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallel, Multistage Model for Enterprise System Planning and Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11227833","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5409524/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel, Multistage Model for Enterprise System Planning and Design","sourcePdf":"04jsyst01-hkim-2039733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101937S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5444564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5444564","articleId":"5409524","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5409526,"authors":[{"name":"Mitalkumar G.

Most of the available literature on NCS focuses on only some of these aspects, while ignoring the others. In this paper we present a general framework that incorporates communication constraints, varying transmission intervals and varying delays. Based on a newly developed NCS model including all these network phenomena, we will provide an explicit construction of a continuum of Lyapunov functions. Based on this continuum of Lyapunov functions we will derive bounds on the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) and the maximally allowable delay (MAD) that guarantee stability of the NCS in the presence of communication constraints. The developed theory includes recently improved results for delay-free NCS as a special case. After considering stability, we also study semi-global practical stability (under weaker conditions) and performance of the NCS in terms of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Lp</i>\n gains from disturbance inputs to controlled outputs. The developed results lead to tradeoff curves between MATI, MAD and performance gains that depend on the used protocol.

Unlike the common belief that IDS should be executed as often as possible to cope with insider attacks to prolong the system lifetime, we discover that IDS should be executed at an optimal rate to maximize the mean time to failure of the system. Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used. We develop mathematical models based on Stochastic Petri nets to identify the optimal rate for IDS execution to maximize the mean time to failure of the system, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational conditions, and attacker behaviors.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2010.2040534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5423274/05409536.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2010.2040534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","startPage":"231","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Intrusion Detection on Reliability of Mission-Oriented Mobile Group Systems in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Intrusion Detection on Reliability of Mission-Oriented Mobile Group Systems in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409536/","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5409536/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11152849","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Intrusion Detection on Reliability of Mission-Oriented Mobile Group Systems in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tr-cho-2040534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075841S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"5423274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5423274","articleId":"5409536","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5409537,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Khodaei","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Amin Khodaei received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007.

It discusses the role of hidden Markov models (HMMs) during minimum mean-square error (MMSE) spectral reconstruction. We develop novel HMM-based reconstruction algorithms which exploit intra-channel (across-time) correlation and/or inter-channel (across-frequency) correlation. For the sake of computational efficiency, this paper utilizes approximations to HMM-based decoding methods by developing models constructed from lower resolution quantizers. State configurations for lower resolution models are obtained through a tree-structured mapping of quantizer centroids, and model parameters are adapted accordingly. HMM downsampling avoids expensive retraining of models, and eliminates unnecessary memory requirements. Explicit general formulae are presented for the adaptation of steady-state and transitional statistics. Adaptation of observation statistics are derived from stochastic models of noise spectral magnitude estimation accuracies. The proposed estimation methods are applied in combination with oracle masks, which provide an upper performance bound, as well as masks derived from speech presence probability, which represent a more realistic scenario. Both methods are shown to boost noise robust recognition accuracies significantly relative to the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) baseline system. Furthermore, HMM downsampling greatly reduces the complexity of the HMM-based reconstruction method while negligibly affecting results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473550","htmlLink":"/document/5409542/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HMM-Based Reconstruction of Unreliable Spectrographic Data for Noise Robust Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HMM-Based Reconstruction of Unreliable Spectrographic Data for Noise Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-borgstrom-2038811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080683S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5508665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5508665","articleId":"5409542","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409543,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Suphi Erden","affiliation":["Cognitive Robotics Laboratory, Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques Avancees, Paris, France","Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5441208/5409543/5409543-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mustafa Suphi Erden was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1977.

The human touches the robot and applies force in order to make it behave as he/she likes. The communication between the robot and the human is maintained by a physical contact with no sensors. The intent of the human is estimated by observing the change in control effort. The robot receives the estimated human intent and updates its position reference accordingly. The developed method uses the principle of conservation of zero momentum for position-controlled systems. A switching scheme is developed that goes between the modes of pure impedance control with a fixed-position reference and interactive control under human intent. The switching mechanism uses neither a physical switch nor a sensor; it observes the human intent and puts the robot into interactive mode, if there is any. When the human intent disappears, the robot goes into the pure-impedance-control mode, thus stabilizing in the left position.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Robot control","Robot sensing systems","Human robot interaction","Force sensors","Communication system control","Switches","Manipulators","Humanoid robots","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","manipulators","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-intent detection","physically interactive control","manipulator robot arm","estimated human intent","position reference","position-controlled systems","switching scheme","impedance control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human\u2013robot interaction","impedance control","intention detection","interactive control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409543","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2010.2040202","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5441208/05409543.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2010.2040202","startPage":"370","endPage":"382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-Intent Detection and Physically Interactive Control of a Robot Without Force Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Human-Intent Detection and Physically Interactive Control of a Robot Without Force Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409543/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5409543/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208035","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-Intent Detection and Physically Interactive Control of a Robot Without Force Sensors","sourcePdf":"tro-erden-2040202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105932S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5441208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5441208","articleId":"5409543","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5409545,"authors":[{"name":"Somnath Paul","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6195043/5409545/5409545-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Somnath Paul (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2005.

To address some of the design challenges in molecular crossbar, we propose \u201cmemory-based architecture for reconfigurable computing\u201d (MBARC), where memory, instead of switch-based logic functions, is used as the computing element. MBARC leverages on the fact that regular and periodic structures of molecular crossbar are attractive for a dense memory design. The main idea in MBARC is to partition a logic circuit, store the partitions as multi-input-multi-output lookup tables in a memory array, and then, use a simple CMOS-based scheduler to evaluate the partitions in a topological time-multiplexed manner. Compared to existing reconfigurable nanocomputing models, the proposed memory-based computing has three major advantages: 1) it minimizes the requirement of programmable interconnects (PIs); 2) it minimizes the number of CMOS interfacing elements that are required for level restoration and cascading logic blocks; and 3) it can achieve higher defect tolerance through efficient use of redundancy. Simulation results for a set of ISCAS benchmarks show average improvement of 32% in area, 21% in delay, and 34% in energy per vector compared to the implementation of a nanoscale field-programmable gate array. Effectiveness of the framework is also studied for two large sequential circuits, namely, 2-D discrete cosine transform and eight-tap finite-impulse-response filter.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2010.2041556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6195043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2010.2041556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6195043/05409545.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Memory-Based Reconfigurable Computing Framework for Nanoscale Crossbar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Memory-Based Reconfigurable Computing Framework for Nanoscale Crossbar","volume":"11","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409545/","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12711807","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409545/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Memory-Based Reconfigurable Computing Framework for Nanoscale Crossbar","sourcePdf":"tnano-paul-2041556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092593S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6195043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6195043","articleId":"5409545","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5409547,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Defay","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l'A\u00e9ronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE)-SUPAERO, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5483249/5409547/5409547-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fran\u00e7ois Defa\u00ff received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, in 2003 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, Toulouse, France, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","He joined the Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019A\u00e9ronautique et de l\u2019Espace (ISAE)\u2014SUPAERO, Toulouse, which is an aerospace engineering school, as a Research Engineer in 2009."]},"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Defay","id":"37397666100"},{"name":"Ana-Maria Llor","affiliation":["Laboratory on Plasma and Conversion of Energy (LAPLACE), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5483249/5409547/5409547-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ana-Maria Llor (M\u201908) received the M.S. degree from the Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree from the Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es, Lyon, France, in 2003.","She joined the Laboratory on Plasma and Conversion of Energy (LAPLACE) (formerly Laboratoire d\u2019Electrotechnique et d\u2019Electronique Industrielle until January 2007), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France, as an Assistant Professor in 2005.

This paper presents the design flow and confirms the feasibility of the approach by means of hardware-in-the-loop simulations and experimental tests.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5599338/05409549.pdf","startPage":"3822","endPage":"3829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2039459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2039459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System-on-Chip Sensorless Control for a Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Sensorless control","Permanent magnet motors","Finite impulse response filter","Field programmable gate arrays","Magnetic separation","Phase estimation","Phase detection","Commutation","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commutation","computerised control","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","permanent magnet motors","position control","sensorless machine control","synchronous motors","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip sensorless control","system-on-programmable-chip","permanent-magnet synchronous motor","position sensorless control","field-programmable gate-array","finite-impulse response filters","phase compensation","commutation signals","hardware-in-the-loop simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","finite-impulse response (FIR) filters","permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs)","sensorless control","sliding-mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"A System-on-Chip Sensorless Control for a Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5409549/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11579609","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System-on-Chip Sensorless Control for a Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor","sourcePdf":"tie-dellicolli-2039459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066169S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5599338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5599338","articleId":"5409549","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409550,"authors":[{"name":"Di He","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5409550/5409550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Di He (S\u201900\u2013M\u201904) received the B.E. degree in information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1996, the M.E. degree in communications and information systems from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in circuits and systems from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.","From 2002 to 2004, he was with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

Although industrial efforts have been made to design efficient embedded memory arrays using STTRAM, the prospect of developing a nonvolatile field-programmable gate array (FPGA) framework with STTRAM exploiting its high integration density remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CMOS-STTRAM hybrid FPGA framework, identify the key design challenges, and propose optimization techniques at circuit, architecture, and application mapping levels. We show that intrinsic properties of STTRAM that distinguish it from conventional static RAM (SRAM), such as asymmetric readout power, where a cell storing \u201c0\u201d has 5\u00d7 less read power than a cell storing \u201c1\u201d, can be leveraged to skew lookup table contents for FPGA power reduction. We also argue that the proposed framework should operate on static voltage-sensing-based logic evaluation. We identify static power dissipation during logic evaluation and read noise margin as key design concerns and present an optimized resistor-divider design for voltage sensing to reduce static power and noise margin. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of Shannon-decomposition-based supply gating to reduce static power. Simulation results show improvement of 44.39% in logic area and 22.28% in delay of a configurable logic block (CLB) and average improvement of 16.1% dynamic power over a conventional CMOS FPGA design for a set of benchmark circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2010.2041555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5764947/05409553.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2010.2041555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Circuit and Architecture Codesign Approach for a Hybrid CMOS\u2013STTRAM Nonvolatile FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Circuit and Architecture Codesign Approach for a Hybrid CMOS\u2013STTRAM Nonvolatile FPGA","volume":"10","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988316","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409553/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409553/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Circuit and Architecture Codesign Approach for a Hybrid CMOS\u2013STTRAM Nonvolatile FPGA","sourcePdf":"tnano-paul-2041555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108328S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5764947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5764947","articleId":"5409553","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5409557,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Heung Park","affiliation":["Institute of Micro Electronics, Electromagnetism and Photonics, Minatec National Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5419130/5409557/5409557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ki-Heung Park received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Hongik University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Institute of Microelectronics, Electromagnetism and Photonics (IMEP), Minatec-National Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble (INPG), Grenoble, France.

We investigated the effect of the NVM functionality on 1T-DRAM performance in nanoscale 1T-DRAM cells through device simulation and verified the effect in 0.6-\u00bfm devices fabricated on SOI wafers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409557/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","volume":"57","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11142383","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5409557/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Novel Double-Gate 1T-DRAM Cell Using Nonvolatile Memory Functionality for High-Performance and Highly Scalable Embedded DRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Double-Gate 1T-DRAM Cell Using Nonvolatile Memory Functionality for High-Performance and Highly Scalable Embedded DRAMs","sourcePdf":"ted-lee-2038650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068788S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5419130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5419130","articleId":"5409557","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5409558,"authors":[{"name":"Dragica Vasileska","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5419130/5409558/5409558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dragica Vasileska received the B.S.E.E.

It is proved that, when CI codes are used, each user only needs to combat 2(L - 1) (rather than N - 1) interferers, even in the presence of CFO. It is shown that this property of MC-CDMA with CI codes in a CFO channel can be exploited to simplify three multiuser detectors, namely, parallel interference cancellation (PIC), maximum-likelihood, and decorrelating multiuser detectors. The bit-error probability (BEP) for MC-CDMA with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and single-stage PIC and an upper bound for the minimum error probability are derived.

However, to realize the CR concept, it is essential to provide enough incentives to PRNs and extra revenue to the service provider such that CR mobile stations (CR-MSs) may accordingly utilize PRN spectrum bands, which provides a new challenge for spectrum management. In this paper, we consider a PRN consisting of a primary system base station (PS-BS) and multiple primary system mobile stations (PS-MSs), and we, therefore, construct a CR network (CRN) consisting of a PRN with multiple CR-MSs. We propose a spectrum-management policy framework based on the Vickrey auction such that CR-MSs can compete for utilization of the PRN spectrum bands available for opportunistic transmission of CR-MSs. PRN users are granted incentives at a discounting factor to access spectrum bands and are being compensated for possible operating interference from CR-MSs, whereas the interference is constrained under a tolerance level without losing satisfaction for the PS-MSs. Once CR-MSs are granted spectrum bands, they can utilize the spectrum bands for a certain duration with no spectrum handoff. Consequently, in addition to incentives to the PRN, the overall spectrum utilization, the profit of the service provider, and the opportunity to access the spectrum for the CR-MSs are enhanced to achieve a co-win situation for every involved party in CRNs. Realistic simulations by incorporating pretty bad channel conditions into system operations show the robust operation of our proposed system, which enables the CR concept.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2042474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05409561.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2042474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auction-Based Spectrum Management of Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Auction-Based Spectrum Management of Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285979","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5409561/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auction-Based Spectrum Management of Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2042474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110554S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5409561","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409563,"authors":[{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lie-Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441800"},{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37276965400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5409563","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This correspondence motivates simple and accurate evaluation of the error probability of multiantenna multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems using optimum linear combining (OLC).

The performance examples show that the error probability evaluated using the derived formulas is accurate and usually indistinguishable from that obtained by simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05409563.pdf","startPage":"2098","endPage":"2103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2042628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2042628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple and Accurate Error Probability Evaluation of Multiple-Input\u2013Multiple-Output Systems Using Optimum Linear Combining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Diversity reception","MIMO","Multiuser detection","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Random variables","Nonlinear distortion","Signal to noise ratio","Radiofrequency interference","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","error statistics","gamma distribution","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability evaluation","optimum linear combining","multiantenna multiple-input-multiple-output systems","first-order statistics","second-order statistics","eigenvalues","order-2 approximation approach","gamma-distributed random variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital modulation","maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR)","minimum mean-square error (MMSE)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","optimum linear combining (OLC)","Rayleigh fading","space-division multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Simple and Accurate Error Probability Evaluation of Multiple-Input\u2013Multiple-Output Systems Using Optimum Linear Combining","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5409563/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285976","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple and Accurate Error Probability Evaluation of Multiple-Input\u2013Multiple-Output Systems Using Optimum Linear Combining","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2042628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066387S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5409563","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409566,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Sarbandi Farahani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein Sarbandi","lastName":"Farahani","id":"37402513900"},{"name":"Mehdi Veysi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Veysi","id":"37392011200"},{"name":"Manouchehr Kamyab","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Manouchehr","lastName":"Kamyab","id":"37300004100"},{"name":"Alireza Tadjalli","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Tadjalli","id":"37275336900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5409566","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":197,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":6328},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Reducing mutual coupling between elements of an antenna array is one of the main topics in array designs. The use of electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures built by microstrip technology is an attractive way to mitigate the mutual coupling problem. This letter describes a novel configuration of uniplanar compact electromagnetic band-gap (UC-EBG) structures to reduce mutual coupling between the radiating elements. The idea is to use the UC-EBG structures placed on top of the antenna layer. The main objective is to reduce both the element separation and the mutual coupling between the patch antennas, which in turn increases antenna directivity. The proposed configuration eliminates drawbacks of similar structures presented in previous works.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5423326/05409566.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2010.2042565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2010.2042565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Coupling Reduction in Patch Antenna Arrays Using a UC-EBG Superstrate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual coupling","Patch antennas","Antenna arrays","Periodic structures","Microstrip antenna arrays","Metamaterials","Microstrip antennas","Insulation","Bandwidth","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","directive antennas","electromagnetic coupling","microstrip antennas","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual coupling reduction","patch antenna arrays","UC-EBG superstate","microstrip technology","uniplanar compact electromagnetic band-gap structures","antenna directivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna miniaturization","mutual coupling reduction","patch antenna array","uniplar compact electromagnetic band-gap (UC-EBG) superstrate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Coupling Reduction in Patch Antenna Arrays Using a UC-EBG Superstrate","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5409566/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2010","accessionNumber":"11156347","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Coupling Reduction in Patch Antenna Arrays Using a UC-EBG Superstrate","sourcePdf":"lawp-hfarahani-2042565.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099453S","chronDate":"2010","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5423326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"5423326","articleId":"5409566","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5409567,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitri Vinnikov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5662271/5409567/5409567-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dmitri Vinnikov (M'07) received the Dipl.Eng., M.Sc., and Dr.Sc.techn. degrees in electrical engineering from Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia, in 1999, 2001, and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Researcher with the Department of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics, Tallinn University of Technology.

From this model, the space-time correlation function is derived for a 3-D nonisotropic scattering environment. The statistical properties of the reference model are analytically studied in terms of various parameters such as the elevation angle of the platform, the array configuration, the Doppler spread, and the distribution of the scatterers. Using the theoretical expressions, one can easily numerically evaluate the HAP antenna interelement spacing required to achieve uncorrelated responses in the HAP-MIMO channel matrix. The proposed model provides guidelines for the system design and performance analysis of HAP-MIMO communication systems with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) connections at the L and S frequency bands.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2042629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05409569.pdf","startPage":"2232","endPage":"2242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2042629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional HAP-MIMO Channels: Modeling and Analysis of Space-Time Correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional HAP-MIMO Channels: Modeling and Analysis of Space-Time Correlation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409569/","publicationDate":"Jun 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11392336","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409569/","volume":"59","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional HAP-MIMO Channels: Modeling and Analysis of Space-Time Correlation","sourcePdf":"tvt-kanatas-2042629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079603S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5409569","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5409576,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Henrique da Silva","affiliation":["Itajub\u00e1 Federal University, Itajub\u00e1-MG, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5599338/5409576/5409576-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos Henrique da Silva was born in Jo\u00e3o Monlevade, Brazil, in 1977.

The developed MSRF-PLL is fast in transient response compared to standard PLL technique. The performance is robust against disturbances on the grid, voltage wave with harmonic distortion, and noise. The proposed algorithm has been analyzed in detail and was fully implemented digitally using digital signal processor TMS320F2812. The experimental evaluation of the MSRF-PLL in a shunt active power filter confirms its fast dynamic response, noise immunity, and applicability.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2040554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5599338/05409576.pdf","startPage":"3814","endPage":"3821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2040554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital PLL Scheme for Three-Phase System Using Modified Synchronous Reference Frame","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409576/","displayDocTitle":"A Digital PLL Scheme for Three-Phase System Using Modified Synchronous Reference Frame","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11579591","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409576/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digital PLL Scheme for Three-Phase System Using Modified Synchronous Reference Frame","sourcePdf":"tie-dasilva-2040554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086025S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5599338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5599338","articleId":"5409576","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409578,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A process combining anisotropic and isotropic etching was utilized to form the 3-D silicon-tip array whose shape was transferred to the Parylene C film as a flexible and biocompatible substrate. Platinum was chosen as the electrode material owing to its high charge delivery capacity and chemical inertness in the physiological environment. An aluminum-photoresist dual-layer lift-off process was employed for platinum patterning on the substrate with high tips. To avoid the cracking problem existing in the platinum-Parylene C structure, a gold intermediate layer was introduced to retard the tendency. To test the superiority of the present 3-D flexible MEA compared with the planar one, electrical properties of MEAs were characterized both \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vitro</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i>\n.

The increasing interest on microgrids is caused by the considerable growth of renewable energy sources (RES) and distributed generation (DG). In a large geographical region, there can exist multiple microgrids. Many academic articles have reported the technicalities of microgrids operating in islanded mode, and few have analyzed their aggregated technical/economic impacts or benefits on the network in a larger region. Deregulation encourages RES to participate in energy markets to facilitate competition among different energy providers. Apart from participating in energy markets, an alternative way of making use of and making profit out of multiple microgrids is to take part in the ancillary-service market. This paper investigates the technical aspects of providing frequency control reserves (FCRs) and the potential economic profitability of participating in FCR markets based on a setup of multiple microgrids. In particular, it has a focus on the communication aspects under different market scenarios, i.e., decentralized or centralized coordination approach, for FCRs with the assumption of the possible aggregation of reserve provision from multiple microgrids (microsources and flexible loads).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5662271/05409587.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2041139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2041139","startPage":"173","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Provision of Frequency Control Reserves From Multiple Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409587/","displayDocTitle":"The Provision of Frequency Control Reserves From Multiple Microgrids","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409587/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11692742","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Provision of Frequency Control Reserves From Multiple Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tie-yuen-2041139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071751S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5662271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"5662271","articleId":"5409587","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5409588,"authors":[{"name":"Saad Sayeef","affiliation":["University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5599338/5409588/5409588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saad Sayeef (S'03\u2013M'08) received the B.E. degree (first-class honor) in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Auckland, Auckland City, New Zealand, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2009.","He was an Electronics Design Engineer with Fisher and Paykel Appliances, Ltd., Auckland City, until 2004.

The changeover between these two algorithms is performed using a weighting function which smoothly hands over the estimated rotor position information for stator flux and torque estimation purposes. Experiments were performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed HF signal injection algorithm, and results show that the sensorless drive is capable of accurately estimating the position and speed at very low speeds including standstill.

Surface EMG signals were recorded with electrode grids from the tibialis anterior, biceps brachii, and abductor digiti minimi muscles of twelve healthy men during isometric contractions ranging between 5% and 20% of the maximal force. Bipolar intramuscular EMG signals were recorded with pairs of wire electrodes. Surface and intramuscular EMG were independently decomposed into motor unit spike trains. When averaged over all the contractions of the same contraction force, the percentage of discharge times of motor units identified by both decompositions varied in the ranges 84%-87% (tibialis anterior), 84%-86% (biceps brachii), and 87%-92% (abductor digiti minimi) across the force levels analyzed.

Offset calibration is achieved by digitally adjusting the bulk voltages of the preamplifier input devices. Without introducing additional capacitive loading in the analog path, this technique improves the accuracy of flash ADCs while not impairing their high-speed performance. A 4-bit ADC in 90-nm CMOS with the proposed technique achieves 3.71 effective number of bits (ENOB) at 5-GS/s sampling rate with 2.5-GHz effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW). The calibration generally improves ENOB by approximately 0.5 bit after calibration. The ADC consumes 86 mW at 5 GS/s with a 2.5-GHz input achieving a 1.32-pJ/convstep figure of merit.

Moreover, low-cost 3-D imaging has the potential to open a wide field of additional applications and solutions in markets such as consumer electronics, multimedia, digital photography, robotics, and medical technologies. This paper focuses on the currently implemented phase-shift algorithm in this type of sensors.

Solving a nonlinear transcendental equation set describing the harmonic-elimination problem with nonequal dc sources reaches the limitation of contemporary computer algebra software tools using the resultant method. The proposed approach in this paper can be applied to solve the problem in a simpler manner, even when the number of switching angles is increased and the determination of these angles using the resultant theory approach is not possible. Theoretical results are verified by experiments and simulations for an 11-level H-bridge inverter. Results show that the proposed method does effectively eliminate a great number of specific harmonics, and the output voltage is resulted in low total harmonic distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11579581","htmlLink":"/document/5409602/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Elimination of Cascade Multilevel Inverters with Nonequal DC Sources Using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Elimination of Cascade Multilevel Inverters with Nonequal DC Sources Using Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tie-tarafdarhagh-2041736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051857S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5599338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"5599338","articleId":"5409602","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409604,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Niewiadomski","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"bio":{"p":["Adam Niewiadomski received the M.Sc. degree from the Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, in 1998 and the Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees from the Polish Academy of Science, Warsaw, Poland, in 2001 and 2009, respectively, all in computer science.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Institute of Information Technology, Technical University of Lodz.

Hence, we have implicitly assumed and considered linguistic expressions represented by sets in discrete (or even finite) universes of discourse. Now, in this paper, we discuss more thoroughly some of the properties and formal aspects of both discrete and continuous type-2 fuzzy sets that represent the elements of linguistic summaries, i.e., quantifiers, summarizers, and/or qualifiers. We underline differences between type-2 fuzzy sets in finite and in infinite (usually continuous) universes of discourse and, henceforth, between their cardinalities and similar measures, which are used in evaluating the goodness (quality) of type-2 linguistic summaries. In addition, we define new imprecision measures of linguistic expressions represented by type-2 fuzzy sets, and propose a definition of the cylindric extension of a type-2 fuzzy set.

A methodology is developed to generate the trigger signals for various IGBTs used in frequency converters such that the circuit is not restricted to a particular value of output frequency but it can produce any output frequency that is an integer multiple of the input supply frequency. The output of the converter has been improved using delta-modulation technique. Hardware design is obtained using readily available ICs and other components.

However, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, SVMs produce suboptimal classification models. On the other hand, the SVM algorithm is sensitive to outliers and noise present in the datasets. Therefore, although the existing class imbalance learning (CIL) methods can make SVMs less sensitive to class imbalance, they can still suffer from the problem of outliers and noise. Fuzzy SVMs (FSVMs) is a variant of the SVM algorithm, which has been proposed to handle the problem of outliers and noise. In FSVMs, training examples are assigned different fuzzy-membership values based on their importance, and these membership values are incorporated into the SVM learning algorithm to make it less sensitive to outliers and noise. However, like the normal SVM algorithm, FSVMs can also suffer from the problem of class imbalance. In this paper, we present a method to improve FSVMs for CIL (called FSVM-CIL), which can be used to handle the class imbalance problem in the presence of outliers and noise. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed FSVM-CIL method on ten real-world imbalanced datasets and compared its performance with five existing CIL methods, which are available for normal SVM training. Based on the overall results, we can conclude that the proposed FSVM-CIL method is a very effective method for CIL, especially in the presence of outliers and noise in datasets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2042721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5475389/05409611.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"571","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2042721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FSVM-CIL: Fuzzy Support Vector Machines for Class Imbalance Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"FSVM-CIL: Fuzzy Support Vector Machines for Class Imbalance Learning","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5409611/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328222","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FSVM-CIL: Fuzzy Support Vector Machines for Class Imbalance Learning","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-palade-2042721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142409S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5475389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"5475389","articleId":"5409611","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5409615,"authors":[{"name":"Patricio Cort\u00e9s","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria, Valpara\u00edso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5508599/5409615/5409615-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patricio Cort\u00e9s (S'05\u2013M'08) received the Engineer and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering from the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Valpara\u00edso, Chile, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree from UTFSM in 2008.","In 2003, he joined the Electronics Engineering Department, UTFSM, where he is currently a Research Associate.

This control method uses a discrete-time model of the system to predict the future value of the current for all voltage vectors, and selects the vector which minimizes a cost function. Due to the large number of voltage vectors available in a multilevel inverter, a large number of calculations are needed, making difficult the implementation of this control in a standard control platform. A modified control strategy that considerably reduces the amount of calculations without affecting the system's performance is proposed.

The proposed technique is based on the integral resonant control (IRC) scheme. The controller consists of two nested feedback loops. The inner loop controls the joint angle and makes the system robust to joint friction. The outer loop, which is based on the IRC technique, damps the vibration and makes the system robust to the unmodeled dynamics (spill-over) and resonance frequency variations due to changes in the payload. The objectives of this work are: 1) to demonstrate the advantages of IRC, which is a high-performance controller design methodology for flexible structures with collocated actuator-sensor pairs and 2) to illustrate its capability of achieving precise end-point (tip) positioning with effective vibration suppression when applied to a typical flexible manipulator. The theoretical formulation of the proposed control scheme, a detailed stability analysis and experimental results obtained on a flexible manipulator are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2039713","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5689345/05409635.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2039713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integral Resonant Control for Vibration Damping and Precise Tip-Positioning of a Single-Link Flexible Manipulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409635/","displayDocTitle":"Integral Resonant Control for Vibration Damping and Precise Tip-Positioning of a Single-Link Flexible Manipulator","volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11759271","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409635/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integral Resonant Control for Vibration Damping and Precise Tip-Positioning of a Single-Link Flexible Manipulator","sourcePdf":"tmech-pereira-2039713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102796S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5689345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5689345","articleId":"5409635","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409638,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin J.

A challenge of synchronization is how to fast and precisely extract the fundamental positive and negative sequences under the distorted and unbalanced conditions. Many phase-locked loop (PLL) and synchronization techniques have been presented in the past decades. Most of them make a tradeoff between the accuracy and dynamic response under severe distorted and unbalanced conditions. In this paper, a multiple-complex coefficient-filter-based PLL is presented, and its unique feature lies in the accurate and rapid extraction of the positive and negative sequence components from the polluted grid voltage, and the harmonic components can also be estimated precisely, which has the potential use for selective compensation in active filter applications. Another advantage of the proposed method is its flexibility for simplifying its structure in some specified conditions. Results of continuous-domain simulations in MATLAB and discrete-domain experiments based on a 32-b fixed-point TMS320F2812 DSP are in good agreement, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5727983/05409639.pdf","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2041738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2041738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5727983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Complex Coefficient-Filter-Based Phase-Locked Loop and Synchronization Technique for Three-Phase Grid-Interfaced Converters in Distributed Utility Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Power harmonic filters","Voltage","Active filters","Harmonic distortion","Permission","Motor drives","Power supplies","Bandwidth","Pollution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","digital signal processing chips","distribution networks","dynamic response","phase locked loops","power convertors","power filters","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple complex coefficient filter","phase locked loop","synchronization technique","three-phase grid interfaced converter","distributed utility networks","dynamic response","polluted grid voltage","harmonic components","active filter applications","continuous domain simulation","MATLAB","discrete domain experiment","32-b fixed point TMS320F2812 DSP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple complex-coefficient filters (MCCFs)","phase-locked loop (PLL)","synchronization","three-phase grid-interfaced converters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Complex Coefficient-Filter-Based Phase-Locked Loop and Synchronization Technique for Three-Phase Grid-Interfaced Converters in Distributed Utility Networks","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5409639/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11862370","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Complex Coefficient-Filter-Based Phase-Locked Loop and Synchronization Technique for Three-Phase Grid-Interfaced Converters in Distributed Utility Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-guo-2041738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072422S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5727983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"305","xplore-issue":"5727983","articleId":"5409639","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409640,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan B.

It is shown that the introduced and amplified quantization noise degrades sliding motion into the quasi-sliding mode and threatens to provoke chattering. Furthermore, a new DSM control algorithm is proposed, featuring a two-scale reaching law and a supplemental integral action. This algorithm avoids chattering and provides excellent performance. The developed DSM controller has been experimentally tested in an induction motor position control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Discrete-Time Sliding-Mode Position Control Using Euler Velocity Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2042416","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5599338/05409645.pdf","startPage":"3840","endPage":"3847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2042416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Improved Discrete-Time Sliding-Mode Position Control Using Euler Velocity Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5409645/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11579602","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Discrete-Time Sliding-Mode Position Control Using Euler Velocity Estimation","sourcePdf":"tie-veselic-2042416-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063722S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5599338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5599338","articleId":"5409645","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5409646,"authors":[{"name":"ZhenQi Chen","affiliation":["Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5446457/5409646/5409646-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["ZhenQi Chen (S\u201902) was born in Beijing, China, in 1978.

Although IEEE 802.15.4 provides a superframe structure for real-time communication, a real-time message-scheduling algorithm is still required to schedule a large number of real-time messages to meet their timing constraints. We propose a distance-constrained real-time offline message-scheduling algorithm which generates the standard specific parameters such as beacon order, superframe order, and guaranteed-time-slot information and allocates each periodic real-time message to superframe slots for a given message set. The proposed scheduling algorithm is evaluated and analyzed extensively through simulations. In addition, a guaranteed time service is implemented in a typical industrial sensor node platform with a well-known IEEE 802.15.4-compliant transceiver CC2420 and ATmega128L to verify the feasibility of the guaranteed time service with the schedule generated by the proposed scheduling algorithm. Through experiments, we prove that the real system runs accurately according to the schedule calculated by the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2040630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599338","startPage":"3868","endPage":"3876","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5599338/05409648.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2040630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guaranteeing Real-Time Services for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks With IEEE 802.15.4","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Scheduling algorithm","Job shop scheduling","Application software","Communication industry","Wireless communication","Intelligent sensors","Manufacturing automation","Materials science and technology","Permission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic messaging","transceivers","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial wireless sensor networks","real time communication services","distance constrained real time offline message scheduling algorithm","standard specific parameters","guaranteed time slot information","periodic real time message","industrial sensor node platform","IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceiver CC2420"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Guaranteed time slot (GTS)","industrial wireless sensor network (WSN)","real-time communication","WSN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Guaranteeing Real-Time Services for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks With IEEE 802.15.4","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409648/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5409648/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11579604","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guaranteeing Real-Time Services for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks With IEEE 802.15.4","sourcePdf":"tie-yoo-2040630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105945S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5599338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5599338","articleId":"5409648","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5409651,"authors":[{"name":"Gonzalo Farias","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automatic Control, Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5567234/5409651/5409651-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gonzalo Farias received the M.S. degree in computer science from the University de la Frontera, Temuco, Chile, in 2001.","Since 2005, he has been with the Department of Computer Science and Automatic Control, Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia, Madrid, Spain.

Direct-driven configuration with PMSG is an attractive choice for WECS because of the gearbox elimination and cost reduction due to small pole-pitch design. However, speed and torsional oscillations appear when the generator is directly connected to the wind turbine without any assistant damping device. Based on small-signal analysis, a low-bandwidth design for the power or generator torque controller of PMSG can help to reduce the oscillation amplitude, but the system dynamic performance is thus sacrificed. From the power-flow's point of view, the oscillation is reflected in the dc-link current. With the help of switch function modeling based on the space-vector-modulation scheme, the average dc-link current can be estimated and applied to the compensation strategy, which provides positive damping resulting in stability improvement. The simulation and experiment results verify the theoretical analysis and the validation of the proposed strategy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5727983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2040568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5727983/05409665.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1119","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2040568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Damping for PMSG-Based WECS With DC-Link Current Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Active Damping for PMSG-Based WECS With DC-Link Current Estimation","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5409665/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11862371","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Damping for PMSG-Based WECS With DC-Link Current Estimation","sourcePdf":"tie-geng-2040568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069846S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5727983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5727983","articleId":"5409665","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5409666,"authors":[{"name":"Junming Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5491380/5409666/5409666-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junming Zhang (M'10) was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1975.

Dispersion compensation is achieved by splitting the input signal between two dispersive media and adding the resulting signals thereafter. Tunable compensation is attained by controlling the power splitting ratio of the input signal between both dispersive media. The frequency response of the TODC is theoretically assessed considering signal addition in the optical and electrical domains. The latter case is enabled by using optical single sideband (OSSB) modulation, which allows preserving the phase information of dispersive media output signals after direct detection. This is the only case experimentally tested, since it avoids stability problems related with coherent addition of optical signals. A TODC with a tuning range of -340 to 0 ps/nm was designed and experimentally assessed for a 40 Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero OSSB signal. The tunable power splitter consisted of an automatic polarization controller and a polarization beam splitter, which offered a tuning time lower than 150 \u00bfs.

It provides a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than the conventional diffuse system (CDS), but its SNR can be degraded due to shadowing, signal blockage and mobility. Three methods: imaging reception, beam angle and beam power adaptation are introduced to the design of spot-diffusing OW systems to effectively mitigate the degradation due to mobility in the presence of ambient light noise, multipath propagation, and shadowing. The performance of our systems was evaluated through channel and noise modeling. The CDS SNR performance improves by more than 20 dB when an imaging receiver with maximum ratio combining (MRC) replaces a non-imaging receiver. A 24 dB SNR gain can be achieved when spot-diffusing is employed with an imaging MRC receiver instead of the imaging MRC CDS. In an imaging spot-diffusing system, the SNR is independent of the transmitter position and can be maximized at all receiver locations when our new methods (beam angle and beam power adaptation) are implemented. Regardless of the transmitter position, beam angle adaptation can target the spots at the optimum location that yields the best SNR at the receiver. A significant SNR improvement of 36 dB in the imaging spot-diffusing performance can be achieved when angle adaptation is introduced. Further SNR improvement of 4 dB can be obtained if the power is adaptively distributed among the spots. Furthermore, an increase in the channel bandwidth from 43 MHz (non-imaging CDS) to 8.19 GHz can be achieved through the combination of these methods (imaging reception, spot-diffusing, beam angle and beam power adaptation). The increase in channel bandwidth and SNR can enable the OW system to achieve higher data rates and 2.5 Gbit/s and 5 Gbit/s mobile OW systems are shown to be feasible. The results also prove that the influence of shadowing and signal blockage can be sufficiently combated through the use of these methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Spot Diffusing Mobile Optical Wireless System Employing Beam Angle and Power Adaptation and Imaging Receivers","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2042140","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5524641/05409675.pdf","startPage":"2191","endPage":"2206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2042140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2010","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Spot Diffusing Mobile Optical Wireless System Employing Beam Angle and Power Adaptation and Imaging Receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/5409675/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11450042","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Spot Diffusing Mobile Optical Wireless System Employing Beam Angle and Power Adaptation and Imaging Receivers","sourcePdf":"jlt-falsaadi-2042140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073267S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5524641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5524641","articleId":"5409675","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5409677,"authors":[{"name":"Wenke Lu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5599338/5409677/5409677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenke Lu was born in 1962.

The proposed variable frequency duty cycle (VFDC) control is intended to improve the efficiency in the medium and low output power levels because of the decreased switching frequencies. The study performed in this letter includes, in a first step, a theoretical analysis of power balance as a function of control parameters. In addition, restrictions due to snubber capacitors and deadtime, and variability of the loads have been considered. Afterward, an efficiency analysis has been carried out to determine the optimum operation point. Switching and conduction losses have been calculated to examine the overall efficiency improvement. VFDC strategy efficiency improvement is achieved by means of a switching-frequency reduction, mainly at low-medium power range, and with low-quality factor loads. Domestic induction heating application is suitable for the use of VFDC strategy due to its special load characteristics. For this reason, the simulation results have been validated using an induction heating inverter with a specially designed load.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2042461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5491380/05409683.pdf","startPage":"1671","endPage":"1674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2042461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5491380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency-Oriented Design of ZVS Half-Bridge Series Resonant Inverter With Variable Frequency Duty Cycle Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409683/","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency-Oriented Design of ZVS Half-Bridge Series Resonant Inverter With Variable Frequency Duty Cycle Control","volume":"25","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11373783","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409683/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency-Oriented Design of ZVS Half-Bridge Series Resonant Inverter With Variable Frequency Duty Cycle Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-lucia-2042461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069014S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5491380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"5491380","articleId":"5409683","onlineDate":"08 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5409688,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Simulations are run over PLC channels and it is shown that the proposed solutions offer a bit rate gain up to 37% compared to the conventional multicast bit rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2009.5409695","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375737/5409687/05409695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2009.5409695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409687","startPage":"384","endPage":"389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increase in multicast OFDM data rate in PLC network using adaptive LP-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Increase in multicast OFDM data rate in PLC network using adaptive LP-OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409695/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107650","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5409695/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increase in multicast OFDM data rate in PLC network using adaptive LP-OFDM","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"rp061111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045164S","chronDate":"14-16 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375737","isNumber":"5409687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375737","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5409687","articleId":"5409695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5409700,"authors":[{"name":"Bekir Karlik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Hali\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bekir","lastName":"Karlik","id":"37352944000"},{"name":"Mustafa Sari\u00f6z","affiliation":["Computer Technology and Programming, Fatih University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Sari\u00f6z","id":"37871193700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3522-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3523-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-9413"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-9448"}],"articleNumber":"5409700","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409700","abstract":"This paper presents a novel method on coloring the grayscale images.

According to the system performance a proper design for the Power System Stabilizer (PSS) using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is carried out. Then the designed PSS is implemented in the model and the dynamic system response is analyzed. Since the simulation results without the PSS showed unacceptable system response, the system response with the PSS has improved and the PSS succeeded to stabilize an unstable system.","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2009.5409738","startPage":"117","endPage":"119","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375737/5409687/05409738.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2009.5409738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic stability enhancement using Particle Swarm Optimization Power System Stabilizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system dynamics","Power system stability","Particle swarm optimization","Power system modeling","Power system analysis computing","Mathematical model","System performance","Power system simulation","Synchronous machines","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power system dynamic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic stability enhancement","particle swarm optimization","infinite bus power system stabilizer","synchronous machine","Matlab/Simulink","PSS","PSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Stability","Power System Stabilizer","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic stability enhancement using Particle Swarm Optimization Power System Stabilizer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"11137054","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic stability enhancement using Particle Swarm Optimization Power System Stabilizer","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"rp020249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041388S","chronDate":"14-16 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375737","isNumber":"5409687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375737","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5409687","articleId":"5409738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5409743,"authors":[{"name":"A.

huge interest in microwave imaging techniques. Moreover, the recently demonstrated capability of selectively targeting magnetic nanoparticles opens the way for new imaging strategies, that exploit nanoparticles as contrast agent. As a matter of fact, due to the nonmagnetic nature of human tissues, this artificially induced magnetic contrast can be exploited to enhance the response of small and hardly detectable anomalies. In this respect, two microwave imaging strategies, devoted to characterize magnetic targets embedded into an electric scenario, are proposed and a preliminary assessment of their reconstruction capabilities is given.","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2009.5409777","publicationTitle":"2009 Mediterrannean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Mediterrannean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5401173/5409758/05409777.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2009.5409777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409758","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave imaging of artificially induced magnetic anomalies: a feasibility study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microwave imaging of artificially induced magnetic anomalies: a feasibility study","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409777/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107765","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5409777/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave imaging of artificially induced magnetic anomalies: a feasibility study","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"mms20090submission79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059235S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5401173","isNumber":"5409758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5401173","xplore-issue":"5409758","articleId":"5409777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5409794,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A few years ago, a waveguide filled by metamaterials with negative parameters was proposed in order to achieve such perfect tunneling behaviour. The aim of this communication is to both analyze and visualize in the time domain a structure presenting both a plasmonic resonance and perfect tunneling behaviour. This work is carried out by using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) formulation presented in. As shown here, a waveguide filled with a dispersive material is necessary, but it is not mandatory for this material to be DNG. In addition, the main advantage of the FDTD formulation used here is that it is able to directly incorporate any arbitrary high-order frequency dependence of the constitutive parameters, allowing a realistic characterization of high-order dispersive materials.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Mediterrannean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5401173/5409758/05409807.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2009 Mediterrannean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2009.5409807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2009.5409807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD study of surface plasmons and perfect tunneling of power in parallel-plate waveguides","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Surface waves","Plasmons","Tunneling","Dispersion","Metamaterials","Visualization","Resonance","Frequency dependence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersive media","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","metamaterials","plasmonics","surface plasmon resonance","tunnelling","waveguide theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD","surface plasmon","perfect tunneling","parallel plate waveguides","metamaterials","plasmonic resonance","finite difference time domain analysis","high order dispersive materials"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FDTD study of surface plasmons and perfect tunneling of power in parallel-plate waveguides","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107776","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD study of surface plasmons and perfect tunneling of power in parallel-plate waveguides","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"mms20090submission40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079756S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5401173","isNumber":"5409758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5401173","xplore-issue":"5409758","articleId":"5409807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5409813,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-6146-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5409813","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":218,"totalDownloads":6413},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"LAN/MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","Access control","Local area networks","Metropolitan area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["802.1X-2010","access control","authentication","authorization","controlled port","key agreement","LANs","local area networks","MAC security","MAC Service","MANs","metropolitan area networks","port-based network access control","secure association","security","service access point","uncontrolled port"]}],"abstract":"Port-based network access control allows a network administrator to restrict the use of IEEE 802 LAN service access points (ports) to secure communication between authenticated and authorized devices.

Since nuclear reactors are complex and nonlinear systems, it is quite necessary to design a nonlinear state-observer with high-performance for nuclear reactors. A dissipation-based high gain filter (DHGF) is presented for nonlinear systems in this paper, and robustness analysis is also given. The DHGF is then applied to the state-observation for a nuclear heating reactor (NHR), and simulation results show the feasibility of the DHGF.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5409982/","accessionNumber":"11136067","displayDocTitle":"Dissipation-Based High Gain Filter for Monitoring Nuclear Reactors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dissipation-Based High Gain Filter for Monitoring Nuclear Reactors","sourcePdf":"tns-dong-2034743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099671S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5409970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5409970","articleId":"5409982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5409987,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyin Yao","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoyin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37401888300"},{"name":"Lawrence T.

Since foundry SRAM cells can be validated during process development and manufacturing ramp but radiation hardening by design cells cannot, we use a specialized test structure to validate the cell design here. Stability, manufacturability, and hardness are experimentally investigated using a 4 kbit SRAM structure, fabricated on one version of the foundry 90 nm process. The structure, combined with a novel test and simulation based extraction procedure, allows direct measurement of the as-fabricated cell electrical characteristics. Variation of the SRAM switching points due to irradiation as well as the individual transistor threshold voltage variability is measured in the SRAM array test structure. Irradiation tests show negligible impact on switching voltage and increase in the standby current less than 1.5% after 2 Mrad(Si). The effects on the cell margins are also analyzed. The specific SRAM cell layout, which uses a very low aspect ratio, is intended to minimize multibit upset of horizontally adjacent cells. This impact is also discussed with measured heavy ion results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5409970/05409987.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2034661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2034661","startPage":"258","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Experimental Validation of Radiation Hardened by Design SRAM Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409987/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Experimental Validation of Radiation Hardened by Design SRAM Cells","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409987/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11105683","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Experimental Validation of Radiation Hardened by Design SRAM Cells","sourcePdf":"tns-yao-2034661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073082S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5409970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5409970","articleId":"5409987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5409998,"authors":[{"name":"Don DeWitt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"DeWitt","id":"37410336200"},{"name":"Nathan G.

The SBP method allows an intrinsic spatial resolution of ~1.6 mm FWHM to be achieved using our cMiCE design. Previous SBP solutions have required a postprocessing procedure due to the computation and memory intensive nature of SBP. This new implementation takes advantage of a combination of algebraic simplifications, conversion to fixed-point math, and a hierarchal search technique to greatly accelerate the algorithm. For the presented seven stage, 127 \u00d7 127 bin LUT implementation, these algorithm improvements result in a reduction from > 7 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n floating-point operations per event for an exhaustive search to < 5 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n integer operations per event. Simulations show nearly identical FWHM positioning resolution for this accelerated SBP solution, and positioning differences of <0.1 mm from the exhaustive search solution. A pipelined field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of this optimized algorithm is able to process events in excess of 250 K events per second, which is greater than the maximum expected coincidence rate for an individual detector. In contrast with all detectors being processed at a centralized host, as in the current system, a separate FPGA is available at each detector, thus dividing the computational load. These methods allow SBP results to be calculated in real-time and to be presented to the image generation components in real-time. A hardware implementation has been developed using a commercially available prototype board.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2030581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5409972/05409998.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2030581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an FPGA-Based Algorithm for Real-Time Solutions of Statistics-Based Positioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5409998/","displayDocTitle":"Design of an FPGA-Based Algorithm for Real-Time Solutions of Statistics-Based Positioning","volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11136084","pubMedId":"21197135","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5409998/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an FPGA-Based Algorithm for Real-Time Solutions of Statistics-Based Positioning","sourcePdf":"tns-miyaoka-2030581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048604S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5409972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5409972","articleId":"5409998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
