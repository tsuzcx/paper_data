We proposed the anomalous signal detection based on HMM using the amplitude density distribution of an EM wave signal, which does not contain an anomalous signal. The effective ness of HMM approach for detecting an anomalous signal is already reported. However, the relationship between an anomalous signal and an output of HMM is not considered enough.

SoftWare Radio (SWR) is another example of multi-carrier signals and inherits high PAPR. Also, as SWR is an enabling technology for Cognitive Radio (CR) systems, therefore signals also demonstrate high power fluctuations in CR context. Upon opportunistic spectrum access in CR, the situation regarding PAPR becomes even grave as more carriers (secondary carriers) are added in an already large numbered multi-carrier signal (primary signal). This paper explores the PAPR variations on spectrum access in CR context. Also, the reduction of PAPR in CR is performed using a PAPR reduction method called Tone Reservation (TR). In TR, certain carriers of the data signal are reserved to create a peak reducing signal which on addition to the data signal reduces its peak power.

The arrangement between beam-forming and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) can broaden the coverage and capacity of users for wireless communication system.

However, because of the single ended structure, these circuits suffer significant harmonic contents in the output and it is usually inevitable to design load matching networks very carefully to get low harmonic content. In this paper, the design of a balanced Class E power amplifier being symmetrically driven by two Class E circuits is studied. The balanced Class E circuit, under nominal operating conditions, has lower harmonic distortions, and the design of the impedance matching network for harmonic filtering becomes less critical. Practical design equations for Class E operation are given and simulation results graphically presented. It has been found that the proposed balanced GaN HEMT class-E amplifier can deliver the higher power, higher efficiency performances and lower harmonic distortion than single ended topologies for WiMax applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6050570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6050570/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12340056","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and simulation of GaN HEMT balanced Class E power amplifier for WiMax applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and simulation of GaN HEMT balanced Class E power amplifier for WiMax applications","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"CP9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031061S","chronDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036397","isNumber":"6050234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036397","xplore-issue":"6050234","articleId":"6050570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6050576,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Ispas","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Ispas","id":"37868906600"},{"name":"Christian Schneider","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37323248800"},{"name":"Guido Dartmann","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Dartmann","id":"37391629400"},{"name":"Xitao Gong","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Xitao","lastName":"Gong","id":"37407033800"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"},{"name":"Reiner Thom\u00e4","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Reiner","lastName":"Thom\u00e4","id":"37279111800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6051-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5117-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5118-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6050576","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Downlink","Macrocell networks","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","cellular radio","cooperative communication","fading channels","next generation networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatched downlink beamforming technique","nonstationary channel measurement","intercell interference limited network","next generation cellular network","downlink interference","measurement-based performance evaluation","single user detection","fading channel","urban macrocell scenario","cooperative technique","information approximation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of mismatched downlink beamforming over non-stationary channels with interference","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6050234","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036397/6050234/06050576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050576","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6050576","abstract":"Inter-cell interference is the limiting factor in next generation cellular networks with frequency reuse factor 1.

We study the achievable performance of inter-cell interference-limited networks with single-user detection for slow and fast fading channels that are non-stationary but doubly underspread. The evaluation is based on channel measurements at 2.53 GHz in an urban macrocell scenario. Different beamforming techniques, a non-cooperative and two cooperative ones, are used and their robustness to the non-stationarity of the channel is evaluated. The cooperative techniques are found to be much less robust to the non-stationarity of the channel. Furthermore, an approximation of the mutual information is evaluated; it is more accurate for the cooperative techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6050576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12329931","htmlLink":"/document/6050576/","conferenceDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of mismatched downlink beamforming over non-stationary channels with interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of mismatched downlink beamforming over non-stationary channels with interference","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"CA1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075866S","chronDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036397","isNumber":"6050234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036397","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6050234","articleId":"6050576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6050577,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Jacob","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37303837700"},{"name":"Anton de Graauw","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"de Graauw","id":"37298587000"},{"name":"Maristella Spella","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Maristella","lastName":"Spella","id":"37892367500"},{"name":"Pablo Herrero","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Herrero","id":"37544053600"},{"name":"Sebastian Priebe","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Priebe","id":"37391520300"},{"name":"Joerg Schoebel","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Schoebel","id":"37298981900"},{"name":"Thomas K\u00fcrner","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"K\u00fcrner","id":"37299707500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6051-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5117-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5118-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6050577","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Humans","Bit error rate","Lenses","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","millimetre wave antennas","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WLAN antennas","realistic propagation conditions","human shadowing","ray tracing","human blockage","radio propagation","living room scenario","3D antenna patterns","smart antennas","radio channel data","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the evaluation of different 60 GHz WLAN antenna designs is presented.

The performance of the antennas is compared in terms of the coverage probability within the living room.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050577","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036397/6050234/06050577.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6050234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050577","publicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of 60 GHz WLAN antennas under realistic propagation conditions with human shadowing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6050577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of 60 GHz WLAN antennas under realistic propagation conditions with human shadowing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6050577/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6050577/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12329932","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of 60 GHz WLAN antennas under realistic propagation conditions with human shadowing","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"CA10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066095S","chronDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036397","isNumber":"6050234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036397","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6050234","articleId":"6050577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6050578,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Jandura","affiliation":["CA07-Propagation Measurement Based Performance Evaluation of Advanced MIMO Systems, Actix GmbH, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Jandura","id":"37396177500"},{"name":"Jens Voigt","affiliation":["CA07-Propagation Measurement Based Performance Evaluation of Advanced MIMO Systems, Actix GmbH, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Voigt","id":"37357138100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6051-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5117-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5118-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6050578","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"The need of incorporating Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology into radio network planning and optimization rises dramatically for network operators. One main question to answer is how accurate MIMO channel models reflect the real MIMO channel. To answer, we already compared eigenvalue statistics of various single-user (SU) and multi-user (MU) Cooperative Multi-Point (CoMP)-MIMO scenarios [1, 2, 3, 4] to verify a 3D ray tracing channel simulator with channel sounding measurements in the 2.53 GHz range, a major frequency band for LTE transmission in Europe. This contribution adds a comprehensive verification of time- and angular dispersion characteristics by carefully analyzing results of a dedicated high-resolution measurement campaign. These extra measurement data allow for an intermediate step of high-resolution post-processing of the measurement data [5, 6] to estimate radio channel parameters. These estimated parameters are then directly compared with ray tracing channel simulation results, especially in the rarely analyzed angular domain.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036397/6050234/06050578.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6050234","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6050578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of time- and angular dispersion between channel sounding measurements and ray tracing in CoMP-MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Channel estimation","Receivers","Data models","Azimuth","Ray tracing","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio networks","ray tracing","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time dispersion","angular dispersion","channel sounding measurements","ray tracing","CoMP-MIMO channels","multiple-input multiple-output technology","MIMO technology","radio network planning","radio network optimization","eigenvalue statistics","single-user cooperative multi-point-MIMO scenario","multi-user cooperative multi-point-MIMO scenario","LTE transmission","frequency 2.53 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6050578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of time- and angular dispersion between channel sounding measurements and ray tracing in CoMP-MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6050578/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12329933","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of time- and angular dispersion between channel sounding measurements and ray tracing in CoMP-MIMO channels","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"CA2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054529S","chronDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036397","isNumber":"6050234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036397","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6050234","articleId":"6050578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6050579,"authors":[{"name":"Werner L.

The aim of anomaly detection is to detect pixels in the hyperspectral datacube whose spectra differ significantly from the background spectra. In anomaly detection no prior knowledge about the target is assumed. Anomaly detection methods in general estimate the spectra of the background (locally or globally) and then detect anomalies as pixels with a large spectral distance w.r.t. the determined background spectra. Many types of anomaly detectors have been proposed in literature, each depending on several parameters. The aim of this paper is to compare the results of different types of anomaly detection when they are applied to scenes with different complexity: urban scenes with different complexity and rural scenes with sub-pixel anomalies. This paper only considers hyperspectral data in the VNIR and SWIR part of the EM spectrum (\u03bb = 0.4-2.5\u03bcm).","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036397/6050234/06050650.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 XXXth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2011.6050650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6050234","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6050650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral anomaly detection: A comparative evaluation of methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Covariance matrix","Computer aided manufacturing","Image segmentation","Complexity theory","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral anomaly detection","hyperspectral data","urban scenes","rural scenes","VNIR","SWIR","EM spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6050650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral anomaly detection: A comparative evaluation of methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6050650/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12353778","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral anomaly detection: A comparative evaluation of methods","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"DF5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04448S","chronDate":"13-20 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036397","isNumber":"6050234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036397","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6050234","articleId":"6050650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6050688,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Costa","affiliation":["Dipartimento Ingegneria dellInformazione, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Costa","id":"37401434100"},{"name":"Agostino Monorchio","affiliation":["Dipartimento Ingegneria dellInformazione, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Agostino","lastName":"Monorchio","id":"37277494100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6051-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5117-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5118-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6050688","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":764},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Reflection","Wideband","Radar antennas","Transmitting antennas","Insertion loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","frequency selective surfaces","numerical analysis","radomes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absorptive frequency selective radome","pass band filter","reflection band","FSS filter","ground plane","outer wideband absorber","resistive high-impedance surfaces","antenna system","equivalent circuit","full-wave numerical simulations"]}],"abstract":"A frequency selective radome is presented, acting as a pass band filter at a given frequency band, while behaving as an absorber out of the operating band.

The authors have been studying thin coaxial antenna for intracavitary microwave heating aiming at the treatment of bile duct carcinoma. In this treatment, an endoscope is first inserted into the duodenum and a long and flexible coaxial antenna is then inserted into the forceps channel of the endoscope, which is used to insert the tool for surgical treatment. Finally, the antenna is guided to the bile duct through the papilla of Vater, which is located in the duodenum, and is inserted in the bile duct. Up to now, the heating characteristics of the antenna are investigated by numerical simulation, experiment using tissue-equivalent phantom and extracted organs. In this study, the authors have an experience on animal experiment using a swine. In the experiment, temperature rises around the antenna inserted into the bile duct were measured.

Our proposed method generalizes the well-known EKF algorithm by imposing physical constraints on the system states. Note that the state constraints are encountered very often in practice that give rise to considerable difficulties in system analysis and design. The main purpose of this paper is to handle the dynamic modeling problem with state constraints by combining the extended Kalman filtering and constrained optimization algorithms via the maximization probability method. More specifically, a recently developed SPSO algorithm is used to cope with the constrained optimization problem by converting it into an unconstrained optimization one through adding a penalty term to the objective function. The proposed algorithm is then employed to simultaneously identify the parameters and states of a lateral flow immunoassay model. It is shown that the proposed algorithm gives much improved performance over the traditional EKF method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6051426/","accessionNumber":"12489696","pubMedId":"22025755","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid EKF and Switching PSO Algorithm for Joint State and Parameter Estimation of Lateral Flow Immunoassay Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid EKF and Switching PSO Algorithm for Joint State and Parameter Estimation of Lateral Flow Immunoassay Models","sourcePdf":"ttb2012020321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083122S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"6138579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6138579","articleId":"6051426","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6051462,"authors":[{"name":"Milos Nedeljkovic","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Institute, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Nedeljkovic","id":"37586708000"},{"name":"Richard Soref","affiliation":["Physics and Engineering Departments, University of Massachusetts at Boston, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Soref","id":"37285025400"},{"name":"Goran Z.

More recent experimental results for terahertz absorption of silicon are also used to improve the commonly used 1.3- and 1.55-\u03bcm equations.

Given the increase in multielectrode recordings, this is a strong limitation.

Aiming at this problem, we developed a novel approach based on fuzzy genetic algorithm (GA) to boost the computing efficiency of covariance matching. The approach employs GA in searching for optimal solution in a large image region. To avoid premature convergence or local optimum which often occur in traditional GAs, we use a fuzzy inference system to adaptively estimate the crossover and mutation probabilities to gain convergence in a much higher speed than using a conventional GA. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the processing speed of covariance matching, while keeping the matching results almost unchanged. The runtime performance of the proposed approach is faster than its counterparts using exhaustive search with eight times and more.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12486961","htmlLink":"/document/6051484/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Covariance Matching With Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Covariance Matching With Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2172453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143203S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6133473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6133473","articleId":"6051484","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6051485,"authors":[{"name":"Wencong Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6133473/6051485/6051485-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wencong Su (S'06) received the B.S. degree (with distinction) in electrical engineering from Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, in 2009.

The anticipation of a large penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into the market brings up many technical problems that are highly related to industrial information technologies within the next ten years. There is a need for an in-depth understanding of the electrification of transportation in the industrial environment. It is important to consolidate the practical and the conceptual knowledge of industrial informatics in order to support the emerging electric vehicle (EV) technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the electrification of transportation in an industrial environment. In addition, it provides a comprehensive survey of the EVs in the field of industrial informatics systems, namely: 1) charging infrastructure and PHEV/PEV batteries; 2) intelligent energy management; 3) vehicle-to-grid; and 4) communication requirements. Moreover, this paper presents a future perspective of industrial information technologies to accelerate the market introduction and penetration of advanced electric drive vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2172454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6133473/06051485.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2172454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on the Electrification of Transportation in a Smart Grid Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on the Electrification of Transportation in a Smart Grid Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051485/","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6051485/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12479098","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on the Electrification of Transportation in a Smart Grid Environment","sourcePdf":"tii-su-2172454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12339S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6133473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"501","xplore-issue":"6133473","articleId":"6051485","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6051489,"authors":[{"name":"Hin Kwan Wong","affiliation":["Systems, Measurement and Modelling Research Group, School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6145766/6051489/6051489-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hin Kwan (Roland) Wong received the M.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering with communication from the University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K., in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree, working in collaboration with the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium, on the behavior, identification, and measurement of nonlinear systems.","Mr. Wong was the recipient of the IBM Student Recognition Award in 2007, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Prize and the Dean\u2019s Award for Academic Excellence in 2009, and the Best Research Student Poster Prize at the 2010 United Kingdom Automatic Control Council (UKACC) International Conference on Control."]},"firstName":"Hin Kwan","lastName":"Wong","id":"38240255600"},{"name":"Johan Schoukens","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6145766/6051489/6051489-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Johan Schoukens (F\u203297) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium, in 1980 and 1985, respectively, and the Doctor Honoris Causa degree from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary, in 2011.","From 1981 to 2000, he was a Researcher of the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FWO-Vlaanderen) with the Electrical Engineering Department, VUB, where he is currently a full-time Professor in electrical engineering.

However, this is not the case for non-Gaussian input signals, for which the frequency response is biased with respect to the Gaussian BLA. In this paper, theoretical expressions for determining this bias for Wiener-Hammerstein systems are developed both for binary input signals and for white noise inputs with arbitrary probability distribution. Cubic and quintic nonlinearities are considered, but the methods can be extended to other forms of polynomial nonlinearity. Simple measures for quantifying the bias are also developed. It is shown that the bias decays rapidly to zero for a growing length of the impulse response.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6051489/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524360","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Best Linear Approximation of a Wiener\u2013Hammerstein System for Arbitrary Amplitude Distributions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Best Linear Approximation of a Wiener\u2013Hammerstein System for Arbitrary Amplitude Distributions","sourcePdf":"tim-schoukens-2169615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062025S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6145766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6145766","articleId":"6051489","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":6051491,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The channel is modeled by real/complex additive noise of arbitrary distribution. Two problems are addressed. The first problem concerns whether uniquely detectable overloaded matrices exist in the absence of additive noise under these general settings, and if so, whether there are any practical optimum detection algorithms. The second one is about the bounds for the sum channel capacity when user data and signature matrices employ any real or complex alphabets (finite or infinite). In response to the first problem, we have developed practical maximum likelihood detection algorithms for overloaded CDMA systems for a large class of alphabets. In response to the second problem, a general theorem has been developed in which the sum capacity lower bounds with respect to the number of users, spreading gain, and signal-to-noise ratio can be derived. To show the power and utility of the main theorem, a number of sum capacity bounds for special cases are evaluated. An important conclusion of this paper is that the lower and upper bounds of the sum capacity for small/medium-size CDMA systems depend on both the input and the signature symbols; this is contrary to the asymptotic results for large-scale systems reported in the literature (also confirmed in this paper) where the signature symbols and statistics disappear for signature matrices and input vectors with i.i.d. entries. Furthermore, upper and asymptotic bounds are derived and compared to other derivations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Noise measurement","Upper bound","Additive noise","Wireless communication","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","interference suppression","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signature sequences","synchronous CDMA","arbitrary symbol alphabets","code division multiple access","wireless communication","optical communication systems","user symbols","signature matrix","additive noise","overloaded matrices","optimum detection algorithms","sum channel capacity","maximum likelihood detection","signal-to-noise ratio","large-scale systems","optimal signature design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi access channels","optimal signature design","overloaded CDMA","sum capacity","synchronous CDMA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051491","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2172391","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6157047/06051491.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2172391","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Signature Sequences for Overloaded CDMA and Bounds on the Sum Capacity With Arbitrary Symbol Alphabets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Signature Sequences for Overloaded CDMA and Bounds on the Sum Capacity With Arbitrary Symbol Alphabets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051491/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6051491/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12557592","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Signature Sequences for Overloaded CDMA and Bounds on the Sum Capacity With Arbitrary Symbol Alphabets","sourcePdf":"tit-marvasti-2172391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167668S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6157047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6157047","articleId":"6051491","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6051495,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Aidin Bassam","affiliation":["IRadio laboratory, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Seyed Aidin","lastName":"Bassam","id":"37391029800"},{"name":"Wenhua Chen","affiliation":["IRadio laboratory, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279187600"},{"name":"Mohamed Helaoui","affiliation":["IRadio laboratory, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Helaoui","id":"37283434500"},{"name":"Fadhel M.

By taking advantage of harmonic ratio of asymmetric stepped-impedance resonators, 2.4- and 5.2-GHz resonators are designed. The second resonance of 2.4-GHz resonators is designed to be suppressed by a transmission zero created by extended feed lines. To achieve a wide upper stopband, 5.2-GHz resonators are designed with a scheme that the second peak of these resonators would not appear at a frequency lower than a third peak of 2.4-GHz resonators. Several design graphs for deciding both geometric parameters and transmission zeros are plotted by using the information obtained from electromagnetic simulations. While extracting coupling coefficients between resonators, an external quality factor at 50-\u03a9 port is fixed to determine the precise transmission zeros. Two kinds of feed lines, such as a hook type and a spiral type, are developed, and spiral-type feed lines are chosen for realizing switchable filters. By controlling p-i-n diodes, four states of switchable dual bands are clearly presented in simulations and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2168973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6097085/06051501.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2168973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097085","startPage":"3037","endPage":"3047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independently Controllable Dual-Band Bandpass Filters Using Asymmetric Stepped-Impedance Resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Independently Controllable Dual-Band Bandpass Filters Using Asymmetric Stepped-Impedance Resonators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408767","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6051501/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independently Controllable Dual-Band Bandpass Filters Using Asymmetric Stepped-Impedance Resonators","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2168973-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087613S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6097085","articleId":"6051501","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6051506,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Dolara","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6108459/6051506/6051506-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Dolara (S'09) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently a temporary Researcher at the Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, where his areas of research include traction systems, power quality, electromagnetic compatibility, and renewable sources."]},"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Dolara","id":"37590075600"},{"name":"Moris Gualdoni","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6108459/6051506/6051506-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Moris Gualdoni (S'10) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2010 from the Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include electrical machines, renewable sources and traction systems."]},"firstName":"Moris","lastName":"Gualdoni","id":"37585916700"},{"name":"Sonia Leva","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6108459/6051506/6051506-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Sonia Leva (M'01) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","From 1999 to 2010, she was an Assistant Professor.

The uncertainty of wind power generation is considered in this study to compare the two approaches, while other types of uncertainty can be addressed similarly. For the simulation of uncertainty, the scenario-based approach considers the Monte Carlo (MC) method, while lower and upper bounds are adopted in the interval optimization. The Stochastic SCUC problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) problem and solved using the two approaches. The scenario-based solutions are insensitive to the number of scenarios, but present additional computation burdens. The interval optimization solution requires less computation and automatically generates lower and upper bounds for the operation cost and generation dispatch, but its optimal solution is very sensitive to the uncertainty interval. The numerical results on a six-bus system and the modified IEEE 118-bus system show the attributes of the two approaches for solving the Stochastic SCUC problem. Several convergence acceleration options are also discussed for overcoming the computation obstacles in the scenario-based approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2164947","startPage":"913","endPage":"921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2164947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186889","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6186889/06051513.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Scenario-Based and Interval Optimization Approaches to Stochastic SCUC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051513/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Scenario-Based and Interval Optimization Approaches to Stochastic SCUC","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6051513/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12692008","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Scenario-Based and Interval Optimization Approaches to Stochastic SCUC","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wu-2164947-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087947S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6186889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"6186889","articleId":"6051513","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6051514,"authors":[{"name":"Aashish Pant","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6252108/6051514/6051514-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aashish Pant received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2010.","He is currently working as an R&D Engineer in the Design-to-Silicon Division at Mentor Graphics.

We introduce the concept of hardware signatures as the measured post manufacturing hardware characteristics that can be used to drive software adaptation across different die. Using H.264 encoding as an example, we demonstrate significant yield improvements (as much as 30% points at 0% hardware overdesign), a reduction in overdesign (by as much as 8% points at 80% yield) as well as application quality improvements (about 2.0 dB increase in average peak-signal-to-noise ratio at 70% yield). Further, we investigate implications of limited information exchange (i.e., signature quantization) on yield and quality. We conclude that hardware-signature-based application adaptation is an easy and inexpensive (to implement), better informed (by actual application requirements) and effective way to manage yield-cost-quality tradeoffs in application-implementation design flows.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12884082","htmlLink":"/document/6051514/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"AppAdapt: Opportunistic Application Adaptation in Presence of Hardware Variation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AppAdapt: Opportunistic Application Adaptation in Presence of Hardware Variation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pant-2167360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086056S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6252108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6252108","articleId":"6051514","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6051518,"authors":[{"name":"Farzam Nejabatkhah","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6051518/6051518-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farzam Nejabatkhah (S\u201909\u2013M\u201910) was born in Tabriz, Iran, in 1987.

The proposed converter interfaces two unidirectional input power ports and a bidirectional port for a storage element in a unified structure. This converter is interesting for hybridizing alternative energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) source, fuel cell (FC) source, and battery. Supplying the output load, charging or discharging the battery can be made by the PV and the FC power sources individually or simultaneously. The proposed structure utilizes only four power switches that are independently controlled with four different duty ratios. Utilizing these duty ratios, tracking the maximum power of the PV source, setting the FC power, controlling the battery power, and regulating the output voltage are provided. Depending on utilization state of the battery, three different power operation modes are defined for the converter. In order to design the converter control system, small-signal model is obtained in each operation mode. Due to interactions of converter control loops, decoupling network is used to design separate closed-loop controllers. The validity of the proposed converter and its control performance are verified by simulation and experimental results for different operation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159241","startPage":"2309","endPage":"2324","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6159241/06051518.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051518","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Hybrid power systems","Control systems","Microwave integrated circuits","Topology","Reliability","Bridge circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery storage plants","closed loop systems","DC-DC power convertors","fuel cell power plants","hybrid power systems","maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems","power control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-input DC-DC boost converter","hybrid PV-FC-battery power system","unidirectional input power ports","bidirectional port","storage element","energy sources","photovoltaic source","fuel cell source","battery power control","power switches","duty ratios","maximum power point tracking","output voltage regulation","converter control system","small-signal model","converter control loops","decoupling network","closed-loop controller design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoupling method","photovoltaic/fuel cell (PV/FC)/battery hybrid power system","small-signal modeling","state-space averaging","three-input dc\u2013dc boost converter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Control of a New Three-Input DC\u2013DC Boost Converter for Hybrid PV/FC/Battery Power System","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12571265","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6051518/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051518/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Control of a New Three-Input DC\u2013DC Boost Converter for Hybrid PV/FC/Battery Power System","sourcePdf":"tpel-hosseini-2172465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098214S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6159241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"6159241","articleId":"6051518","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6051519,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Sik Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6051519/6051519-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Sik Park (S\u201908) was born in Korea in 1981.

UKF propagates the so called sigma points by function evaluations using the unscented transformation (UT), and this is at first glance very different from the standard EKF algorithm which is based on a linearized model. The claimed advantages with UKF are that it propagates the first two moments of the posterior distribution and that it does not require gradients of the system model. We point out several less known links between EKF and UKF in terms of two conceptually different implementations of the Kalman filter: the standard one based on the discrete Riccati equation, and one based on a formula on conditional expectations that does not involve an explicit Riccati equation. First, it is shown that the sigma point function evaluations can be used in the classical EKF rather than an explicitly linearized model. Second, a less cited version of the EKF based on a second-order Taylor expansion is shown to be quite closely related to UKF. The different algorithms and results are illustrated with examples inspired by core observation models in target tracking and sensor network applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2172431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","startPage":"545","endPage":"555","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06051522.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Relations Between Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6051522/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Some Relations Between Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12461103","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Relations Between Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters","sourcePdf":"tsp-gustafsson-2172431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067249S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"6126210","articleId":"6051522","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6051523,"authors":[{"name":"Cheol Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6104236/6051523/6051523-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheol Jeong (M'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, in 2010.","In August 2010, he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, where he is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow.

The relay is a user who is willing to help the communication from the source to the destination. In our paper, however, the relay is untrusted in the sense that it may make a passive security attack; that is, it may decode messages of the source. We consider two ways to transmit confidential information of the source to the destination: noncooperative secure beamforming and cooperative secure beamforming. In the noncooperative scheme, the relay is simply treated as an eavesdropper, and does not participate in communication. In the cooperative scheme, the relay is asked to relay signals from the source to the destination. In this paper, the source and relay beamforming is jointly designed to maximize the secrecy rate in the cooperative scheme. The conditions under which the cooperative scheme achieves a higher secrecy rate than the noncooperative scheme are derived in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes of the source-relay and relay-destination links. The performance of the secure beamforming schemes is compared through extensive numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","volume":"60","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12425259","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6051523/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Secure Beamforming Design at the Source and the Relay for an Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Untrusted Relay System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Secure Beamforming Design at the Source and the Relay for an Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Untrusted Relay System","sourcePdf":"tsp-kim-2172433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170857S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6051523","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6051525,"authors":[{"name":"Ami Wiesel","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6104236/6051525/6051525-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ami Wiesel (M'07) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2007.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, during 2007\u20132009.

These models factorize the multivariate distribution and allow for efficient distributed signal processing methods such as belief propagation (BP). The classical maximum likelihood approach to this covariance estimation problem, or potential function estimation in BP terminology, requires centralized computing and is computationally intensive. This motivates suboptimal distributed alternatives that tradeoff accuracy for communication cost. A natural solution is for each node to perform estimation of its local covariance with respect to its neighbors. The local maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically consistent but suboptimal, i.e., it does not minimize mean squared estimation (MSE) error. We propose to improve the MSE performance by introducing additional symmetry constraints using averaging and pseudolikelihood estimation approaches. We compute the proposed estimates using message passing protocols, which can be efficiently implemented in large scale graphical models with many nodes.

Cognitive users should particularly consider the problem of interference with licensed users and satisfy the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement at the same time. We propose a new iterative algorithm using the game theory in this paper. We consider not only the SINR requirement as other game algorithms but also the influence of power threshold. The variable power limit is the characteristic of CR. We prove the convergence of the algorithm and the existence of Nash equilibrium. According to different power thresholds, we give an approach for solving the problem of coexistence between licensed user and cognitive user in a cognitive system. The algorithm has the advantage that it can be distributively implemented, and the method converges relatively fast. Numerical results are presented to show that the proposed approach has better antinoise effect and capacity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2172474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06051527.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2172474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"4384","endPage":"4391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Game Algorithm for Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A New Game Algorithm for Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051527/","volume":"60","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6051527/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408176","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Game Algorithm for Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2172474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085221S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6051527","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6051528,"authors":[{"name":"Minming Ni","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6051528/6051528-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minming Ni received the B.Eng. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2006.","He started his successive postgraduate and doctoral programs of study in September 2007.

This is particularly important for networks with mobile nodes, where the mobility can cause randomly and dynamically changed network topology. In this paper, we propose a mobility prediction-based clustering (MPBC) scheme for ad hoc networks with high mobility nodes, where a node may change the associated cluster head (CH) several times during the lifetime of its connection. The proposed clustering scheme includes an initial clustering stage and a cluster maintaining stage. The Doppler shifts associated with periodically exchanged Hello packets between neighboring nodes are used to estimate their relative speeds, and the estimation results are utilized as the basic information in MPBC. In the initial clustering stage, the nodes having the smallest relative mobility in their neighborhoods are selected as the CHs. In the cluster maintaining stage, mobility prediction strategies are introduced to handle the various problems caused by node movements, such as possible association losses to current CHs and CH role changes, for extending the connection lifetime and providing more stable clusters. An analytical model is developed to find the upper and lower bounds of the average connection lifetime and to find the average association change rate of MPBC. Numerical results verify the analysis and further show that the proposed clustering scheme outperforms the existing clustering schemes in ad hoc networks with high mobility nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2172473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2172473","startPage":"4549","endPage":"4559","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06051528.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPBC: A Mobility Prediction-Based Clustering Scheme for Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"MPBC: A Mobility Prediction-Based Clustering Scheme for Ad Hoc Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","volume":"60","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6051528/","accessionNumber":"12408177","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051528/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPBC: A Mobility Prediction-Based Clustering Scheme for Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-ni-2172473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094677S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6051528","onlineDate":"18 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":6051530,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183925300"},{"name":"Seung Joon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Joon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37367720800"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6051530","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"We propose to optimize a decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative relaying scheme with Hybrid Automatic-Repeat-reQuest (HARQ) protocol for maximizing long-term average transmission rate (LATR) while satisfying the required maximum number of HARQ rounds and the required outage probability in Rayleigh block-fading channels.

A complete mathematical model is developed in the case of IPM machine, by taking also into account the dependence of the rotor position estimation error on the mutual inductance, which is neglected in the past literature adopting the same sensorless approach. Estimation is performed within a single PWM period, differently from previous approaches. Measurement of current derivatives is obtained from dedicated Rogowski coils, oversampling and real-time processing of the measured values. Acquisition issues due to short application times of voltage vector (e.g. during zero and low speed operations) have been overcome by means of a proper edge-shifting technique on the PWM signals.

Speed estimation performance of the new MRAS scheme is studied and compared with the classical rotor flux MRAS when applied to an indirect vector control induction motor drive. Experimental results are shown for the two schemes in the low speed region of operation including tests for the regenerating mode.

Furthermore, the marketing literature has placed increasing emphasis on the importance of understanding customers' processes and customer value. This paper presents an action research study on the roadmapping problems of two software product companies. The key findings were that customer knowledge was fragmented across different functions of the companies and that roadmapping neglected service development. To solve these problems, analysis of customer value and customers' processes was integrated into roadmapping. Facilitated workshops with cross-functional teams were used to analyze the customers' processes in their entirety and to create a holistic view to roadmapping. The lessons learned offer practical means with which software companies can shift their focus from the prioritization of software features to the analysis of customers' processes and the prioritization of customers' activities. The shift promotes value creation from the customers' perspective and the discovery of new service business opportunities.","doi":"10.1109/RE.2011.6051662","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th International Requirements Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th International Requirements Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036256/6051621/06051662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2011.6051662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6051621","startPage":"57","endPage":"66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating analysis of customers' processes into roadmapping: The value-creation perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrating analysis of customers' processes into roadmapping: The value-creation perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051662/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316131","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6051662/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating analysis of customers' processes into roadmapping: The value-creation perspective","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"2180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069481S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036256","isNumber":"6051621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036256","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6051621","articleId":"6051662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":6051689,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It can be used in load balancing, traffic detecting and so on. Since traffic should be considered temporally and spatially, prediction is complicated. Tracking dynamic changes of traffic, reducing estimation errors and increasing robustness to noise are factors which should be considered in estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate traffic matrix. This approach combines artificial neural network and evolutionary algorithms. It uses autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) joined with genetic algorithm (GA) which we call it ARXGEN. GA is used in gaining optimized weights and biases. To evaluate our method, we did our simulations on Abilene data. Results prove that it can well track dynamic nature of traffic and has lower estimation errors.

No Voice Activity Detection (VAD) or any other means is used to estimate the input Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The mean vectors of the mixture models of spectral magnitudes derived from models of speech and different noise sources power spectra are used to form sets of over-determined system of equations, as many as noise source candidates, whose solutions lead to the MMSE estimations of speech and additive noise spectral magnitudes. The corresponding power spectra are then used for noise suppression by applying Wiener filtering carried out on overlapping frames. The input SNR is estimated and the nature of the noise involved is determined as by-products of the method used. Results are compared with codebook constrained methods that have shown very good results but suffer from long processing times. It is shown that, at the cost of a slight lower improvement in SNR and PESQ score, the new algorithm reduces the computation time to one fifth which makes it suitable for practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2011.6051692","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2011.6051692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6051687","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045290/6051687/06051692.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech enhancement","Mathematical model","Wiener filter","Signal to noise ratio","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","mean square error methods","speech enhancement","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE speech enhancement","GMM","minimum mean square error","Gaussian mixture modelling","voice activity detection","MMSE estimations","noise suppression","Wiener filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MMSE speech enhancement based on GMM and solving an over-determined system of equations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051692/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6051692/","accessionNumber":"12316619","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE speech enhancement based on GMM and solving an over-determined system of equations","confLoc":"Floriana, Malta","sourcePdf":"1569465871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096478S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045290","isNumber":"6051687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045290","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6051687","articleId":"6051692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6051710,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Although, a disadvantageous aspect of their usage is that they need (usually a significant amount of) time to be trained, which scales with the structural parameters of the networks and with the quantity of the input data. However, the training can be done offline; it has a non-negligible cost and further, can cause a delay in the operation. Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNNs) are the combinations of ANNs and fuzzy logic in order to incorporate the advantages of both methods (the learning ability of ANNs and the thinking ability of fuzzy logic). FNNs have fuzzy values in their weight parameters and in the output of each neuron. Circular Fuzzy Neural Networks (CFNNs) are FNNs with their topology realigned to a circular topology and the connections between the input layer and hidden layer trimmed. This may result in a dramatic reduction in the training time, while the precision and accuracy of the network are not affected. To further increase the speed of the training of the ANNs, FNNs, or CFNNs used for classification, a new training procedure is introduced in this paper: instead of directly using the training data in the training phase, the data is first clustered and the neural networks are trained by using only the centers of the obtained clusters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051720/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12316641","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6051720/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved back-propagation algorithm for neural network training","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved back-propagation algorithm for neural network training","confLoc":"Floriana, Malta","sourcePdf":"1569483957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069378S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045290","isNumber":"6051687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045290","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6051687","articleId":"6051720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6051732,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Ou","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Ou","id":"37076204400"},{"name":"Nong Xiao","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Nong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37410882700"},{"name":"Mingche Lai","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Mingche","lastName":"Lai","id":"37286953900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0885-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-131X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-1328"}],"articleNumber":"6051732","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":753},"abstract":"With more data-intensive applications appearing in the present social life, the NAND flash memory acting as a replacement candidate of hard disk drives is popularly used in some data centers due to its lower power consumption, faster random access, and higher shock resistance.

To this end, we deliver the scalable multi-channel flash memory controller architecture in this paper to exploit the parallelism of multiple chips. It supports all the flash operations, and boosts the performance by evenly distributing multiple accesses among different chips when using the error correction code to improve its reliability. The functions of the multi-channel parallel controller are validated according to a wide spread of workloads. And the evaluation results show that our proposed eight-channel controller outperforms the traditional controller by more than three times and can be well scaled to be 128 channels without extra critical timing path.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Switches","Bandwidth","Fabrics","Computer architecture","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-intensive applications","scalable multichannel parallel NAND flash memory controller architecture","hard disk drives","data centers","shock resistance","random access","traditional solid state disk","multiple chips","flash operations","multiple accesses","error correction code","eight-channel controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data-intensive computing","flash memory","multi-channel parallelism"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051732","doi":"10.1109/ChinaGrid.2011.29","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Sixth Annual Chinagrid Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6048605/6051731/06051732.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaGrid.2011.29","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6051731","publicationTitle":"2011 Sixth Annual Chinagrid Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Multi-channel Parallel NAND Flash Memory Controller Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Multi-channel Parallel NAND Flash Memory Controller Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051732/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"22-23 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6051732/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316648","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Multi-channel Parallel NAND Flash Memory Controller Architecture","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4472a048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125336S","chronDate":"22-23 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6048605","isNumber":"6051731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6048605","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6051731","articleId":"6051732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6051750,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, ChangChun, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Li","id":"37069925500"},{"name":"Gaochao Xu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, ChangChun, China"],"firstName":"Gaochao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37397240400"},{"name":"Guangyu Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, ChangChun, China"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38023058300"},{"name":"Yushuang Dong","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, ChangChun, China"],"firstName":"Yushuang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37897542900"},{"name":"Dan Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, ChangChun, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wang","id":"38025066200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0885-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-131X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-1328"}],"articleNumber":"6051750","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":176,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4509},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Computational modeling","Heuristic algorithms","Load management","Job shop scheduling","Ant colony optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","optimisation","resource allocation","scheduling","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud task scheduling","load balancing ant colony optimization","cloud computing","NP-hard optimization problem","meta-heuristic algorithms","LBACO","CloudSim toolkit package","distributed computing","parallel computing","grid computing","FCFS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["task scheduling","cloud computing","Load Balancing","Ant Colony Optimization","CloudSim"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051750","abstract":"The cloud computing is the development of distributed computing, parallel computing and grid computing, or defined as the commercial implementation of these computer science concepts.

The relays are all equipped with one antenna and with individual power constraint while helping source nodes transmitting their data. A scaled-and-forward (SF) beamforming strategy is first introduced, and it follows an optimal distributed beamforming design based on minimizing the sum of mean square errors (MSMSE) of both source nodes. This system model is then extended to a MIMO scenario, where source nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. Transmit beamforming and receive beamforming of two communication nodes are jointly designed with the relay beamforming in this scheme. A generative iterative algorithm is proposed for the MSMSE-based schemes. Simulation results show that, system performance is greatly enhanced by the optimal beamforming, and with multiple antennas at two source nodes, the system performance is further improved due to the increased space diversity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6051946/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12316833","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6051946/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming Design on Amplify and Forward Two-Way Relaying Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Beamforming Design on Amplify and Forward Two-Way Relaying Channels","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"4455a433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066515S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6050153","isNumber":"6051823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6050153","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6051823","articleId":"6051946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6051951,"authors":[{"name":"Yingjun Sang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of technology, Huaian, Jiangsu, China","Electrical Engineering School, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yingjun","lastName":"Sang","id":"37838744100"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Fan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of technology, Huaian, Jiangsu, China","Changchun Institute of optics, fine mechanics and physics, Chinese academy of sciences, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37836497100"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of technology, Huaian, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"38024797700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0755-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4455-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6051951","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":654},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6051951","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Control systems","Educational institutions","Software algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","learning systems","multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","pendulums","robust control","three-term control","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double inverted pendulum control","BP neural network","balance control","BP algorithm","artificial neural network","training model","test simulation","Tansig function","Purelin function","training algorithm","three-loop PID algorithm","model learning","Matlab calculating software","Simulink simulation experiment","nonlinear control","robust control","time-varying system","strongly coupled system","multivariable system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural networks","improved back propagation algorithm","double inverted pendulum","three-loop pid"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDMA.2011.118","pdfPath":"/iel5/6050153/6051823/06051951.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation","startPage":"456","endPage":"459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6051823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMA.2011.118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double Inverted Pendulum Control Based on Three-loop PID and Improved BP Neural Network","abstract":"To deal with the defects of BP neural networks used in balance control of inverted pendulum, such as longer train time and converging in partial minimum, this article realizes the control of double inverted pendulum with improved BP algorithm of artificial neural networks (ANN), builds up a training model of test simulation and the BP network is 6-10-1 structure.

The experiment results have showed that it will be obtained the information of fault degree and location to the checked cable by the new approach, so that the credible proof will be given about detection and analysis to the broken wires for the cable stayed bridge.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6050153/6051823/06052119.pdf","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1323","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICDMA.2011.324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMA.2011.324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6051823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6052119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Research on Cable Broken Wires Inspection for a Cable Stayed Bridge by Discrete Wavelet Transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic separation","Wavelet transforms","Magnetic flux","Saturation magnetization","Power cables","Noise","Bridge circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridges (structures)","cables (mechanical)","discrete wavelet transforms","Gaussian noise","inspection","magnetic leakage","wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cable broken wires inspection","cable stayed bridge","discrete wavelet transformation","magnetic leakage field","space magnetic field","discrete soft threshold algorithm","Gaussian white noise","circumference magnetic field","fault location","singularity analysis","signal waveform","Lipschitz exponent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["magnetic leakage field inspection","discrete wavelet transformation","cable stayed bridge","separation from signal","noise","singular point"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6052119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Research on Cable Broken Wires Inspection for a Cable Stayed Bridge by Discrete Wavelet Transformation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6052119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316995","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Research on Cable Broken Wires Inspection for a Cable Stayed Bridge by Discrete Wavelet Transformation","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"4455b317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04432S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6050153","isNumber":"6051823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6050153","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6051823","articleId":"6052119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6052135,"authors":[{"name":"Zibin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Wang","id":"38024807300"},{"name":"Liangjun Xiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Liangjun","lastName":"Xiang","id":"38028868900"},{"name":"Linhua Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Linhua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37877354000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0755-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4455-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6052135","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"A sub-optimal cooperative beam forming design method of the amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO two-way relay channels is proposed in this work based on the optimal beam forming design which minimize the sum mean square errors (MSMSE). Suppose the channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known by the receiver and transmitter as well as the relay, global optimal beam forming can be achieved. By analyzing the MSMSE-based optimal method, the results show that effect of the transmit and receive beam forming pairs is to maximize the receive SNR at two communication nodes, and rank of the optimal relay beam forming matrix is no larger than 2 when there is only one data stream at both communication nodes. Based on the analysis, a simplified algorithm is proposed to design the beam forming vectors (matrices). Simulation results show that the system performance of bit error rates (BER) of the simplified method is very close to the optimal one with fast iteration speed and much lower computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6050153/6051823/06052135.pdf","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1190","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICDMA.2011.292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMA.2011.292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6051823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6052135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-optimal Linear Beamforming Design on MIMO Two-Way Relay Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","MIMO","Antennas","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","computational complexity","cooperative communication","error statistics","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO two-way relay channels","suboptimal cooperative beam forming design method","amplify-and-forward relay channels","sum mean square errors","channel state information","receiver","transmitter","MSMSE-based optimal method","optimal relay beamforming matrix","beamforming vectors","bit error rates","BER system performance","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Two-Way Relay","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6052135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sub-optimal Linear Beamforming Design on MIMO Two-Way Relay Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6052135/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-optimal Linear Beamforming Design on MIMO Two-Way Relay Channels","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"4455b187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064355S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6050153","isNumber":"6051823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6050153","xplore-issue":"6051823","articleId":"6052135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6052139,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojuan Sheng","firstName":"Xiaojuan","lastName":"Sheng"},{"name":"Guang-wen Ren","firstName":"Guang-wen","lastName":"Ren"},{"name":"Zhe Wang","firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0755-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4455-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6052139","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Educational institutions","Computer architecture","Hardware","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","educational administrative data processing","training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing SaaS delivery model","university talents training","software as a service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SaaS","cloud computing","university","talents training"]}],"abstract":"SaaS (Software as a Service) and cloud computing are two emerging concepts.

The paper presents a survey of five categories: ML for population initialization, ML for fitness evaluation and selection, ML for population reproduction and variation, ML for algorithm adaptation, and ML for local search.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary Computation Meets Machine Learning: A Survey","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2011.942584","endPage":"75","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/6052357/06052374.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","startPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2011.942584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6052357","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6052374","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","evolutionary computation","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local search","algorithm adaptation","population variation","population reproduction","fitness selection","fitness evaluation","population initialization","data analysis","iterative search process","population information","ML technique enhanced EC algorithm","evolutionary algorithm","machine learning","evolutionary computation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Computation Meets Machine Learning: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6052374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6052374/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12301462","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Computation Meets Machine Learning: A Survey","sourcePdf":"06mci04-review.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121841S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"6052357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"6052357","articleId":"6052374","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6052382,"authors":[{"name":"Sairul I Safie","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal and Image Processing (CeSIP), University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Sairul I","lastName":"Safie","id":"37947394300"},{"name":"John J Soraghan","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal and Image Processing (CeSIP), University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"John J","lastName":"Soraghan","id":"37281998700"},{"name":"Lykourgos Petropoulakis","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal and Image Processing (CeSIP), University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Lykourgos","lastName":"Petropoulakis","id":"37968689800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0766-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0764-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6052382","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6052382","abstract":"This paper presents a new feature extraction method known as Pulse Active Width (PAW) implemented on electrocardiogram (ECG) for biometric authentication.

In such schemes, using multiple antennas at transmitter and receiver sides provides spatial diversity without need for identifiable transmitters. On the other hand, one of the problems facing such approach arises when transmitters of a single frequency network (SFN) are used as non-cooperative transmitters and resolving the signals of multiple transmitters reflected from multiple targets is not trivial at receiver side. Therefore, in order to obtain the diversity gain of MIMO localization schemes, it is necessary to develop a technique to assign each echo arriving at the receiver to a given transmitter. In this paper, we propose such technique, that addresses such association problem in an efficient manner.","doi":"10.1109/MRRS.2011.6053654","publicationTitle":"2011 MICROWAVES, RADAR AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 MICROWAVES, RADAR AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM","pdfPath":"/iel5/6041432/6053583/06053654.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRRS.2011.6053654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6053583","startPage":"280","endPage":"283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO PCL in a single frequency network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6053654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO PCL in a single frequency network","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6053654/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317404","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6053654/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO PCL in a single frequency network","confLoc":"Kiev, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"MRRS2011pp280283Radmard.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055138S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041432","isNumber":"6053583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041432","xplore-issue":"6053583","articleId":"6053654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6053662,"authors":[{"name":"Volodymyr Vasylyshyn","affiliation":["Kharkov Air Force University, Kharkov, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Vasylyshyn","id":"37660160000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9644-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9641-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9643-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6053662","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Estimation","Covariance matrix","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing algorithms","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudo-noise resampling","conventional beamformer","Root-MUSIC resampling","pseudo-randomly generated noise","censored selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction finding","pseudo-noise resampling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the performance of Root-MUSIC via pseudo-noise resampling and conventional beamformer","doi":"10.1109/MRRS.2011.6053662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6053583","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"2011 MICROWAVES, RADAR AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 MICROWAVES, RADAR AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM","pdfPath":"/iel5/6041432/6053583/06053662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRRS.2011.6053662","startPage":"309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6053662","abstract":"A new pseudo-noise resampling technique is proposed to mitigate the effect of outliers in Root-MUSIC.

The microwave beamforming networks are intended for automotive communications beam scanning electronically steered arrays. Although the frequency range likely to be allocated to such systems is 63 GHz, where the short transmission range allows multiple frequency re-use, the planar beamforming networks are frequency scaled models to verify the concept. The objective of this investigation is to develop microwave beamforming networks suitable for a use in inter-vehicle (IVC) and roadside-to-vehicle (RVC) automotive communications electronically steered arrays. The steerable microwave beamforming networks demonstrate appropriateness to develop well-established designs for systems that can be used in automotive communications beam scanning electronically steered array and vehicular telematics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6053671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317421","htmlLink":"/document/6053671/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Microwave beamforming networks employing Rotman lenses and cascaded Butler matrices for automotive communications beam scanning electronically steered arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave beamforming networks employing Rotman lenses and cascaded Butler matrices for automotive communications beam scanning electronically steered arrays","confLoc":"Kiev, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"MRRS2011pp351354Rahimian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094808S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041432","isNumber":"6053583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041432","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6053583","articleId":"6053671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6053805,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Faralli","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Scuola Superiore SantAnna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Faralli","id":"37409208700"},{"name":"Kimchau N.

In order to provide sufficient RF dynamic range to support radio services in links with high optical transmission loss, for example in radio over free-space optics (RoFSO), while keeping costs low, it is necessary to use directly modulated lasers. However, in these applications the lasers must be driven to high modulation depths to maximize dynamic range. Simulations show that under these unique conditions the first detectable nonlinear distortion is often the result of dynamic distortion due to the laser being driven near threshold. It is shown that this type of distortion is characterized by a sharp increase in the contribution of high-order (fourth order or greater) nonlinear terms resulting from the influence of laser relaxation oscillations. As a consequence, the third-order spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) metric no longer accurately reflects the performance of such links as it assumes that third order effects are dominant. An alternative measure of dynamic range called dynamic-distortion-free dynamic range (DDFDR) is proposed. This differs in that the upper limit is defined as the modulating power at which the peak optical modulation index (OMI) reaches unity. At this point the error vector magnitude (EVM) measured for a range of different wireless services starts to increase rapidly due to high order distortion. This makes DDFDR a practical, service-independent metric of dynamic range. For two different wireless services it is observed experimentally that on average the DDFDR upper limit predicts the EVM knee point to within 1.1 dB, while the third-order SFDR predicts it to within 6.2 dB. The DDFDR is thus shown to be a more accurate indicator of real link performance when high-order distortion is dominant.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2172773","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6083491/06053981.pdf","startPage":"3577","endPage":"3586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2172773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Order Distortion in Directly Modulated Semiconductor Lasers in High-Loss Analog Optical Links With Large RF Dynamic Range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6053981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2011","displayDocTitle":"High-Order Distortion in Directly Modulated Semiconductor Lasers in High-Loss Analog Optical Links With Large RF Dynamic Range","volume":"29","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"12384916","htmlLink":"/document/6053981/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Order Distortion in Directly Modulated Semiconductor Lasers in High-Loss Analog Optical Links With Large RF Dynamic Range","sourcePdf":"jlt-gordon-2172773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066912S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6083491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6083491","articleId":"6053981","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6053984,"authors":[{"name":"Shinji Yamashita","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Shinji Yamashita (M'90) was born in Osaka, Japan, on August 14, 1965.

It is among the most important parameters describing the usability range of an SOA in an access network. In this paper, we give design guidelines to maximize the IPDR at a given gain. Our IPDR description indicates that a large IPDR can be obtained if SOAs are designed properly. A particular large IPDR is predicted to be found for well-designed quantum-dot (QD)-SOAs. We apply both theory and experiment to a 1.3- \u03bcm QD-SOA and investigate the IPDR as a function of bitrate, wavelength, and bias current.

The proposed detector, that we call MCMC with list channel estimates (MCMC-LCE), adopts the Gibbs sampler to find a list of mostly likely transmitted sequences and matching channel estimates/impulse responses (CIR), to compute the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of transmitted bits. The MCMC-LCE provides a low-complexity means to approximate the optimal maximum a posterior (MAP) detection in a statistical fashion and is applicable to channels with long memory. Promising behavior of the MCMC-LCE is presented using both synthetic channels and real data collected from underwater acoustic (UWA) channels whose large delay spread and time variation have been the main motivation for the developed system. We also adopt an adaptive variable step-size least mean-square (VSLMS) algorithm for channel tracking. We find that this choice, which does not require prior knowledge on the CIR statistics, is a good fit for UWA channels. Superior performance of the MCMC-LCE over turbo minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) equalizers is demonstrated for a variety of channels examined in this work.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Detectors","Equalizers","Decoding","Markov processes","Underwater acoustics","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov Chain Monte Carlo detection","list channel estimates","data detection","channel estimation","time-varying frequency-selective channel","Gibbs sampler","impulse response","log-likelihood ratio","synthetic channel","underwater acoustic channel","adaptive variable step-size least mean-square algorithm","channel tracking","turbo minimum mean-square-error equalizers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","frequency-selective channels","intersymbol interference","Markov chain Monte Carlo","turbo equalization","underwater acoustic channels"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2172913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6069495/06053992.pdf","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2172913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo Detection for Frequency-Selective Channels Using List Channel Estimates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6053992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo Detection for Frequency-Selective Channels Using List Channel Estimates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6053992/","volume":"5","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6053992/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12360026","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo Detection for Frequency-Selective Channels Using List Channel Estimates","sourcePdf":"jstsp-chen-2172913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100592S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"6053992","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6053993,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Nekuii","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada","Cavium, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6069495/6053993/6053993-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehran Nekuii (S'04\u2013M'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2008.","He is now working as a Scientist in the Wireless Broadband Group, Cavium, Inc., Montreal.

The proposed demodulators are based on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, and hence their computational costs are bounded by a low-order polynomial of the number of bits transmitted per channel use. The first demodulator applies the SDR technique once per demodulation-decoding iteration, and generates list members via the randomization procedure that is inherent in the SDR technique. The second demodulator is based on an approximation of that randomization procedure by a set of independent Bernoulli trials, and this approximation reduces the number of semidefinite programs that need to be solved to just one per channel use. List-free implementations that reduce the memory requirements of list demodulators with moderate to long lists are also developed. Analysis suggests that the proposed \u201cSingle-SDR\u201d demodulator should offer good performance at moderate computational cost, especially for larger systems. This is quantified using simulations of a richly scattered environment, in which the performance of the Single-SDR demodulator is similar to that of the list sphere decoder with moderate sized lists and better than that of the minimum mean square error soft interference canceler. The average computational cost of a straightforward implementation of the Single-SDR demodulator is competitive with that of the list sphere decoder with moderate sized lists, and the distribution of its computational cost is quite concentrated around the average.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal

For high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), deconvolution-based approaches can reconstruct the complex fODF and have advantages in terms of computational efficiency and no need to estimate the number of distinct fiber populations. However, HARDI-based methods usually require relatively high b-values and a large number of gradient directions to produce good results. Such requirements are not always easy to meet in common clinical studies due to limitations in MRI facilities. Moreover, most of these approaches are sensitive to noise. In this study, we propose a new framework to enhance the performance of the spherical deconvolution (SD) approach in low angular resolution DWI by employing a single channel blind source separation (BSS) technique to decompose the fODF initially estimated by SD such that the desired fODF can be extracted from the noisy background. The results based on numerical simulations and two phantom datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than SD in terms of robustness to noise and variation in b-values. In addition, the results show that the proposed method has the potential to be applied to low angular resolution DWI which is commonly used in clinical studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12477336","htmlLink":"/document/6054017/","pubMedId":"22020665","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of Fiber Orientation Distribution Reconstruction in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging by Single Channel Blind Source Separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of Fiber Orientation Distribution Reconstruction in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging by Single Channel Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"tbme-jing-2172793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11153S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6132598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6132598","articleId":"6054017","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6054023,"authors":[{"name":"Farshad Moradi","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Electronics Laboratory, Aarhus School of Engineering, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6074986/6054023/6054023-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farshad Moradi (S'09\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2001, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashahd, Iran, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, in 2011.","From 2005 to 2008, he was a Senior Lecturer with Ilam University, Ilam, Iran.

We show that asymmetry in the device structure leads to unequal currents for positive and negative drain biases, which is exploited to achieve mitigation of read-write conflict in 6T SRAMs. The proposed device exhibits superior short-channel characteristics compared to a conventional FinFET due to reduced electric fields from the terminal that has a lower doping. This results in significantly lower cell leakage in AD-FinFET-based 6T SRAM. Compared to the conventional FinFET-based 6T SRAM, AD-FinFET SRAM shows 5.2%-8.3% improvement in read static noise margin (SNM), 4.1%-10.2% higher write margin, 4.1%-8.8% lower write time, 1.3%-3.5% higher hold SNM, and 2.1-2.5 lower cell leakage at the cost of 20%-23% higher access time.

One of the main challenges in designing a type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) is how to estimate the parameters of the type-2 fuzzy membership function (T2MF) and the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) from imperfect and noisy datasets. This paper presents an automatic approach to learn and tune Gaussian interval type-2 membership functions (IT2MFs) with application to multidimensional pattern classification problems. T2MFs and their FOUs are tuned according to the uncertainties in the training dataset by a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and cross-validation techniques. In our GA-based approach, the structure of the chromosome has fewer genes than other GA methods, and chromosome initialization is more precise. The proposed approach addresses the application of the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) for the problem of nodule classification in a lung computer-aided detection system. The designed IT2FLS is compared with its type-1 fuzzy logic system (T1FLS) counterpart. The results demonstrate that the IT2FLS outperforms the T1FLS by more than 30% in terms of classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2172616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"224","endPage":"234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2172616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6176019","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6176019/06054028.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Tuning","Uncertainty","Training","Fuzzy sets","Pragmatics","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expert systems","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","object detection","parameter estimation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning","tuning","Gaussian interval type-2 fuzzy membership functions","lung CAD classification system","numerical information","pattern classification systems","parameter estimation","footprint of uncertainty","FOU","imperfect datasets","noisy datasets","Gaussian interval type-2 membership functions","IT2MFs","multidimensional pattern classification problems","genetic algorithm","GA","cross-validation techniques","chromosome initialization","interval type-2 fuzzy logic system","IT2FLS","nodule classification","lung computer-aided detection system","type-1 fuzzy logic system","T1FLS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","interval type-2 fuzzy set","learning","modeling uncertainty","tuning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Automatic Approach for Learning and Tuning Gaussian Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Membership Functions Applied to Lung CAD Classification System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054028/","volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6054028/","accessionNumber":"12639034","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatic Approach for Learning and Tuning Gaussian Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Membership Functions Applied to Lung CAD Classification System","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-hosseini-2172616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08015S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6176019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6176019","articleId":"6054028","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6054029,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Alberto Meda-Campana","affiliation":["Laboratory of Rotordynamics and Vibrations, Department of Mechanical Engineering, SEPIESIME Zacatenco, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6176019/6054029/6054029-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jes\u00fas Alberto Meda-Campa\u00f1a (M'08) was born in Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico in 1971.

These conditions are difficult to satisfy in general. In this paper, those conditions are relaxed by solving the fuzzy regulation problem directly on the overall T-S fuzzy model, instead of constructing the fuzzy regulator on the basis of linear local controllers. By considering the fuzzy model as a special class of linear time-varying systems, existence conditions are rigorously derived. These new conditions, which can be solved by means of any mathematical software, depend on the solution of a set of symbolic simultaneous linear equations depending on the membership values of the plant and/or the exosystem. Two examples are given to illustrate the construction of the proposed regulator and to validate the improvement that is achieved with the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems Described by Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2172689","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6176019/06054029.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2172689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6176019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6054029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Exact Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems Described by Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6054029/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639035","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems Described by Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Models","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-medacampana-2172689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091674S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6176019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6176019","articleId":"6054029","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6054033,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Camunas-Mesa","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6139293/6054033/6054033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luis Camu\u00f1as-Mesa was born in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, in 1979.

This is, the vision sensor (camera) is not capturing a sequence of still frames, as in conventional video and computer vision systems. In Event-Driven sensors each pixel autonomously and asynchronously decides when to send its address out. This way, the sensor output is a continuous stream of address events representing reality dynamically continuously and without constraining to frames. In this paper we present an Event-Driven Convolution Module for computing 2D convolutions on such event streams. The Convolution Module has been designed to assemble many of them for building modular and hierarchical Convolutional Neural Networks for robust shape and pose invariant object recognition. The Convolution Module has multi-kernel capability. This is, it will select the convolution kernel depending on the origin of the event. A proof-of-concept test prototype has been fabricated in a 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process and extensive experimental results are provided. The Convolution Processor has also been combined with an Event-Driven Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) for high-speed recognition examples. The chip can discriminate propellers rotating at 2 k revolutions per second, detect symbols on a 52 card deck when browsing all cards in 410 ms, or detect and follow the center of a phosphor oscilloscope trace rotating at 5 KHz.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2167409","startPage":"504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6139293/06054033.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2167409","endPage":"517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Event-Driven Multi-Kernel Convolution Processor Module for Event-Driven Vision Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"An Event-Driven Multi-Kernel Convolution Processor Module for Event-Driven Vision Sensors","volume":"47","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6054033/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12487871","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Event-Driven Multi-Kernel Convolution Processor Module for Event-Driven Vision Sensors","sourcePdf":"jssc-linaresbarranco-2167409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167396S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6139293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6139293","articleId":"6054033","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6054038,"authors":[{"name":"Jesus Cumana","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Elektrotechnik (ITHE), Rheinisch Westf\u00e4lische Technisc he Hochschule RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097085/6054038/6054038-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jesus Cumana (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Los Andes, Merida, Venezuela, in 2001, and the M.Sc. degree in microwave engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany, in 2004.","In 2004, he joined Bonn Elektronik, Ottobrunn, Germany, where he was involved in the development of RF power amplifiers.

In this paper, we present a novel gesture recognition approach for human computer interactivity based on marker-less upper body pose tracking in 3-D with multiple cameras. To achieve the robustness and real-time performance required for practical applications, the idea is to break the exponentially large search problem of upper body pose into two steps: first, the 3-D movements of upper body extremities (i.e., head and hands) are tracked. Then using knowledge of upper body model constraints, these extremities movements are used to infer the whole 3-D upper body motion as an inverse kinematics problem. Since the head and hand regions are typically well defined and undergo less occlusion, tracking is more reliable and could enable more robust upper body pose determination. Moreover, by breaking the problem of upper body pose tracking into two steps, the complexity is reduced considerably. Using pose tracking output, the gesture recognition is then done based on longest common subsequence similarity measurement of upper body joint angles dynamics. In our experiment, we provide an extensive validation of the proposed upper body pose tracking from 3-D extremity movement which showed good results with various subjects in different environments. Regarding the gesture recognition based on joint angles dynamics, our experimental evaluation of five subjects doing six upper body gestures with average classification accuracies over 90% indicates the promise and feasibility of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2172450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6133473/06054047.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2172450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Posture and Gesture Recognition for Interactivity in Smart Spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"3-D Posture and Gesture Recognition for Interactivity in Smart Spaces","volume":"8","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12486963","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6054047/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054047/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Posture and Gesture Recognition for Interactivity in Smart Spaces","sourcePdf":"tii-tran-2172450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079317S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6133473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6133473","articleId":"6054047","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6054048,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Hajiaboli","affiliation":["Center for Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6054048/6054048-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Reza Hajiaboli (S'06\u2013M'11) received the B.Eng. degree in computer engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, where he worked on characterizing the performance of complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor image sensors operating under a low illumination condition.

Instead, the crowd is segmented into components of homogeneous motion, using the mixture of dynamic-texture motion model. A set of holistic low-level features is extracted from each segmented region, and a function that maps features into estimates of the number of people per segment is learned with Bayesian regression. Two Bayesian regression models are examined. The first is a combination of Gaussian process regression with a compound kernel, which accounts for both the global and local trends of the count mapping but is limited by the real-valued outputs that do not match the discrete counts. We address this limitation with a second model, which is based on a Bayesian treatment of Poisson regression that introduces a prior distribution on the linear weights of the model. Since exact inference is analytically intractable, a closed-form approximation is derived that is computationally efficient and kernelizable, enabling the representation of nonlinear functions. An approximate marginal likelihood is also derived for kernel hyperparameter learning. The two regression-based crowd counting methods are evaluated on a large pedestrian data set, containing very distinct camera views, pedestrian traffic, and outliers, such as bikes or skateboarders. Experimental results show that regression-based counts are accurate regardless of the crowd size, outperforming the count estimates produced by state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Results on 2 h of video demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the regression-based crowd size estimation over long periods of time.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2172800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6170603/06054049.pdf","startPage":"2160","endPage":"2177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2172800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Counting People With Low-Level Features and Bayesian Regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6054049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054049/","displayDocTitle":"Counting People With Low-Level Features and Bayesian Regression","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12615434","pubMedId":"22020684","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6054049/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counting People With Low-Level Features and Bayesian Regression","sourcePdf":"tip-chan-2172800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124811S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"6170603","articleId":"6054049","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6054051,"authors":[{"name":"Hsu-Yung Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6054051/6054051-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsu-Yung Cheng (M'08) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

In this system, we escape from the stereotype and existing frameworks of vehicle detection in aerial surveillance, which are either region based or sliding window based. We design a pixelwise classification method for vehicle detection. The novelty lies in the fact that, in spite of performing pixelwise classification, relations among neighboring pixels in a region are preserved in the feature extraction process. We consider features including vehicle colors and local features. For vehicle color extraction, we utilize a color transform to separate vehicle colors and nonvehicle colors effectively. For edge detection, we apply moment preserving to adjust the thresholds of the Canny edge detector automatically, which increases the adaptability and the accuracy for detection in various aerial images. Afterward, a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is constructed for the classification purpose. We convert regional local features into quantitative observations that can be referenced when applying pixelwise classification via DBN. Experiments were conducted on a wide variety of aerial videos. The results demonstrate flexibility and good generalization abilities of the proposed method on a challenging data set with aerial surveillance images taken at different heights and under different camera angles.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2172798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6170603/06054051.pdf","startPage":"2152","endPage":"2159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2172798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Aerial Surveillance Using Dynamic Bayesian Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6054051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054051/","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Aerial Surveillance Using Dynamic Bayesian Networks","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12615436","pubMedId":"22020682","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6054051/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Detection in Aerial Surveillance Using Dynamic Bayesian Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-cheng-2172798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073881S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6170603","articleId":"6054051","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6054053,"authors":[{"name":"Priyam Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6054053/6054053-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Priyam Chatterjee (S'07) received the B.Tech. degree in information technology from the University of Kalyani, Kalyani, India, the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 2011.","He was an Intern with Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, in 2010 and is currently with Pelican Imaging Corporation, Mountain View, CA.

To quantitatively describe the user's walking intention, a concept called \u201cintentional direction (ITD)\u201d is proposed. Both the state model and the observation model of ITD are obtained by enumerating the possible walking modes and analyzing the relationship between the human-robot interaction force and the walking intention. From these two models, the user's walking intention can be online inferred using the Kalman filtering technique. Based on the estimated intention, a new admittance motion control scheme is proposed for the cane robot. Walking experiments aided by the cane robot on a flat ground and slope are carried out to validate the proposed control approach.

By applying this technique, a ML clamping unit (MCU) conveys additional levels for synthesizing the output waveforms of a diode-clamped ML dc-ac power converter. The basic building block of the ML clamping scheme is the ML clamping cell, which is composed of a pair of dc sources associated with one single-pole/triple-throw type of switch arrangement. The number of series-connected ML-clamping cells will set the number of levels of the synthesized waveform. By depending on the MCU arrangements, different converter configurations can be derived, namely, the common clamping and the modular types. Both approaches can be accomplished by employing classical three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) technology. Thus, the overall structure of the resultant converter is kept simple, wherein the number of parts count can be reduced, when compared with conventional NPC counterparts. In this letter, emphasis is given on the common clamping converter configuration. The attractiveness of the proposed ML concept is evidenced by conducting a comparative cost analysis. Experimental results are presented as a practicality proof of the proposed ML power converter.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/06054061.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel-Clamped Multilevel Converters (MLC-)","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6054061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel-Clamped Multilevel Converters (MLC<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^2$</tex></formula>)","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524222","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6054061/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel-Clamped Multilevel Converters (MLC<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^2$</tex></formula>)","sourcePdf":"tpel-rodriguez-2172224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131315S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"6054061","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6054064,"authors":[{"name":"Junsu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Korea Polytechnic University, Siheung, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6054064/6054064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junsu Kim (S'04\u2013M'10) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electric engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2001, 2003, and 2009, respectively.","From March 2009 to August 2009, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow sponsored by BK21 (Brain Korea 21) with KAIST.

In uplink CR systems, each secondary transmitter (CR user) has a spectrum sensing responsibility to protect the primary system, and the secondary receiver (base station) schedules the transmission opportunities for the CR users. We propose novel optimal and suboptimal scheduling schemes by simultaneously taking into account the spectrum sensing reliability and the data channel quality. Analytical performance results for the proposed suboptimal scheduling schemes show that the spectrum sensing reliability should be considered for scheduling to maximize the capacity of the secondary system. Moreover, we also analyze the achievable multiuser diversity (MUD) gain of one of the proposed suboptimal scheduling schemes, which is based on the linear combination of the sensing channel and the data channel qualities. We show that the MUD gain of uplink CR systems grows significantly slower than that of conventional multiuser systems, particularly if the quality of the sensing channel is poor. Analytical and simulation results confirm that the proposed optimal and suboptimal scheduling schemes taking into account the spectrum sensing reliability and the data channel quality yield significant performance gains compared with conventional opportunistic scheduling.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2172645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","startPage":"4349","endPage":"4362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06054064.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Spectrum Sensing Reliability on the Capacity of Multiuser Uplink Cognitive Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6054064/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Effect of Spectrum Sensing Reliability on the Capacity of Multiuser Uplink Cognitive Radio Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408183","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Spectrum Sensing Reliability on the Capacity of Multiuser Uplink Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-kim-2172645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092793S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6054064","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6054065,"authors":[{"name":"Ronny Yongho Kim","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Kyungil University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6054065/6054065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ronny Yongho Kim (M'06\u2013SM'10) received the B.S. degree from Inha University, Incheon, Korea, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.","From 1998 to 2010, he was a Senior Research Engineer with LG Electronics, where he was working on the research and standardization of future wireless technologies, primarily within the area of medium-access control (MAC) and network protocol design.

High BLER renders the system unreliable, and high PAPR is associated with power inefficiency and nonlinearity of the system. These two issues have separately been studied in the literature, but few works have studied simultaneous reductions of PAPR and BLER. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to jointly reduce and tradeoff PAPR and BLER in OFDM systems using random network coding (NC). In our proposed scheme, different representations of the input information block are generated using a special form of NC matrices, for which we prove it achieves the minimum BLER. We then propose an additional step to our proposed scheme to tradeoff a further improvement in PAPR against degradation in BLER using encoded block puncturing. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the same PAPR as conventional selective mapping (C-SLM) schemes while achieving the minimum BLER.

A series hybrid midsize sedan, utilizing a microturbine and a chargeable Li-ion battery stack as its primary energy source and energy storage system, respectively, is modeled in this paper. The equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is utilized to minimize the driving cost based on Pontryagin's minimum principle. To identify the equivalent factor (EF), a new concept called the energy ratio is defined, which is demonstrated to be closely related to the EF over all possible trips. By detecting the vehicle position with a telemetry system and measuring the battery state of charge (SOC), the EF is updated in real time and is used as an input for the computation of the ECMS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ECMS exhibits driving cost and diesel consumption equivalent to that determined from numerical dynamic programming. Significantly, the proposed approach reduces the driving cost from 7.7% to 21.6%, compared with a baseline control over both urban and highway cycles. In addition, through numerical simulations, the computational cost of the proposed strategy is demonstrated to be acceptable for industrial applications. Furthermore, because this strategy uses the feedback of the battery SOC, the control performance is insensitive to the control parameter errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054067/","volume":"60","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6054067/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408185","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management Control of Microturbine-Powered Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Using the Telemetry Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management Control of Microturbine-Powered Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Using the Telemetry Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy","sourcePdf":"tvt-sun-2172646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130119S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6054067","onlineDate":"19 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6054068,"authors":[{"name":"Rongrong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6054068/6054068-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rongrong Wang received the B.E. degree in control science and engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2006, the B.S. degree in economics from Nankai University, Tianjin, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009.

An adaptive control-based passive fault-tolerant controller is designed to ensure vehicle system stability and to track the desired vehicle motion when an in-wheel motor/motor driver fault happens. Due to the system actuation redundancy, it is challenging to isolate the faulty wheel and to accurately estimate the control gain of the faulty in-wheel motor/motor driver for 4WID electric vehicles. An active fault diagnosis (FD) approach is thus proposed to explicitly isolate and evaluate the fault. Based on the estimated control gain of the faulty wheel, the control efforts of all the wheels are redistributed to relieve the torque demand on the faulty wheel.

Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA) is a linear projective map that arises by solving the multimodal problem, which effectively combines the ideas of FDA and LPP. However, since the limited data pairs are employed to determine the discriminative ability, such local discriminative methods usually suffer from the maladjusted learning. To improve the discriminant ability of LFDA, this paper proposed an improved manifold learning method, called local and global marginal discriminant analysis (LGMDA), by incorporating the maximum margin criterion (MMC) for image recognition. As a result, the proposed method tries to find the sub manifold that best discriminates different classes and preserves the intrinsic relations of the local neighborhood in the same class according to prior class information. Experiments on the COIL-20 and YaleB images databases show the effectiveness of the proposed LGMDA.","doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2011.28","publicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization","pdfPath":"/iel5/6051728/6054070/06054094.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2011.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6054070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis with Maximum Margin Criterion for Image Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6054094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054094/","displayDocTitle":"Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis with Maximum Margin Criterion for Image Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317073","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6054094/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis with Maximum Margin Criterion for Image Recognition","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4484a092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091872S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6051728","isNumber":"6054070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6051728","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6054070","articleId":"6054094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6054096,"authors":[{"name":"Najah Muhammad","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Norah Bint Abdul Rahman University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Najah","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"38019073400"},{"name":"Muhammad Hussain","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37531877000"},{"name":"Ghulam Muhammad","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ghulam","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37395625800"},{"name":"George Bebis","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Bebis","id":"37267262500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0981-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4484-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6054096","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"abstract":"The issue of the verification of the authenticity and integrity of digital images is increasingly being important.

The non-intrusive approach for this problem is becoming attractive because it does not need any embedded information, but it is still far from being satisfactory. In this paper, an efficient non-intrusive method for copy-move forgery detection is presented. This method is based on image segmentation and similarity detection using dyadic wavelet transform (DyWT). Copied and pasted regions are structurally similar and this structural similarity is detected using DyWT and statistical measures.

Neural Network Classification for Panchromatic IKONOS Image Using Wavelet-Based Features","abstract":"Neural network has been increasingly used in remote sensing image classification in the last few decades. Nevertheless, an efficient method for high resolution remote sensing image classification, particularly panchromatic (PAN) image, is still under investigation. This work presents a neural network classification method for urban land cover mapping using the wavelet-based features extracted from a PAN IKONOS image. A structured-based neural network with back propagation through structure (BPTS) algorithm is conducted for image classification. After wavelet decomposition, the object's contents from the PAN image can be represented by its wavelet coefficients. The pixels' spectral intensity and the derived wavelet coefficients are combined as attributes for the tree representation in the neural network. With the designed neural network structure, a total of 2510 pixels of four land cover classes are selected as training data and 19498 pixels for the same land cover classes are selected for testing data. All the land cover classes are perfectly classified (100%) using the selected training data and the classification rate based on testing data set reaches to 99.68%. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method demonstrates a viable solution for classification of high resolution panchromatic remote sensing data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6054105/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12317084","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6054105/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Structure-Based Neural Network Classification for Panchromatic IKONOS Image Using Wavelet-Based Features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure-Based Neural Network Classification for Panchromatic IKONOS Image Using Wavelet-Based Features","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4484a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056414S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6051728","isNumber":"6054070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6051728","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6054070","articleId":"6054105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6055281,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this work, a new architecture is proposed to overcome these challenges by combining innovations in computation, memory, and communication, respectively, to leverage (a) robust digital neuron circuits; (b) novel transposable SRAM arrays that share learning circuits, which grow only with the number of neurons; and (c) crossbar fan-out for efficient on-chip inter-neuron communication. Through tight integration of memory (synapses) and computation (neurons), a highly configurable chip comprising 256 neurons and 64K binary synapses with on-chip learning based on spike-timing dependent plasticity is demonstrated in 45nm SOI-CMOS. Near-threshold, event-driven operation at 0.53V is demonstrated to maximize power efficiency for real-time pattern classification, recognition, and associative memory tasks. Future scalable systems built from the foundation provided by this work will open up possibilities for ubiquitous ultra-dense, ultra-low power brain-like cognitive computers.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2011.6055293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2011.6055293","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045019/6055276/06055293.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 45nm CMOS neuromorphic chip with a scalable architecture for learning in networks of spiking neurons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6055293/","displayDocTitle":"A 45nm CMOS neuromorphic chip with a scalable architecture for learning in networks of spiking neurons","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316468","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6055293/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 45nm CMOS neuromorphic chip with a scalable architecture for learning in networks of spiking neurons","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059119S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045019","isNumber":"6055276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045019","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"6055276","articleId":"6055293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6055294,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Merolla","affiliation":["IBM Research Almaden, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Merolla","id":"37424129300"},{"name":"John Arthur","affiliation":["IBM Research Almaden, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Arthur","id":"37425666300"},{"name":"Filipp Akopyan","affiliation":["IBM Research Almaden, USA","Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Filipp","lastName":"Akopyan","id":"37871603700"},{"name":"Nabil Imam","affiliation":["Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Imam","id":"38026821600"},{"name":"Rajit Manohar","affiliation":["Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Rajit","lastName":"Manohar","id":"37275630900"},{"name":"Dharmendra S.

To this end, we fabricated a key building block of a modular neuromorphic architecture, a neurosynaptic core, with 256 digital integrate-and-fire neurons and a 1024\u00d7256 bit SRAM crossbar memory for synapses using IBM's 45nm SOI process. Our fully digital implementation is able to leverage favorable CMOS scaling trends, while ensuring one-to-one correspondence between hardware and software. In contrast to a conventional von Neumann architecture, our core tightly integrates computation (neurons) alongside memory (synapses), which allows us to implement efficient fan-out (communication) in a naturally parallel and event-driven manner, leading to ultra-low active power consumption of 45pJ/spike. The core is fully configurable in terms of neuron parameters, axon types, and synapse states and is thus amenable to a wide range of applications. As an example, we trained a restricted Boltzmann machine offline to perform a visual digit recognition task, and mapped the learned weights to our chip.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055276","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045019/6055276/06055294.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2011.6055294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2011.6055294","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital neurosynaptic core using embedded crossbar memory with 45pJ per spike in 45nm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6055294/","displayDocTitle":"A digital neurosynaptic core using embedded crossbar memory with 45pJ per spike in 45nm","htmlLink":"/document/6055294/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12316469","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital neurosynaptic core using embedded crossbar memory with 45pJ per spike in 45nm","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.25185S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045019","isNumber":"6055276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045019","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"6055276","articleId":"6055294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6055296,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Kai Chan","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Kai","lastName":"Chan","id":"37288270200"},{"name":"Yu-Hsiang Tseng","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsiang","lastName":"Tseng","id":"38022883700"},{"name":"Pei-Kuei Tsung","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Kuei","lastName":"Tsung","id":"37321418400"},{"name":"Tzu-Der Chuang","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Der","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37409809600"},{"name":"Yi-Min Tsai","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Min","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37308170500"},{"name":"Wei-Yin Chen","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Yin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404858300"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Liang-Gee","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280381000"},{"name":"Shao-Yi Chien","affiliation":["Media IC & System Laboratory and DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-Yi","lastName":"Chien","id":"37279813300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0223-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0222-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0221-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"CD","value":"0886-5930"}],"articleNumber":"6055296","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"abstract":"A 5.877 TOPS/W Reconfigurable Smart-camera Stream Processor is implemented in 90nm CMOS technology.

It is experimentally demonstrated and analyzed on a 90 nm test chip.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055276","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045019/6055276/06055318.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2011.6055318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2011.6055318","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved circuits for microchip identification using SRAM mismatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6055318/","displayDocTitle":"Improved circuits for microchip identification using SRAM mismatch","htmlLink":"/document/6055318/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12316490","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved circuits for microchip identification using SRAM mismatch","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056898S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045019","isNumber":"6055276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045019","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6055276","articleId":"6055318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6055320,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Hin To","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Kun-Hin","lastName":"To","id":"37409103400"},{"name":"Vishal P.

Using a foundry-based 65nm bulk technology, high output power of 13.5dBm at 27\u00b0C and 10dBm at 125\u00b0C is demonstrated with a 1V supply. Output power variation across the operating temperature is about 4dB. It is achieved by merging two sets of transmission-line-based power matching network together for power combining at a single-ended output. A cross-coupled VCO together with a frequency doubler is used to provide more than 10GHz tuning range to cover process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. The 77GHz phase noise at the output is -87dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset.

The SIBO converter can provide a pair of positive and negative output voltages with only one external inductor for achieving the polarity reversion operation in Ch-LCD to obtain high-quality displays. The proposed AEC control decides energy distribution for bipolar outputs without any cross regulation through the embedded prediction function. The chip fabricated in a 0.25 \u03bcm CMOS process demonstrates near-zero cross-regulation at bipolar outputs with 90% peak power conversion efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2011.6055341","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045019/6055276/06055341.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2011.6055341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A near-zero cross-regulation single-inductor bipolar-output (SIBO) converter with an active-energy-correlation control for driving cholesteric-LCD","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A near-zero cross-regulation single-inductor bipolar-output (SIBO) converter with an active-energy-correlation control for driving cholesteric-LCD","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6055341/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316513","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6055341/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A near-zero cross-regulation single-inductor bipolar-output (SIBO) converter with an active-energy-correlation control for driving cholesteric-LCD","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068215S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045019","isNumber":"6055276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045019","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6055276","articleId":"6055341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6055346,"authors":[{"name":"Mrunmay Talegaonkar","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Mrunmay","lastName":"Talegaonkar","id":"38016600600"},{"name":"Rajesh Inti","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Inti","id":"37589975800"},{"name":"Pavan Kumar Hanumolu","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Pavan Kumar","lastName":"Hanumolu","id":"37277129200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0223-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0222-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0221-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"CD","value":"0886-5930"}],"articleNumber":"6055346","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3097},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Detectors","Bandwidth","Quantization","Transfer functions","Voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock and data recovery circuits","jitter","network synthesis","oscillators","phase detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter performance metrics","jitter generation","jitter transfer","jitter tolerance","digital CDR parameters","digital CDR design","digital phase detector nonlinearity","quantization error","digitally-controlled oscillator frequency quantization error","digital clock and data recovery circuit design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6055346","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045019/6055276/06055346.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2011.6055346","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2011.6055346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055276","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital clock and data recovery circuit design: Challenges and tradeoffs","abstract":"Digital clock and recovery circuits (CDRs) have recently emerged as an alternative to their more classical analog counterparts.

A first generation of transceivers, using several advances in new circuits and architectures, combined with extensive digital compensation techniques, are indeed able to operate over the complete range of both RF frequencies and baseband bandwidths and as such act like an SDR. However, a real SDR must go further than this. Interoperability and coexistence scenarios, combined with the need to eliminate external fixed-frequency acoustic RF filters, lead to much more stringent requirements on linearity and noise. Therefore, this paper will also present a novel second generation of 40nm CMOS transceivers that enable this. On the TX side, it is crucial to achieve -160dBc/Hz noise level for all possible combinations of RF frequency, baseband bandwidth, and RX-TX duplex spacing. In the receiver, extremely linear circuits are presented, that are able to handle blockers of around 0dBm input level.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2011.6055349","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045019/6055276/06055349.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2011.6055349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAW-less software-defined radio transceivers in 40nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SAW-less software-defined radio transceivers in 40nm CMOS","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6055349/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316521","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6055349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAW-less software-defined radio transceivers in 40nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054144S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045019","isNumber":"6055276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045019","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6055276","articleId":"6055349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6055357,"authors":[{"name":"Dragomir Milojevic","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dragomir","lastName":"Milojevic","id":"38559284500"},{"name":"Herman Oprins","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Herman","lastName":"Oprins","id":"37400793700"},{"name":"Julien Ryckaert","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Ryckaert","id":"37282160900"},{"name":"Paul Marchal","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Marchal","id":"37265044400"},{"name":"Geert Van der Plas","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Van der Plas","id":"38237176400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0223-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0222-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0221-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"CD","value":"0886-5930"}],"articleNumber":"6055357","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6055357","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Random access memory","Three dimensional displays","Materials","Performance evaluation","Through-silicon vias","Temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","DRAM chips","logic circuits","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pathfinding flow","DRAM-on-logic stack","thermal characterization","mechanical characterization","holistic optimization","working 3D stack","TSV-\u03bcbump layout","fine-tuned together","support system designer","OSAT","calibration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D","Characterization","Design flow"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present thermal and mechanical characterization of a DRAM-on-logic stack.

Discussion of the evolution of optical communications technology highlights salient features of guided wave optical technology. Attributes of silicon photonics indicate how the most desirable features of optical communications can be cost effectively implemented on-chip using already demonstrated silicon photonic components. Results of an experimental investigation of effects of fabrication and runtime variations on photonic device operation are presented. Variation tolerant system design rules are discussed. Attention is placed on motivating why silicon photonics is the replacement for copper interconnection that offers the best possibility for future improvement in performance and reduction in power consumption. The broadcast interconnection effort being carried in the author's research group is discussed in light of the requirements of many-core interconnections.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2011.6055360","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045019/6055276/06055360.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2011.6055360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon photonics for on-chip interconnections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6055360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Silicon photonics for on-chip interconnections","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6055360/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12316531","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6055360/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon photonics for on-chip interconnections","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091369S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045019","isNumber":"6055276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045019","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6055276","articleId":"6055360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6055361,"authors":[{"name":"Siavash Fallahi","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Siavash","lastName":"Fallahi","id":"37390466200"},{"name":"Delong Cui","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Delong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37990061300"},{"name":"Deyi Pi","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Deyi","lastName":"Pi","id":"37286405400"},{"name":"Rose Zhu","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rose","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38025902500"},{"name":"Greg Unruh","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Unruh","id":"38016597600"},{"name":"Marcel Lugthart","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Lugthart","id":"37275710500"},{"name":"Afshin Momtaz","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Momtaz","id":"37300222200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0223-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0222-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0221-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"CD","value":"0886-5930"}],"articleNumber":"6055361","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":776},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Jitter","Finite impulse response filter","Phase locked loops","Noise","Receivers","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","jitter","low-power electronics","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Serdes transceiver","SFI-5.1 application","low power transceiver","small area transceiver","CMOS","sinusoidal input jitter","wavelength 40 nm","power 19 mW","bit rate 50 Gbit/s","bit rate 3.125 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SFI-5.1","SerDes","transceivers and ADPLL"]}],"abstract":"A low-power, small-area transceiver PHY that supports SFI-5.1 is fabricated in standard 40 nm CMOS, supporting rates up to 50 Gb/s.

potential (SP, 200Hz~10kHz). SP signal has been the focus of physiological studies. Recent study shows that the LFP signal plays important roles in modulating many profound cellular mechanisms. Although many bio-signal acquisition circuits have been reported over the years, few designs are applicable for both LFP and SP signals. To record both signals accurately, acquisition circuits need low noise and good linearity in both bands. In this paper, we report the design of a dual-band acquisition IC for microelectrode array (MEA) recording. The novel design uses a continuous-time (CT) front-end with chopping to suppress the noise, and a discrete-time (DT) back-end to achieve good linearity. A prototype monolithic acquisition IC is fabricated in a 0.35um CMOS process. It has 16 acquisition channels and a 11bit successive-approximation (SAR) ADC. Every channel achieves 38.6nV/Hz\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.5</sup>\n noise and <;60;0.1% nonlinearity.

For MEA recording, the new design has high input impedance (320M\u03a9@ 1kHz). The fully differential design has high CMRR (>;110dB) and PSRR (>;110dB). NEF of the new design is 6.4.

The sensor is able to operate at triple modes: temporal difference mode, normal full frame intensity mode and region of interest (ROI) intensity mode. Each pixel is equipped with an analog memory (capacitor) and the whole array is hence capable of storing the previous frame. The rows are sequentially selected for readout and frame difference is digitalized into binary events using a global differentiator. An on-chip hardware-implemented clustering-based algorithm processes the events on the fly and localizes moving objects in the scene.

From the nonvolatile and reliable characteristics of our RRAM device, unlike that of SRAM devices, it holds promise to enable reconfigurable logic applications with significantly reduced logic-gate density and power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2011.2168376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2011.2168376","endPage":"1667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/6079317/06056548.pdf","startPage":"1665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility Study of - Resistive Random Access Memory in an Inverter Circuit for FPGA Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056548/","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility Study of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{Mo/SiO}_{x}/\\hbox{Pt}$</tex></formula> Resistive Random Access Memory in an Inverter Circuit for FPGA Applications","volume":"32","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"12376649","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6056548/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility Study of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{Mo/SiO}_{x}/\\hbox{Pt}$</tex></formula> Resistive Random Access Memory in an Inverter Circuit for FPGA Applications","sourcePdf":"led-park-2168376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080774S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6079317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6079317","articleId":"6056548","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6056550,"authors":[{"name":"Omer Bayraktar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142637/6056550/6056550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omer Bayraktar was born in Aydin, Turkey, in 1983.

To overcome the constraint on the knowledge of the system model, we have used local models that are related to some operating points to synthesize a type-2 nominal fuzzy global model. The control is based on the super-twisting algorithm, which is among second-order sliding-mode controls (SMCs). Moreover, two adaptive fuzzy type-2 systems have been introduced to generate the two super-twisting signals to avoid both the chattering and the constraint on the knowledge of disturbances and uncertainties upper bounds. These adaptive fuzzy type-2 systems are adjusted online by two adaptation laws that are deduced from the stability analysis in the Lyapunov sense. It has only one input, i.e., the sliding surface, and one output, i.e., the optimal values of the gains control, which are hard to compute with the original algorithm. Many results of the one-link manipulator are obtained: first by the simulation in order to compare the performances of the proposed method with that given by Levant and then in a real-time application in order to confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach. The experimentation and simulation are done for the tracking control problem.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2172948","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6176019/06056561.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6176019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2172948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"262","endPage":"275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-Order Sliding Fuzzy Interval Type-2 Control for an Uncertain System With Real Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Second-Order Sliding Fuzzy Interval Type-2 Control for an Uncertain System With Real Application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056561/","volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6056561/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639037","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-Order Sliding Fuzzy Interval Type-2 Control for an Uncertain System With Real Application","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-manceur-2172948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087406S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6176019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6176019","articleId":"6056561","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6056563,"authors":[{"name":"Emidio DiGiampaolo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6191366/6056563/6056563-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emidio DiGiampaolo received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in applied electromagnetics from the University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy, in 1994 and 1998, respectively.","From 1998 to 2004, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the University of L'Aquila.

RFID tags are placed at the ceiling of the environment and can be detected by a mobile robot unit traveling below them. The detection of the tags is the only information used in the proposed approach (no distance or bearing to the tag is considered available), but differently from similar localization setups reported in the literature, only a small number (about one each square meter or less) of tags are used. This is possible using a suitable tag's antenna in ultrahigh frequency band, expressly designed to obtain regular and stable RFID detection regions, which allows us to consider an efficient Kalman filtering approach to fuse RFID readings with the vehicle odometry data. A satisfactory performance is achieved, with an average position error of about 0.1 m. The hardware/software localization setup described in this paper is cheap and easy to use and may provide a satisfactory approach in several industrial and domestic scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6056563/","accessionNumber":"12692380","displayDocTitle":"A Passive UHF-RFID System for the Localization of an Indoor Autonomous Vehicle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Passive UHF-RFID System for the Localization of an Indoor Autonomous Vehicle","sourcePdf":"tie-martinelli-2173091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077521S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6191366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6191366","articleId":"6056563","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6056565,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099844/6056565/6056565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Meng (M'03) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China, in 1991 and 1994, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, in 2000.","She has been a Senior Engineer in several companies since 2000, and then Joined Jackson State University, Jackson, MS, as an Assistant Professor in computer engineering in 2003.

However, the capability of SNNs in solving complex real-world problems remains to be demonstrated. In this paper, we propose a substantial extension of the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) SNN model, in which the plasticity parameters are regulated by a gene regulatory network (GRN). Meanwhile, the dynamics of the GRN is dependent on the activation levels of the BCM neurons. We term the whole model \u201cGRN-BCM.\u201d To demonstrate its computational power, we first compare the GRN-BCM with a standard BCM, a hidden Markov model, and a reservoir computing model on a complex time series classification problem. Simulation results indicate that the GRN-BCM significantly outperforms the compared models. The GRN-BCM is then applied to two widely used datasets for human behavior recognition. Comparative results on the two datasets suggest that the GRN-BCM is very promising for human behavior recognition, although the current experiments are still limited to the scenarios in which only one object is moving in the considered video sequences.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2171044","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2171044","startPage":"1952","endPage":"1966","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099844/06056565.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056565/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Activity-Dependent Plasticity in BCM Spiking Neural Networks With Application to Human Behavior Recognition","volume":"22","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"12409288","pubMedId":"22027373","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6056565/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Activity-Dependent Plasticity in BCM Spiking Neural Networks With Application to Human Behavior Recognition","sourcePdf":"tnn-jin-pt1-2171044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139671S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6099844","articleId":"6056565","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6056568,"authors":[{"name":"Na Kong","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6056568/6056568-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Na Kong (S\u201908) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in biomedical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, in 2011.","Her main research interests include power management circuit design for energy harvesting and digital control for switched-mode power supplies."]},"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Kong","id":"37406156400"},{"name":"Dong Sam Ha","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6056568/6056568-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Sam Ha (M\u201986\u2013SM\u201997\u2013F\u201908) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1974, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 1984 and 1986, respectively.","Prior to his graduation, he was with the Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, Korea, for five years.

Several low-power design schemes to reduce power dissipation of the proposed system are described, and sources of power loss are analyzed to improve the power efficiency. A discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) flyback converter with the constant on-time modulation is adopted for our system. The DCM operation of a flyback converter is chosen as for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to be implemented with a single current sensor. The constant on-time modulation lowers the clock frequency of the controller by more than an order of magnitude for our system, which reduces the dynamic power dissipation of the controller. MPPT, executed by a microcontroller unit (MCU), is achieved through dynamic resistive matching, and the MPPT is executed at intermittent time intervals due to a relatively slow change of the operating condition. When MPPT is not active, the MCU operates at a lower clock frequency to save power. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system harvests up to 8.4 mW power under 0.5-g base acceleration with four parallel piezoelectric cantilevers and achieves 72% power efficiency around the resonant frequency of 47 Hz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056568/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","volume":"27","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12571267","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6056568/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Design of a Self-powered Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting System With Maximum Power Point Tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power Design of a Self-powered Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting System With Maximum Power Point Tracking","sourcePdf":"tpel-kong-2172960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088242S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6159241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6159241","articleId":"6056568","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6056569,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Safaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada","Canada Bombardier Transportation, Inc., Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6056569/6056569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Safaee (S\u201908) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in physics from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi, QC, Canada in 1997, 1999 and 2009, respectively.","From 1997 to 2005, he was a Design Engineer and later a Design Manager at Manabe Taghzyeh Electronic Company, Tehran, Iran, where his teams developed several types of chargers, inverters, stabilizers, and UPS systems for more than 1000 communication sites and power plants.

The snubber provides zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for the main switches of the entire power converter blocks in the entire input voltages and polarities. To achieve ZVS operation, the snubber block extracts the energy of the main switch drain-source capacitors and delivers it to the high-voltage side. Moreover, the snubber switches have zero-current switching (ZCS) turn-on and ZVS turn-off transitions. The performance of the proposed converter system is evaluated on a prototype including two converter blocks of 500 W working at 150 kHz with an input-voltage range of 110 V (-30% to +20%) and output of 175 V. Experimental results confirm that the proposed snubber improves the efficiency by 3% (4%) at half (full) load power for the entire input-voltage range.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6159241/06056569.pdf","startPage":"2260","endPage":"2272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiblock Soft-Switched Bidirectional AC\u2013AC Converter Using a Single Loss-Less Active Snubber Block","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056569/","displayDocTitle":"Multiblock Soft-Switched Bidirectional AC\u2013AC Converter Using a Single Loss-Less Active Snubber Block","volume":"27","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6056569/","publicationDate":"May 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571268","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiblock Soft-Switched Bidirectional AC\u2013AC Converter Using a Single Loss-Less Active Snubber Block","sourcePdf":"tpel-safaee-2172959-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085793S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6159241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6159241","articleId":"6056569","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6056580,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Yen Leow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK","Wireless Communication Centre, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia"],"bio":{"p":["Chee Yen Leow (S'08), photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Chee Yen","lastName":"Leow","id":"37589805800"},{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Zhiguo Ding (S'03\u2013M'05), photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278653500"},{"name":"Kin K.

Connecting the central unit to remote antenna units, radio over fiber (RoF) links become essential parts of the DAS. One of the major problems in the RoF links is the nonlinear distortion experienced in its optoelectronic devices. This paper considers the adaptive compensation of the nonlinear RoF link. In particular, we present an extension to the conventional least-mean-square algorithm for memory-polynomial-based predistortion. In addition, we study different combinations of the algorithms for the predistortion. Moreover, we implement the adaptive predistorter in hardware, build a real RoF link, and verify the performance by measurements. The results demonstrate that distortion of the RoF link can be considerably diminished with a low complexity design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6155677/06056586.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predistortion of Radio Over Fiber Links: Algorithms, Implementation, and Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Least squares approximation","Predistortion","OFDM","Modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","distortion","least mean squares methods","polynomials","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio over fiber links predistortion","distributed antenna systems","DAS","high-data-rate wireless communications","RoF links","nonlinear distortion","least-mean-square algorithm","memory-polynomial-based predistortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive compensation","field programmable gate array (FPGA)","least mean square (LMS)","radio over fiber","recursive least squares (RLS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Predistortion of Radio Over Fiber Links: Algorithms, Implementation, and Measurements","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6056586/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556353","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predistortion of Radio Over Fiber Links: Algorithms, Implementation, and Measurements","sourcePdf":"tcsi-hekkala-2167267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110163S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6155677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6155677","articleId":"6056586","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6056587,"authors":[{"name":"Kenle Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Birck Nano Technology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097085/6056587/6056587-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kenle Chen (S'10) received the Bachelor's degree in communication engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2005, the Master's degree in electronics and information engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China in 2008, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.","From 2007 to 2008, he was with the Institute of Micro Electronics, National Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Fabrication, Peking University, where his research focused on RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches, tunable filters, and vacuum packaging.

Furthermore, the Class-E PA is characterized through measurements using constant-envelop global system for mobile communications signals, indicating a favorable adjacent channel power ratio from -40 to -50 dBc within the entire bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2169080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6097085/06056587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2169080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097085","startPage":"3162","endPage":"3173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Highly Efficient Broadband Class-E Power Amplifier Using Synthesized Low-Pass Matching Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Highly Efficient Broadband Class-E Power Amplifier Using Synthesized Low-Pass Matching Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408771","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6056587/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Highly Efficient Broadband Class-E Power Amplifier Using Synthesized Low-Pass Matching Networks","sourcePdf":"tmtt-chen-2169080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061305S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"6097085","articleId":"6056587","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6056589,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6268389/6056589/6056589-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Wang (S'06) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, San Diego, in 2008, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, San Diego.","His current research interests include the architecture and scheduling algorithms for high-speed switching and routing, robust memory system design, network measurement, large deviation principle, and coding and information theory."]},"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292557600"},{"name":"Haiquan Zhao","affiliation":["Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA","College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6268389/6056589/6056589-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Haiquan (Chuck) Zhao received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2010.","He is currently working as a Software Engineer with Microsoft, Redmond, WA."]},"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37402332000"},{"name":"Bill Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6268389/6056589/6056589-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Bill Lin (M'97) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1985, 1988, and 1991, respectively.","He is currently a Professor of electrical and computer engineering and an Adjunct Professor of computer science and engineering with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

This problem arises in a variety of router management and data streaming applications where large arrays of counters are used to track various network statistics and implement various counting sketches. It proves too costly to store such large counter arrays entirely in SRAM, while DRAM is viewed as too slow for providing wirespeed updates at such high line rates. In particular, we propose a DRAM-based counter architecture that can effectively maintain wirespeed updates to large counter arrays. The proposed approach is based on the observation that modern commodity DRAM architectures, driven by aggressive performance roadmaps for consumer applications, such as video games, have advanced architecture features that can be exploited to make a DRAM-based solution practical. In particular, we propose a randomized DRAM architecture that can harness the performance of modern commodity DRAM offerings by interleaving counter updates to multiple memory banks. The proposed architecture makes use of a simple randomization scheme, a small cache, and small request queues to statistically guarantee a near-perfect load-balancing of counter updates to the DRAM banks. The statistical guarantee of the proposed randomized scheme is proven using a novel combination of convex ordering and large deviation theory. Our proposed counter scheme can support arbitrary increments and decrements at wirespeed, and they can support different number representations, including both integer and floating point number representations.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6268389/06056589.pdf","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2171360","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2171360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRAM-Based Statistics Counter Array Architecture With Performance Guarantee","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"DRAM-Based Statistics Counter Array Architecture With Performance Guarantee","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056589/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6056589/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","volume":"20","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRAM-Based Statistics Counter Array Architecture With Performance Guarantee","sourcePdf":"tnet-wang-2171360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132936S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6268389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6268389","articleId":"6056589","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6056591,"authors":[{"name":"Fariborz Musavi","affiliation":["Research Department, Delta-Q Technologies Corporation, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6155182/6056591/6056591-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fariborz Musavi (S'10\u2013M'11) received the B.Sc. degree from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1994, the M.Sc. degree from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering with emphasis in power electronics from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","Since 2001, he has been with several high-tech companies including EMS Technologies Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada, DRS Pivotal Power, Bedford, NS, Canada and Alpha Technologies, Bellingham, WA, USA.

The topology survey is focused on several boost power factor corrected converters, which offer high efficiency, high power factor, high density, and low cost. Experimental results are presented and interpreted for five prototype converters, converting universal ac input voltage to 400 V dc. The results demonstrate that the phase shifted semi-bridgeless PFC boost converter is ideally suited for automotive level I residential charging applications in North America, where the typical supply is limited to 120 V and 1.44 kVA or 1.92 kVA. For automotive level II residential charging applications in North America and Europe the bridgeless interleaved PFC boost converter is an ideal topology candidate for typical supplies of 240 V, with power levels of 3.3 kW, 5 kW, and 6.6 kW.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/06056591.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2166413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2166413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation and Efficiency Comparison of Front End AC-DC Plug-in Hybrid Charger Topologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Batteries","Prototypes","Reactive power","Power generation","Bridge circuits","Semiconductor diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","battery chargers","battery powered vehicles","hybrid electric vehicles","power factor correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plug-in hybrid electric vehicle","front-end AC-DC converter","PHEV battery chargers","topology survey","power factor correction","phase shifted semi-bridgeless converter","PFC boost converter","automotive level I residential charging","automotive level II residential charging","voltage 120 V","apparent power 1.44 kVA","voltage 240 V","power 3.3 kW","power 5 kW","power 6.6 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC-DC power converters","DC-DC power converters","power conversion","power electronics","power quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation and Efficiency Comparison of Front End AC-DC Plug-in Hybrid Charger Topologies","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6056591/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543439","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation and Efficiency Comparison of Front End AC-DC Plug-in Hybrid Charger Topologies","sourcePdf":"tsg-musavi-2166413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078354S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6056591","onlineDate":"20 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6056684,"authors":[{"name":"Bjorn A.

The technology has evolved from early voice only services to today's mobile wireless broadband (Internet) data delivery. The increasing use of wireless connectivity via smartphones and laptops has led to an exponential surge in network traffic. Meeting traffic demands will cause a significant increase in operator energy cost as an enlarged network of radio base stations will be needed to support mobile broadband effectively and maintain operational competitiveness. This article explores approaches that will assist in delivering significant energy efficiency gains in future wireless networks, easing the burden on network operators.

Meeting the rapidly increasing demand for more capacity in wireless broadband access will further increase the energy consumption. Operators are now facing both investing in denser and denser networks as well as increased energy cost. Traditional design paradigms, based on assumptions of spectrum shortage and high cost base station sites, have produced current cellular systems based on 3G and 4G (LTE) standards. The latter ones are characterized by very high spectrum efficiency, but low energy efficiency. Deployment has favored strategies with few high-power bases stations with complex antenna systems. The key method for indoor coverage has so far been to literally \"blast signals through walls\" - a solution that is neither energy-efficient nor very sound from a radiation perspective. As environmental aspects may be perceived as important from a societal perspective, the cost remains the short- to medium-term concern for operators of future mobile broadband systems. What becomes evident now is that the so far mostly neglected energy cost will be a major concern. Future system deployment has to balance infrastructure deployment, spectrum, and energy cost components. Ongoing incremental improvements in electronics and signal processing are bringing down the power consumption in the base station. However, these improvements are not enough to match the orders-of-magnitude increase in energy consumption cause by demands for more capacity. It is clear that solutions to this problem have to be found at the architectural level, not just by increasing the efficiency of individual components. In this article we propose a framework for a total cost analysis and survey some recent, more radical, \"clean slate\" approaches exploiting combinations of new spectrum opportunities, energy-efficient PHY layers, and novel deployment and backhauling strategies that target minimizing overall system cost. The latter involve network deployment tightly tailored to traffic requirements, using low-power micro base stations tailored specifically to decrease the power consumption compared to today's highpower macro base station schemes. To illustrate our findings, a power consumption model for mobile broadband access networks taking backhaul into account is presented, and the main trade-offs between infrastructure, energy, and spectrum costs are analyzed. We demonstrate optimal deployment strategies in some simple scenarios where a certain capacity has to be provided in a dense interference-limited scenario.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.6056688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6056680/06056688.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.6056688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056680","startPage":"18","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy- and cost-efficient ultra-high-capacity wireless access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy- and cost-efficient ultra-high-capacity wireless access","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12315687","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6056688/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy- and cost-efficient ultra-high-capacity wireless access","sourcePdf":"008TOMBAZLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042035S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6056680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6056680","articleId":"6056688","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6056689,"authors":[{"name":"Zhisheng Niu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhisheng Niu [M] (niuzhs@tsinghua.edu.cn) graduated from Northern Jiaotong University (currently Beijing Jiaotong University), China, in 1985, and got his M.E. and D.E. degrees from Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.

It is argued that under the green network paradigm powered by renewable energy, the fundamental design criterion and main performance metric have shifted from energy efficiency to energy sustainability. As an effort to this end, in this article, new network solutions are proposed with an objective of improving network sustainability; the proposed solutions ensure that dynamically harvested energy can sustain the traffic demands in the network. Specifically, the placement issue of green access points (i.e., APs powered by sustainable energy sources) is investigated to meet the energy and QoS demands of mobile users; and an adaptive resource management scheme is proposed to address the unreliability of renewable energy in QoS provisioning. It is shown that by mitigating the energy depletion probability of green APs, sustainable network performance can be significantly improved.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.6056693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6056680/06056693.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.6056693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimensioning network deployment and resource management in green mesh networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056693/","displayDocTitle":"Dimensioning network deployment and resource management in green mesh networks","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12315692","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6056693/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensioning network deployment and resource management in green mesh networks","sourcePdf":"013CAILAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052952S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6056680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6056680","articleId":"6056693","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6056694,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Attar","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Alireza Attar [m08] (attar@ece.ubc.ca) has been a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia since 2009.

This trend is referred to as green radio communications. In this article, network cooperation is investigated as a means of energy saving. Networks with overlapped coverage can cooperate to reduce their energy consumption by alternately switching on and off their resources according to the traffic load conditions. We present an optimal resource on-off switching framework that adapts to the fluctuations in the traffic load and maximizes the amount of energy saving under service quality constraints in a cooperative networking environment. For the system model under consideration, unlike the existing solutions in the literature, the proposed technique can achieve energy saving while avoiding an increase in transmission power. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.6056695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6056680/06056695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.6056695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056680","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network cooperation for energy saving in green radio communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6056695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network cooperation for energy saving in green radio communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6056695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12315694","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6056695/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network cooperation for energy saving in green radio communications","sourcePdf":"015ISMAILLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050826S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6056680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6056680","articleId":"6056695","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6056712,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Ge","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6056707/6056712/6056712-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guang Ge was born in Wuhan, China, on March 31, 1985.

Although many existing face recognition methods have achieved success in real application, but can not be directly used to the single training image scenario. The associative memory neural networks provide a feasible strategy to address such problem. In this paper, we first briefly review the existing single training sample face recognition algorithms, and then propose a new multiple value auto-associative memory neural network by modifying evolution rule and activation function. Finally, experiments on the two publicly available face databases are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057185","startPage":"4947","endPage":"4950","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034697/6056741/06057185.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust face recognition from single training image per person via auto-associative memory neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Training","Databases","Artificial neural networks","Image recognition","Associative memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","face recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single training image per person","auto-associative memory neural network","appearance-based pattern recognition field","single training sample face recognition algorithms","evolution rule","activation function","face databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","Associative memory","Face recgonition","Appearance-based pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6057185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust face recognition from single training image per person via auto-associative memory neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6057185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12354940","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust face recognition from single training image per person via auto-associative memory neural network","confLoc":"Yichang, China","sourcePdf":"CE63959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045057S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034697","isNumber":"6056741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034697","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6056741","articleId":"6057185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6057217,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Tang","affiliation":["College of Information, ZhongKai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Tang","id":"38023535900"},{"name":"Xiao-lan Lv","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-lan","lastName":"Lv","id":"38031263800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8162-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8164-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6057217","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1036},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Binary phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Digital modulation","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","error statistics","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BPSK","BDPSK simulator","Matlab","modulation principle","SNR","BER","incoherent demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BPSK","BDPSK","BER","SNR"]}],"abstract":"The paper introduces the basic modulation and demodulation principle of BPSK and BDPSK.

The analysis result demonstrates that if the phase difference between system voltage of access point and voltage of STATCOM satisfies some condition, STATCOM can provide maximal positive damping.

For a Cognitive Radio network where the spectrum is owned by Primary Users (PUs) that have a Markovian traffic, Secondary Users are allowed to share these spectral resources using the Time Division Multiple Access method based on the Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing. Each Secondary User (SU) is assigned one time slot where he usually transmits. The given model allows each SU to transmit in the remaining slots if he has data to transfer and has missed his own slot. Therefore, packets are not only lost by reason of Primary traffic interruptions, but also we consider losses caused by collisions between several SUs due to our specific time slot allocation. We use a duplication-based approach to setup up many Secondary User Links (SULs) in order to minimize the collision effects. Numerical simulations, in view of the Spectral Efficiency, show that the system still exhibit good secondary traffic robustness despite of the presence of primary interferences and secondary collisions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056741","startPage":"5987","endPage":"5991","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034697/6056741/06057253.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markovian primary traffics in Cognitive Radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6057253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6057253/","displayDocTitle":"Markovian primary traffics in Cognitive Radio networks","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12355008","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markovian primary traffics in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Yichang, China","sourcePdf":"CE82862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068364S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034697","isNumber":"6056741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034697","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6056741","articleId":"6057253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6057254,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhong Yan","affiliation":["Department of Computer, North China Institute of Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenzhong","lastName":"Yan","id":"38024861300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8162-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8164-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6057254","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6057254","abstract":"Automated chromosome classification has been an important pattern recognition problem for decades.

The high impedance fault simulation system was built based upon the study of the various transient signals in power systems, and the high impedance fault simulation analysis of the distribution feeder was undertaken through PSCAD simulation platform using high impedance fault model.

The preferential knowledge of the various objective functions considered herein is known a priori. The first objective function (minimization of out-of-service area) has been kept at the first preference. The objective function of minimization of manually controlled switch operations has been kept at the second preference and that of minimization of remotely controlled switch operations has been kept at the third preference. Finally, the objective function of minimization of losses has been kept at the fourth preference. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied in solving the service restoration problem in an electric power distribution system. In contrast to the single objective function optimization approach, it does good in solving conflicting objective functions and constraints in the service restoration problem. And due to the introduction of front formation and elitism, the approach has a faster speed and reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057442","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034697/6056741/06057442.pdf","startPage":"3624","endPage":"3627","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service restoration reconfiguration in distribution networks based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6057442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Service restoration reconfiguration in distribution networks based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12342680","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service restoration reconfiguration in distribution networks based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Yichang, China","sourcePdf":"CE32300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03459S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","isNumber":"6056741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034697","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6057442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6057513,"authors":[{"name":"WenChao Chang","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, ShiJiaZhang, China"],"firstName":"WenChao","lastName":"Chang","id":"38021383700"},{"name":"Weijun Wang","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, ShiJiaZhang, China"],"firstName":"Weijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38025817900"},{"name":"HuiRan Jia","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, ShiJiaZhang, China"],"firstName":"HuiRan","lastName":"Jia","id":"38019352900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8162-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8164-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6057513","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6057513","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear dynamical systems","Stochastic processes","Heuristic algorithms","Mathematical model","Adaptation models","Aerodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function networks","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis functions neural network","learning rate","stochastic U-model","adaptive tracking control algorithm","online control algorithm","RBFNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["U-model","On-line estimation","Nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems","Time varying parameters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057513","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034697/6056741/06057513.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","startPage":"278","endPage":"281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radial basis functions neural network of vary learning rate based stochastic U-model","abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive tracking control algorithm and its step by step implementation procedure are developed for a class of nonlinear plants within a U-model framework with unknown parameters.

However, the output power of photovoltaic power system has the property of uncertainties. In order to lighten the adverse influence for power grid, this paper attempts a method based on Grey combination model to forecast the short-term power output of a PV power system. The proposed method is a combination of grey model and BP neural network model. It takes the main factors of power output of photovoltaic power system into consideration and builds GM(1,1) model by choosing proper samples, and then builds the BP Neutral Network model using residual error series between fitted values and real values, finally modifies the GM(1,1) value. The result of test example shows that the Grey combination model can efficiently predict the short-term power output for photovoltaic system and has a potential value in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057634","startPage":"4623","endPage":"4626","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056741","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034697/6056741/06057634.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photovoltaic system power forecasting based on combined grey model and BP neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6057634/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Photovoltaic system power forecasting based on combined grey model and BP neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6057634/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12376063","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photovoltaic system power forecasting based on combined grey model and BP neural network","confLoc":"Yichang, China","sourcePdf":"CE50983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061624S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034697","isNumber":"6056741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034697","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6056741","articleId":"6057634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6057668,"authors":[{"name":"Li Su","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Research Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Su","id":"38017714900"},{"name":"Li Ning","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Research Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ning","id":"37089115357"},{"name":"Wang Yue","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Research Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yue","id":"37530312600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8162-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8164-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6057668","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6057668","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Switches","Modulation","Voltage control","Reactive power","Capacitors","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","power engineering computing","PWM power convertors","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC voltage balancing scheme","reference-decomposition SVPWM","multilevel diode clamped converter","multilevel DCC","high-voltage applications","object function optimizing scheme","DC current model","five-level diode-clamped converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multilevel","DC voltage balancing","space vector modulation(SVM)","reference-decomposition"]}],"abstract":"Multilevel diode clamped converter (DCC) has gained more and more focus nowadays due to its adaptability to high power and high-voltage applications.

Because of sophisticated NOx sensors are becoming a critical cost challenge to OEMs, open loop SCR is mainly used at present, and which lead to be difficultly adaptive to control emission reduction and calibration workload was heavy. Lean combustion technique for gasoline was applied, which lead to NOx gas obvious increase and needed NOx sensor to detect NOx concentration. This paper describes an approach for replacing the engine out NOx sensor with an artificial neural network (ANN) based NOx perception. A multi-layer perception network was trained to estimate NOx concentration from engine speed, load, exhaust temperature, and oxidation factor information. This supervised learning was conducted with measured engine data. The network was validated against measured data that was excluded from the training data set. The paper details application of this technique to a heavy duty diesel engine. Results show good agreement between predictions and measured data under the steady state conditions studied. The methodology will also be evaluated for use under transient operation, and over the operating lifetime of the associated application.","doi":"10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057893","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034697/6056741/06057893.pdf","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1156","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radical basis function neural network-based NOx soft sensor technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6057893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Radical basis function neural network-based NOx soft sensor technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12376321","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6057893/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radical basis function neural network-based NOx soft sensor technique","confLoc":"Yichang, China","sourcePdf":"CE77697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042982S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034697","isNumber":"6056741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034697","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6056741","articleId":"6057893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6057895,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Room 301, Department of Information Engineering, Hefei Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"38006148700"},{"name":"Huanbing Liu","affiliation":["Room 301, Department of Information Engineering, Hefei Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Huanbing","lastName":"Liu","id":"38025023000"},{"name":"Hui Jiang","affiliation":["Room 301, Department of Information Engineering, Hefei Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38001139500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8162-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8164-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6057895","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6057895","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Turbo codes","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","matrix algebra","multimedia communication","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["irregular repeat accumulate code","flexible code length","IRA code","base check matrix","quasicyclic method","length-4 short circles","link-level performance","LDPC code","IEEE802.16e standard","multimedia communication system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) Code","Irregular Repeat Accumulate (IRA) code","quasi-cyclic (QC) code"]}],"abstract":"Based on the good degree distribution of a kind of irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) code, the base check matrix is designed according to quasi-cyclic method, and the length-4 short circles are eliminated.

Due to the Shamir's and Lagrange algorithms consume a lot of time during the processing of the secret image sharing.

For PSO algorithm, it is fast for convergence, especially at the initial stage, simple for the computing, and is easy to implement. Compared with the genetic algorithms, it does have not the complex operations of hybrid codecs, mutation, so it is a good optimization algorithm. However, PSO algorithm also has some shortcomings it is more and more slow for convergence rate at the late evolution of the algorithm. In this paper, a new BP Neural Network based on improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed. The convergence speed of this algorithm and the capacity of searching global extremum is increased through adjusting the adaptive capacity of learning factor. The simulation results illustrate that the improved PSO is superior to the standard BP algorithm and particle swarm optimization.","doi":"10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057958","startPage":"2626","endPage":"2629","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056741","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034697/6056741/06057958.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of BP Neural Network based on improved PSO in BF temperature forecast","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6057958/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The application of BP Neural Network based on improved PSO in BF temperature forecast","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6057958/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12342045","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of BP Neural Network based on improved PSO in BF temperature forecast","confLoc":"Yichang","sourcePdf":"CE83483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034876S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034697","isNumber":"6056741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034697","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6056741","articleId":"6057958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6058031,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Taghian","affiliation":["Microwave/MMW and Wireless Communications research Laboratory Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Taghian","id":"38016848500"},{"name":"Abdolali Abdipour","affiliation":["Microwave/MMW and Wireless Communications research Laboratory Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdolali","lastName":"Abdipour","id":"37266515300"},{"name":"Abbas Mohammadi","affiliation":["Microwave/MMW and Wireless Communications research Laboratory Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37265914700"},{"name":"Parisa Momen Roodaki","affiliation":["Microwave/MMW and Wireless Communications research Laboratory Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Parisa Momen","lastName":"Roodaki","id":"38016849200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8162-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8164-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6058031","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"abstract":"This paper presents the design and nonlinear analysis of a mm-wave wideband Doherty power amplifier at 22 to 29GHz with 7 GHz bandwidth, the design is done using 0.15\u03bcm GaAs PHEMT transistor to support a variety of mm-wave applications including point to point digital radio, LMDS/LMCS, ka-band satellite spacecraft and ISM applications.

The sensor is installed on a mobile robot whose mission is the detection of anomalous regions in metal pipelines. Given the presence of noise that characterizes the data series, anomaly signals could be masked by noise and therefore difficult to identify in some instances. In order to enhance signal peaks that potentially identify anomalies we consider an entropy filter built on a-posteriori probability density functions associated with data series.

Specifically, the innate reconfigurability of memristors can be exploited for applications ranging from multilevel memory, programmable logic, and neuromorphic computing, to name a few. In this work, memristors are explored for their potential use in dense programmable logic circuits. While much of the work is focused on Boolean logic, nontraditional styles including threshold logic and neuromorhpic computing are also considered. In addition to an analysis of the circuits themselves, computer-aided design (CAD) flows are presented which have been used to map digital logic functionality to dense complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-memristive logic arrays. As exemplified through the circuits described here memristor-based digital logic holds great potential for high-density and energy-efficient computing.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2167489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2167489","startPage":"2033","endPage":"2049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6198299/06058571.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Memristive Systems in the Construction of Digital Logic Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Memristive Systems in the Construction of Digital Logic Circuits","volume":"100","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12713339","publicationDate":"June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6058571/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Memristive Systems in the Construction of Digital Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"jproc-rose-2167489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130621S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6198299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6198299","articleId":"6058571","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6058572,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Kudlinski","affiliation":["Laboratoire PhLAM-IRCICA, Universit\u00e9 Lille 1, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/5644694/6058572/6058572-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandre Kudlinski received the Ph.D. degree in photonics from the University of Science and Technology, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France, in 2005.","He was with the Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials, University of Bath, Bath, U.K., from 2005 to 2006, where he was on photonic crystal fibers.

Compared with SBT, STA shows a better compromise among mechanical stability, time constant, and sensitivity. Because of the small floating structure design, the STA detector only shows a one-fourth deflection as the SBT detector.

The method is designed to generate thin mask cuts to balance the residues. Network flow ideas are taken to build the strategy of mask cut generation. The predecessor index is recorded for every pixel during searching, and the path from the current residue to its last residue ancestor is traced by the predecessor index information. This path is taken as an optimal path from residue to residue. All the pixels on these paths compose the final mask cuts. The proposed method successfully prevents most of the unnecessary pixels from going into the mask cuts. Comparing with the original mask cut method, experimental results show that the proposed method generates thinner and more accurate mask cuts than that generated by the original method. A significant improvement on the unwrapping result is achieved by the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6163264/06058581.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2168940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2168940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mask Cut Optimization in Two-Dimensional Phase Unwrapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Indexes","Optimized production technology","Remote sensing","System-on-a-chip","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved mask cut method","2D phase unwrapping","network flow ideas","mask cut generation","residue ancestor","predecessor index information","optimal path","branch cut","mask cut optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Branch cut","cutline","interferometry","mask cut","network flow","phase unwrapping","quality map"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mask Cut Optimization in Two-Dimensional Phase Unwrapping","volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6058581/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12575009","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mask Cut Optimization in Two-Dimensional Phase Unwrapping","sourcePdf":"lgrs-gao-2168940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071286S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6163264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6163264","articleId":"6058581","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6058583,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is based on the conventional estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) by modeling the imperfections of the ULAs as gain and phase uncertainties. For a fully calibrated array, it reduces to the conventional ESPRIT algorithm. Moreover, the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs), unknown gains, and phases of the uncalibrated sensors can be estimated in closed form without performing a spectral search.

Simulation results show that the root mean squared error (RMSE) performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the conventional methods when the number of uncalibrated sensors is large.

One of the challenges of PAF systems is the design of beamformers that provide sufficient sensitivity and known, stable beam pattern structure. High sensitivity has been achieved with the maximum sensitivity beamformer without regard to beam pattern shape. Deterministic beamformers provide the desired pattern shape control, but suffer from a significant reduction in sensitivity. We present a hybrid beamforming method, which balances the tradeoff between high sensitivity and precise beam pattern shape control. A comparison of each of these beamforming methods, using measured data, confirms the advantage of the hybrid approach. The pattern distortions introduced by modeled beamformers can be mitigated with a transformation step, but ultimately it is shown that PAF beamformer design is best done using measured calibrators. A PAF calibration vector quality metric based on minimum description length is also introduced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamformer Design Methods for Radio Astronomical Phased Array Feeds","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142637/06058599.pdf","startPage":"903","endPage":"914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Beamformer Design Methods for Radio Astronomical Phased Array Feeds","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6058599/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamformer Design Methods for Radio Astronomical Phased Array Feeds","sourcePdf":"tap-elmer-2173143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138187S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6142637","articleId":"6058599","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6058603,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Joubert","affiliation":["Centre for Electromagnetism, Department of Electrical,  Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142637/6058603/6058603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Johan Joubert (M'86\u2013SM'05) received the B.Eng., M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, in 1983, 1987, and 1991 respectively.","From 1984 to 1988 he was employed as a Research Engineer at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria.

The slot antenna radiates above a closely spaced artificial magnetic conducting (AMC) reflector consisting of an array of rectangular patches, a substrate and an electric ground plane. The electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) performance of the cavity structure between the upper conducting surface in which the slot is etched, and the ground plane at the bottom of the reflector, is investigated using an equivalent waveguide feed in the place of a half-wavelength section of the slot antenna.

To overcome inherent narrow radiation bandwidth of FPC-type antennas while keeping relatively high gain, we introduced a new superstrate structure composed of square patches and loops, which satisfies an FPC resonance condition at a target frequency region. To do that, we optimized the superstrate geometry with the help of a real-value coding hybrid genetic algorithm (RHGA). The optimized superstrate is very thin, and therefore, it can be fabricated with a single dielectric substrate, which is a fairly strong point in practical applications. Moreover, we enclosed four openings of the antenna in lateral directions to increase antenna gain with a limited aperture area. Therefore, a modified prediction method of an FPC resonance is used, which reduced the effort of complicated three-dimensional antenna optimization. Consequently, our antenna is able to operate in a wide band-width with a relatively high realized gain. Furthermore, good agreement between measured results and prediction ones confirms the validity of our design approach.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173108","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142637","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142637/06058606.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mobile Communication Base Station Antenna Using a Genetic Algorithm Based Fabry-P\u00e9rot Resonance Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058606/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Mobile Communication Base Station Antenna Using a Genetic Algorithm Based Fabry-P\u00e9rot Resonance Optimization","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6058606/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12509047","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mobile Communication Base Station Antenna Using a Genetic Algorithm Based Fabry-P\u00e9rot Resonance Optimization","sourcePdf":"tap-kim-2173108-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054484S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6142637","articleId":"6058606","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":6058607,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142637/6058607/6058607-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Zhang was born in China in 1984.

For inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imagery, the scattering field of the target is usually composed of only a limited number of strong scattering centers, representing strong spatial sparsity. This paper derives a new autofocus algorithm to exploit the sparse apertures (SAs) data for ISAR imagery. A sparsity-driven optimization based on Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) is developed. In addition, we also propose an approach to determine the sparsity coefficient in the optimization by using constant-false-alarm-rate (CFAR) detection. Solving the sparsity-driven optimization with a modified Quasi-Newton algorithm, the phase error is corrected by combining a two-step phase correction approach, and well-focused image with effective noise suppression is obtained from SA data. Real data experiments show the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142637/06058607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142637","startPage":"997","endPage":"1008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging by Exploiting Sparse Apertures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging by Exploiting Sparse Apertures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058607/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509048","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6058607/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging by Exploiting Sparse Apertures","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2173130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111889S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6142637","articleId":"6058607","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6058610,"authors":[{"name":"Shoaib Anwar Muhammad","affiliation":["IETR UMR CNRS, University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142637/6058610/6058610-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shoaib Anwar Muhammad received the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2005, the Master's degree in telecommunications, RF, and microelectronics from Universit\u00e9 de Nice, Sophia Antipolis, France, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing and telecommunications from the IETR, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes1, Rennes, France, in 2010.","Currently, he is working as a Post-doc Fellow with the IETR.

A systematic study on various design methods of single-feed multi-beam reflectarray antennas is presented in this communication. Two direct design methods for multi-beam reflectarrays, geometrical method and superposition method, are investigated first. It is demonstrated that although both methods could generate a multi-beam radiation pattern, neither approach provides satisfactory performance, mainly due to high side-lobe levels and gain loss in these designs. The alternating projection method is then implemented to optimize the phase distribution on the reflectarray surface for multi-beam performance. Mask definition and convergence condition of the optimization are studied for multi-beam reflectarray designs. Finally a Ka-band reflectarray prototype is fabricated and tested which shows a good quad-beam performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142637/06058612.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Experiment of a Single-Feed Quad-Beam Reflectarray Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","Reflector antennas","Apertures","Arrays","Feeds","Optimization","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","microwave antenna arrays","reflectarray antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-feed quad-beam reflectarray antenna","cost-effective high-gain antenna","multiple simultaneous beams generation","multi-beam reflectarrays","geometrical method","superposition method","multi-beam radiation pattern","Ka-band reflectarray prototype"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating projection method","intersection approach","multi-beam","optimization","reflectarray"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and Experiment of a Single-Feed Quad-Beam Reflectarray Antenna","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6058612/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509053","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Experiment of a Single-Feed Quad-Beam Reflectarray Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-nayeri-2173126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058895S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6142637","articleId":"6058612","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6058614,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Mei Pan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves and Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142637/6058614/6058614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Mei Pan (M'11) was born in Huangshan, Anhui Province, China, in 1982.

This neural network is trained to learn the relationship between the statement coverage information of a test case and its corresponding execution result, success or failure. The trained network is then given as input a set of virtual test cases, each covering a single statement. The output of the network, for each virtual test case, is considered to be the suspiciousness of the corresponding covered statement. A statement with a higher suspiciousness has a higher likelihood of containing a bug, and thus statements can be ranked in descending order of their suspiciousness. The ranking can then be examined one by one, starting from the top, until a bug is located. Case studies on 15 different programs were conducted, and the results clearly show that our proposed technique is more effective than several other popular, state of the art fault localization techniques. Further studies investigate the robustness of the proposed technique, and illustrate how it can easily be applied to programs with multiple bugs as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12571152","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6058639/","publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Effective Software Fault Localization Using an RBF Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Software Fault Localization Using an RBF Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tr-wong-2172031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155779S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"6159254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6159254","articleId":"6058639","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6058649,"authors":[{"name":"Chowarit Mitsantisuk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6220909/6058649/6058649-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chowarit Mitsantisuk (S'07\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the D.Eng degree in energy and environmental science from the Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently with the Nagaoka University of Technology.

In the ideal bilateral control of the haptic system, the force and position control should achieve with the same actions of force and motion movements. An external force should be sensed quickly after contact with an unknown environment. This paper presents formulation and application of a Kalman filtering technique for control of master-slave robots contacting environment in a bilateral control. The different types of motion sensors are mounted on each robot to provide the position and acceleration data in the horizontal dimension. A Kalman-filter-based state observer and a Kalman-filter-based disturbance observer have been designed to estimate action/reaction forces. This paper also deals with the construction of bilateral control with the use of data provided by the different types of motion sensors. Compared to the other conventional disturbance observer or state observer, the bilateral control system based on the proposed method offers the advantages of wider bandwidth, faster response, and free from sensor noise. Thus, it is possible to provide high transparency and good perception of the environmental stiffness. The experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2173092","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6220909/06058649.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6220909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2173092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"4383","endPage":"4393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Action/Reaction Forces for the Bilateral Control Using Kalman Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Action/Reaction Forces for the Bilateral Control Using Kalman Filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058649/","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6058649/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12804821","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Action/Reaction Forces for the Bilateral Control Using Kalman Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-mitsantisuk-2173092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063814S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6220909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6220909","articleId":"6058649","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6058652,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Kafai","affiliation":["Center for Research in Intelligent Systems, Computer Science Department, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6133473/6058652/6058652-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehran Kafai (S'11) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from Bahonar University, Kerman, Iran, in 2002, the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in computer science from the San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA, in 2009.

While numerous approaches have been introduced for this purpose, no specific study has been conducted to provide a robust and complete video-based vehicle classification system based on the rear-side view where the camera's field of view is directly behind the vehicle. In this paper, we present a stochastic multiclass vehicle classification system which classifies a vehicle (given its direct rear-side view) into one of four classes: sedan, pickup truck, SUV/minivan, and unknown. A feature set of tail light and vehicle dimensions is extracted which feeds a feature selection algorithm to define a low-dimensional feature vector. The feature vector is then processed by a hybrid dynamic Bayesian network to classify each vehicle. Results are shown on a database of 169 videos for four classes.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2173203","startPage":"100","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2173203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6133473/06058652.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Vehicle Classification in Video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058652/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Vehicle Classification in Video","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6058652/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12486964","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Vehicle Classification in Video","sourcePdf":"tii-kafai-2173203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101405S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6133473","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6133473","articleId":"6058652","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6058654,"authors":[{"name":"Laura B.

For these modulators, high-voltage and high-current semiconductor switches are required in order to achieve a high pulsed power. Therefore, often, high-power IGBT modules or IGCT devices are used. Since these devices are based on bipolar technology, the switching speed is limited, and the switching losses are higher. In contrast to bipolar devices, unipolar ones (e.g., SiC JFETs) basically offer a better switching performance. Moreover, these devices enable high blocking voltages in the case where wide-band-gap materials, for example, SiC, are used. At the moment, SiC JFET devices with a blocking voltage of 1.2 kV per JFET are available.

The camera borrows from modulated scattering techniques to improve isolation among the array elements. The camera was designed to measure vector electric field distribution, be compact, portable, battery operated, possess high dynamic range, and be capable of producing real-time images at video frame-rate. This imaging system utilizes PIN diode-loaded resonant elliptical slot antennas as its array elements integrated in a simple and relatively low-loss waveguide network thus reducing the complexity, cost and size of the array. The sensitivity and dynamic range of this system is improved by utilizing a custom-designed heterodyne receiver and matched filter for demodulation. The performance of the multiplexing scheme, noise-floor and dynamic range of the receivers are presented as well. Sources of errors such as mutual-coupling and array response dispersion are also investigated. Finally, utilizing this imaging system for various applications such as 2-D electric field mapping, and nondestructive testing is demonstrated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142637/06058691.pdf","startPage":"1114","endPage":"1125","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portable Real-Time Microwave Camera at 24 GHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Portable Real-Time Microwave Camera at 24 GHz","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6058691/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509070","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Portable Real-Time Microwave Camera at 24 GHz","sourcePdf":"tap-ghasr-2173145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070979S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6142637","articleId":"6058691","onlineDate":"21 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6058703,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Manteghi","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Manteghi","id":"37276898400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6058703","dbTime":"43 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Time frequency analysis","Arrays","Object recognition","Antenna arrays","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency identification","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time-frequency target identification technique","chipless RFID applications","singularity expansion method","late time scattered signal","damped sinusoidal","complex conjugate natural frequencies","matrix pencil method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio Frequency Identification RFID","Singularity ExpantionMethod","Space-Time-Frequency Method","Short-Time FourierTransformation"]}],"abstract":"Based on the Singularity Expansion Method (SEM) the late time scattered signal from an object consists of a summation of damped sinusoidals. Each damped sinusoidal represents a pair of complex conjugate natural frequencies (poles) which are tied to the scatterer's structure.

Multiple objects break the matrix pencil method due to existence of different groups of poles and residues with different time windows in the same received signal. The technique presented in this paper attempts to separate poles based on their times and directions of arrival.

We quantify intrawafer and interwafer variation of the position and relative spacing of resonance wavelengths for the microring arrays and confirm prior predictions that the absolute resonance positions of such devices cannot be controlled across wafers or even across reticles within a wafer. However, we show that the free spectral range (FSR) of the microrings can be controlled to within 0.66 nm (83 GHz) across wafers and lots, as can the wavelength spacing between closely spaced microrings. To exploit these findings for low-power optical interconnects, we suggest and demonstrate a synthetic resonant comb with FSR \u2248 N \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">*</sub>\n \u03b4\u03bb, wherein resonance wavelengths are spaced equally across the FSR in order to minimize postfabrication tuning. The experimental CMOS 1 \u00d7 8 microring array requires an average tuning of less than 1.2 nm/channel to align to a 200-GHz wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) grid.

This indicates that it is possible, with high statistical confidence, to use high-volume CMOS manufacturing to reduce the tuning range and tuning energy requirements of silicon microrings and, hence, enhance their ability to be used in high-density, energy-efficient computing system applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058715/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","volume":"3","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13032763","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6058715/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting CMOS Manufacturing to Reduce Tuning Requirements for Resonant Optical Devices","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Exploiting CMOS Manufacturing to Reduce Tuning Requirements for Resonant Optical Devices","sourcePdf":"jphot-krishnamoorthy-2140367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096512S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"5764299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5764299","articleId":"6058715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6058747,"authors":[{"name":"Charna R.

However, most traditional data-driven forecasting methods are off-line which would be seriously limited in many PHM systems that need on-line predicting and real-time processing. Furthermore, even in some on-line prediction methods such as Online SVR, there are conflicts and trade-offs between prognostics efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, in different PHM applications, prognostics algorithms should be on-line, flexible and adaptive to balance the prediction efficiency and accuracy. An on-line adaptive data-driven prognostics strategy is proposed with five different improved on-line prediction algorithms based on Online SVR. These five algorithms are improved with kernel combination and sample reduction to realize higher precision and efficiency. These algorithms can achieve more accurate results by data pre-processing, moreover, faster operation speed and different computational complexity can be achieved by improving training process with on-line data reduction. With these different improved Online SVR approaches, varies of demands with different precision and efficiency could be fulfilled by an adaptive prediction strategy. To evaluate the proposed prognostics strategy, we have executed simulation experiments with Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. In addition, the prediction strategies are also tested and evaluated by traffic mobile communication data from China Mobile Communications Corporation Heilongjiang Co., Ltd. Experiments and test results prove its effectiveness and confirm that the algorithms can be effectively applied to the on-line status prediction with excellent performance in both precision and efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTEST.2011.6058755","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045357/6058721/06058755.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"173","doi":"10.1109/AUTEST.2011.6058755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line adaptive data-driven fault prognostics of complex systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"On-line adaptive data-driven fault prognostics of complex systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6058755/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317663","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058755/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line adaptive data-driven fault prognostics of complex systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1569445649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13452S","chronDate":"12-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045357","isNumber":"6058721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6058721","articleId":"6058755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6058760,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeev Ghimire","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rajeev Ghimire received the B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal in 2005 and M.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona in 2010.

By means of numerical simulations, we prove that this approach enables to design low-complexity, yet power-efficient receivers for realistic IR-UWB scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058808","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed-sensing (decision-feedback) differential detection in impulse-radio ultra-wideband systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed-sensing (decision-feedback) differential detection in impulse-radio ultra-wideband systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058808/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317466","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6058808/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed-sensing (decision-feedback) differential detection in impulse-radio ultra-wideband systems","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p121schenk.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068583S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6058810,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Mohtashami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Mohtashami","id":"37403679900"},{"name":"Amir Ahmad Shishegar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Ahmad","lastName":"Shishegar","id":"37298373600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1764-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1763-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1762-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6058810","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"abstract":"Site-specific ultrawideband propagation modeling involves dealing with frequency variations of the propagation mechanisms and antenna patterns in the ray tracing program. Typically, electromagnetic field calculations have to be performed in a lot of frequencies to accurately construct the frequency response of the channel at a receiving point. This imposes a heavy computational burden on ray tracing specially in calculating the coverage map or finding the statistics of channel parameters where the number of receiving locations is large. In this paper, the computational complexity of ray tracing in ultrawideband propagation modeling is reduced by using cubic B-spline interpolation. The frequency response of the channel at each receiving point is obtained by calculating the electromagnetic fields at a limited number of frequencies and then interpolating the results using cubic B-splines. A speedup of about four times in simulating a typical residential environment is achieved. Besides, the accuracy of the results is maintained due to excellent characteristics of the cubic B-spline interpolation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058810.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using cubic B-spline interpolation for efficient ray-tracing-based ultrawideband propagation modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Spline","Ultra wideband technology","Ray tracing","Antennas and propagation","Frequency response","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","interpolation","ray tracing","splines (mathematics)","ultra wideband antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cubic B-spline interpolation","site-specific ultrawideband propagation modeling","frequency variations","propagation mechanism","antenna patterns","ray tracing program","electromagnetic field calculation","frequency response","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Using cubic B-spline interpolation for efficient ray-tracing-based ultrawideband propagation modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6058810/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317468","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using cubic B-spline interpolation for efficient ray-tracing-based ultrawideband propagation modeling","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p12mohtashami.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070161S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6058820,"authors":[{"name":"Chung Le","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"lastName":"Chung Le","id":"38005320500"},{"name":"Emil Dimitrov","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37679125300"},{"name":"Sanam Moghaddamnia","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Sanam","lastName":"Moghaddamnia","id":"37946814200"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1764-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1763-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1762-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6058820","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Minimization","Transmitters","Bit error rate","MIMO","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","radio links","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE-based interference alignment","multiplexing gain","K-multiuser MIMO interference channel","channel state information","transmission link","closed-form solution","precoding filter","sum-rate performance","SNR regime","MB-OFDM based multiuser MIMO UWB system","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference Alignment","MMSE","Multiuser MIMO MB-OFDM","UWB"]}],"abstract":"To achieve the full multiplexing gains or the degrees of freedom of the K-multiuser MIMO interference channel, the interference alignment technique has been proposed and investigated. The main idea of interference alignment is to design the pre-coder at each transmitter, so that each receiver can align all interference from undesired transmitters in interference subspaces by exploiting knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of all transmission links. Currently, a closed-form solution for the pre-coding filters exists only for the case of up to three users and provides poor sum-rate performance compared to iterative algorithms. Furthermore, all available algorithms for interference alignment were investigated only for the case, where each transmitter sends only one data stream. In this paper, the MMSE-based interference alignment is exploited to improve the BER and sum-rate performance of the system especially in the low SNR regime. This paper focuses on a multiuser MIMO UWB system based on MB-OFDM with arbitrary number of independent data streams per user. The simulation results confirm that the MMSE-based interference alignment provides sum-rate and BER superior to Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) at marginal performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058820","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058820.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance investigation of MMSE-based interference alignment for multiuser MIMO UWB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058820/","displayDocTitle":"Performance investigation of MMSE-based interference alignment for multiuser MIMO UWB","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317478","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6058820/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance investigation of MMSE-based interference alignment for multiuser MIMO UWB","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p170le.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044844S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6058824,"authors":[{"name":"Joakim \u00d6sth","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"\u00d6sth","id":"37396651900"},{"name":"Owais","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"lastName":"Owais","id":"37396652000"},{"name":"Magnus Karlsson","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Karlsson","id":"37267658000"},{"name":"Adriana Serban","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Adriana","lastName":"Serban","id":"37282181300"},{"name":"Shaofang Gong","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Shaofang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37269431900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1764-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1763-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1762-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6058824","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Sensitivity","Baseband","Bit error rate","Schottky diodes","Dynamic range","Correlators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","demodulation","demodulators","filters","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","six-port receivers","simplified interface","amplifier","filter","six-port demodulator prototypes","UWB band","odd-order harmonic suppression","quadrature amplitude modulation signal","error vector magnitude","bit error rate","sensitivity","dynamic range"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["six-port receiver","demodulator","six-port demodulator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058824","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058824.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of six-port receivers with simplified interface to amplifier and filter","abstract":"The performance of two different six-port demodulator prototypes for the UWB band 6 to 8.5 GHz are presented.

In IEEE 802.15.3c standard, a codebook based analog beamforming mechanism is adopted for its simplicity and feasibility. However, this simple beam sweep mechanism may not work properly in the presence of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) when dense spatial reuse is required. In this paper, an enhanced beamforming technique is proposed with mixed analog and digital beamforming structure for 60GHz Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. Beam sweep mechanism with such as codebook based phased antenna array can be applied to analog beamforming for its hardware simplicity. On the other hand, more than one RF chains can be introduced to enable adaptive digital beamforming for improved performance and robustness. A Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) based switched beam or beamforming codeword selection algorithm is proposed for this mixed analog/digital beamforming structure to achieve enhanced interference mitigation and spatial reuse capability in the presence of CCI.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058850.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced beamforming for 60GHz OFDM system with co-channel interference mitigation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Phased arrays","Radio frequency","Arrays","OFDM","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","cochannel interference","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","cochannel interference mitigation","wireless system","millimeter-wave region","high propagation path loss","IEEE 802.15.3 standard","codebook based analog beamforming mechanism","beam sweep mechanism","dense spatial reuse","enhanced beamforming technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","phased antenna array","RF chains","adaptive digital beamforming","minimum mean square error based switched beam","MMSE","mixed analog-digital beamforming structure","beamforming codeword selection algorithm","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced beamforming for 60GHz OFDM system with co-channel interference mitigation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6058850/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317508","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced beamforming for 60GHz OFDM system with co-channel interference mitigation","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p29lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037303S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6058864,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Barbieri","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Barbieri","id":"37411005600"},{"name":"Fabrizio Pancaldi","affiliation":["Department of Science and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Pancaldi","id":"37279016900"},{"name":"Giorgio M.

Due to this sparse structure, there has been a significant amount of interest in applying the compressive sensing (CS) theory to UWB channel estimation. There are various implementations of the CS theory for the UWB channel estimation based on the assumption that the UWB channels are sparse. However, the sparsity of a UWB channel mainly depends on the channel environment. Motivated by this, in this study we investigate the effect of UWB channel environments on the CS based UWB channel estimation. Particularly, we consider the standardized IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channel models and study the channel estimation performance from a practical implementation point of view. The study shows that while UWB channel models for residential environments (e.g., CM1 and CM2) exhibit a sparse structure yielding a reasonable channel estimation performance, channel models for industrial environments (e.g., CM8) may not be treated as having a sparse structure due to multipaths arriving densely. The results of this study are important as it determines the suitability of different channel models to be used with the CS theory.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058867","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058867.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of channel models on compressed sensing based UWB channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058867/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of channel models on compressed sensing based UWB channel estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317525","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6058867/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of channel models on compressed sensing based UWB channel estimation","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p375basaran.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048844S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6058875,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Ch\u00f3liz","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Ch\u00f3liz","id":"37298164900"},{"name":"\u00c1ngela Hern\u00e1ndez-Solana","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"\u00c1ngela","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez-Solana","id":"38185150100"},{"name":"Ana Sierra","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Sierra","id":"37542787200"},{"name":"Pierre Cluzeaud","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Cluzeaud","id":"37601262700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1764-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1763-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1762-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6058875","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"abstract":"The level of interference caused by Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems in current radio services has been widely studied, both theoretically and with measurement campaigns, although most of them focus on pulse-based UWB systems.

As restrictive spectrum masks have been imposed to UWB, no degradation is detected on those systems except for WiMAX as it operates in the same frequency band. On the other hand, MB-OFDM may be disturbed even by systems operating in a different frequency band due to spurious out-of-band emissions. The coexistence between MB-OFDM and Impulse Radio (IR) UWB systems is also addressed and experimental results are presented showing that IR UWB may interfere with MB-OFDM UWB systems causing a degradation on Packet Error Rate, which is limited due to the low activity factor of IR UWB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058875.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"414","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence of MB-OFDM UWB with Impulse Radio UWB and other radio systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Degradation","WiMAX","Zigbee","Receivers","Portable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MB-OFDM UWB system","impulse radio UWB system","radio services","pulse-based UWB systems","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultrawideband systems","impulse radio ultrawideband systems","UMTS","WiMax","LTE","WiFi","Bluetooth","ZigBee","restrictive spectrum masks","IR UWB systems","packet error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","coexistence","MB-OFDM","Impulse radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coexistence of MB-OFDM UWB with Impulse Radio UWB and other radio systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6058875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317533","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistence of MB-OFDM UWB with Impulse Radio UWB and other radio systems","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p410choliz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053065S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6058884,"authors":[{"name":"Tianheng Wang","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tianheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38024061400"},{"name":"Yuan Shen","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37400482800"},{"name":"Santiago Mazuelas","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Mazuelas","id":"37303763000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1764-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1763-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1762-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6058884","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","OFDM","Accuracy","Multipath channels","Approximation methods","Radio frequency","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM ranging accuracy","multipath channels","wireless ranging","transmission technique","propagation channel","high-accuracy ranging algorithms","multipath propagation environments","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM systems","Fisher information analysis","equivalent Fisher information","channel parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ranging","orthogonal frequency-division multi-plexing (OFDM)","multipath channel","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB)","equivalent Fisher information (EFI)"]}],"abstract":"The performance of wireless ranging depends on both the transmission technique and the propagation channel.

Results of extensive tests and measurements, and experience acquired from the design and operation of commercial products, all concurred to depict UWB as a very promising technology in many context and applications, thanks to its intrinsic characteristics. Now, wireless communications are colonizing higher frequencies and the UWB paradigm is a valid candidate for a transmission technology even there. Since many attractive features of UWB are related to its propagation characteristics, this paper provides a synopsis of the behavior of UWB signals on channels at different frequencies, from very low frequencies, below 1 GHz, through the 3.1-10.6 GHz band, and up to the 60 GHz. Finally, a generalized expression is proposed for the channel impulse response over this huge frequency span, accounting for all phenomena and behaviors observed through a variety of channel measurement campaigns at different frequencies and in different environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB Moves up to mmWaves: A channel modeling perspective","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058900","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058900.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"UWB Moves up to mmWaves: A channel modeling perspective","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6058900/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317558","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB Moves up to mmWaves: A channel modeling perspective","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p521cassioli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070557S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6058910,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Meissner","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Meissner","id":"37595713200"},{"name":"Daniel Arnitz","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Arnitz","id":"37403156600"},{"name":"Thomas Gigl","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gigl","id":"37403153600"},{"name":"Klaus Witrisal","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Witrisal","id":"37264939700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1764-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1763-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1762-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6058910","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Trajectory","Delay","Energy capture","Base stations","Frequency measurement","Ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor communication","multipath channels","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor UWB channel measurement campaign","multipath-aided indoor localization","relevant reflections","scatterers","virtual signal sources","ray-launching technique","single base station","multipath cancellation method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058910","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058910","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","abstract":"We present a detailed analysis of an indoor UWB channel measurement campaign. The focus is on the modeling of the deterministic part of the multipath channel using a-priori known relevant reflections and scatterers, found from an available floor plan. Our approach uses virtual signal sources, whose locations and visibilities can be calculated using simple ray-launching techniques. The channel analysis steps exploit these results, using an effective multipath cancellation method that introduces virtually no artifacts. We show that the corresponding multipath-components can explain up to 90% of the UWB channel impulse responses in terms of energy capture. This is important for multipath-aided indoor localization, which provides robust position fixes using a single base station only.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","startPage":"565","endPage":"569","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058910.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of an indoor UWB channel for multipath-aided localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6058910/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of an indoor UWB channel for multipath-aided localization","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317568","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of an indoor UWB channel for multipath-aided localization","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"p565meissner.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042523S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045285","isNumber":"6058800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045285","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6058800","articleId":"6058910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6058914,"authors":[{"name":"Farid Bautista","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Bautista","id":"37705164100"},{"name":"Dominique Morche","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Morche","id":"37346781800"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Dehmas","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Dehmas","id":"37392174900"},{"name":"Gilles Masson","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Masson","id":"37544918800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1764-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1763-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1762-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6058914","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Receivers","Estimation","Array signal processing","Accuracy","Arrays","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","mean square error methods","radio receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power beamforming RF architecture","AOA technique","UWB beamforming RF architecture","ranging accuracy","angle of arrival","double quadrature receiver","ranging simulation","pulse repetition frequency","root mean square error","channel noise","RF impairment","frequency 1.5 MHz","frequency 15.6 MHz"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power beamforming RF architecture enabling fine ranging and AOA techniques","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058800","endPage":"589","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045285/6058800/06058914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058914","startPage":"585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058914","abstract":"This work presents the advantages and capabilities of the UWB beamforming RF architecture introduced in [1].

The results validated the capability of F-ART with one shot fast learning on the effectiveness of this adaptive learning algorithm along with the robustness and fast response that can provide a real-time network anomaly detection.","publicationTitle":"7th International Conference on Networked Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Conference on Networked Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6047356/6058932/06058956.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058932","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-ART in network anomaly detection with feature-reduction dataset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-ART in network anomaly detection with feature-reduction dataset","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058956/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317725","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6058956/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-ART in network anomaly detection with feature-reduction dataset","confLoc":"Gumi, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"22INC2011Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059856S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6047356","isNumber":"6058932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6047356","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6058932","articleId":"6058956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6058962,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00f6rn Altmann","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rn","lastName":"Altmann","id":"37270584900"},{"name":"Matthias Hovestadt","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Hovestadt","id":"37283393900"},{"name":"Odej Kao","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Odej","lastName":"Kao","id":"37283390700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-88678-43-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6058962","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Biological system modeling","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","decision support systems","marketing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business support service platform","open cloud computing markets","revenue streams","business economics","cloud management cockpit","CMC business support model"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing faces two business-related issues. First, the management of clouds requires not only technical skills but also the understanding of the business side of these systems. Traditional distributed systems research did not require this understanding, simply assuming that all components involved are willing to cooperate according to the resource allocation algorithm prescribed. This cooperation assumption is not valid anymore if clouds are commercial. Secondly, the demand of cloud customers can cause demand spikes at any time, raising the questions on how to allocate the limited resources. Consequently, a real-time view of the provider's business with respect to revenue streams and costs becomes essential for cloud providers. Such a system helps them to respond in an economically efficient way. From the user perspective, the understanding of the different offerings of clouds is also becoming none-trivial, requiring a support in selecting the best-fitting cloud service. A solution to these two issues is the use of business economics. The objective of this work is to lay out a concept and design of a business support service platform, which is called Cloud Management Cockpit (CMC), which uses business economics for giving decision support to providers for managing clouds and for using clouds. The applications of the CMC are laid out in three scenarios. They highlight the usefulness of the CMC business support models and demonstrate how CMC enables platform interoperability, service composition, and reduces complexity of clouds.","publicationTitle":"7th International Conference on Networked Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Conference on Networked Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6047356/6058932/06058962.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058932","startPage":"149","endPage":"154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Business support service platform for providers in open cloud computing markets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Business support service platform for providers in open cloud computing markets","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058962/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317730","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6058962/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Business support service platform for providers in open cloud computing markets","confLoc":"Gumi, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"28INC2011Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051503S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6047356","isNumber":"6058932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6047356","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6058932","articleId":"6058962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6058997,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Silvestre-Blanes","affiliation":["ITI, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Alcoy, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Silvestre-Blanes","id":"38277070600"},{"name":"Paulo Pedreiras","affiliation":["IT, University of Aveiro UA, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Pedreiras","id":"37281910000"},{"name":"Ricardo Marau","affiliation":["DEEC / IT, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Marau","id":"37392801600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0018-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0017-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0016-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"6058997","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Quality of service","Streaming media","Real time systems","Heuristic algorithms","Protocols","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth mapping algorithm","distributed media control application","industrial media control application","online QoS management service","bandwidth distribution mechanism","bijective function","multiple solution","bandwidth value","application performance level"]}],"abstract":"Industrial media control applications require on-line QoS management services to dynamically allocate the bandwidth among the entities that compose the distributed application. The bandwidth distribution mechanism assigns bandwidth to each entity based on the QoS requirements and the current state of the network. However, mapping that bandwidth into operational parameters that serve the scheduling model of the network is not straightforward. Due to systems constraints, this is not a bijective function, therefore multiple solutions may mathematically represent the same bandwidth value but lead to different application performance levels. This paper presents two mapping algorithms and analyzes their performance in this context. The obtained results show that the selection of this mapping algorithm is highly relevant for the application performance.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2011.6058997","publicationTitle":"ETFA2011","displayPublicationTitle":"ETFA2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045288/6058966/06058997.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2011.6058997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058966","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth mapping algorithms in distributed media control applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6058997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth mapping algorithms in distributed media control applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6058997/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330003","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6058997/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth mapping algorithms in distributed media control applications","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"Paper1Tr204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090744S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045288","isNumber":"6058966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045288","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6058966","articleId":"6058997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6059011,"authors":[{"name":"Johan \u00c5kerberg","affiliation":["Corporate Research, ABB AB, Vasteras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"\u00c5kerberg","id":"37542952700"},{"name":"Mikael Gidlund","affiliation":["Corporate Research, ABB AS, Billingstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Gidlund","id":"37298285200"},{"name":"Frank Reichenbach","affiliation":["Corporate Research, ABB AB, Vasteras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Reichenbach","id":"37298882300"},{"name":"Mats Bj\u00f6rkman","affiliation":["School of Innovation, Design, and Technology, M\u00e4lardalen University, Vasteras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rkman","id":"37374896300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0018-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0017-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0016-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"6059011","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Wireless communication","Communication system security","Protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Bit error rate","Boilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["certification","error statistics","protocols","radio links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial wireless HART network","PROFIsafe","safety-critical communication","wireless communication","functional safety profile","WirelessHART protocol","round-trip time","bit error rate","certification requirement","safety-critical data","wireless links","channel noise"]}],"abstract":"Contrary to the various theoretic publications on safety-critical communication over wireless, this paper will show the actual performance of safety-critical communication in a real plant with all its environmental influences.

This can become an elaborate task in large PROFINET IO installations and it would therefore be useful to have some tool support to automatically detect and import the actually installed modules in an IO device.

The results of this case study can be used both to improve simulation models of devices and to verify critical situations in real plants.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2011.6059160","publicationTitle":"ETFA2011","displayPublicationTitle":"ETFA2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045288/6058966/06059160.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2011.6059160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large PROFINET IO RT networks for factory automation: A case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059160/","displayDocTitle":"Large PROFINET IO RT networks for factory automation: A case study","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330156","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6059160/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large PROFINET IO RT networks for factory automation: A case study","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"Paper3WIP211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067175S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045288","isNumber":"6058966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045288","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6058966","articleId":"6059160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6059436,"authors":[{"name":"Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6059436/6059436-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar (M'08) received the telecommunications engineering degree from the Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, USA, in 2008.

In order to avoid interference to licensed users, spectrum sensing has emerged as an enabling technology for DSA. The requirements for spectrum sensors are stringent, as licensed user detection must be performed reliably at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Sensing performance can be improved by exploiting signal features not present in the background noise. These approaches result in tradeoffs among performance and robustness to departures from the signal model. We consider second-order signal features and develop detectors exploiting spatial (by using multiple antennas) as well as temporal signal correlation, taking advantage of the fact that the power spectrum of the primary signal at each antenna can be known up to a complex scalar representing the unknown propagation channel. A low-SNR Generalized Likelihood Ratio approach is adopted in order to overcome this uncertainty, resulting in different tests intimately related to familiar diversity combining techniques. The performance of the proposed detectors is analyzed and tested in different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.101211.110665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059436.pdf","startPage":"4345","endPage":"4355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101211.110665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiantenna Spectrum Sensing Exploiting Spectral a priori Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiantenna Spectrum Sensing Exploiting Spectral a priori Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6059436/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425543","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiantenna Spectrum Sensing Exploiting Spectral a priori Information","sourcePdf":"4345-tw1112-vilar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103409S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059436","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6059438,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Mitliagkas","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Crete, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6059438/6059438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Mitliagkas received his Diploma and M.Sc. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Crete, Greece in 2008 and 2010 respectively.

Power control has been extensively studied in this context, including distributed algorithms that are particularly appealing in ad-hoc and cognitive settings. A long-standing issue is that the power control problem may be infeasible, thus requiring appropriate admission control. The power and admission control parts of the problem are tightly coupled, but the joint optimization problem is NP-hard. We begin with a convenient reformulation which enables a disciplined convex approximation approach. This leads to a centralized approximate solution that is numerically shown to outperform the prior art, and even yield close to optimal results in certain cases - at affordable complexity. The issue of imperfect channel state information is also considered. A distributed implementation is then developed, which alternates between distributed approximation and distributed deflation - reaching consensus on a user to drop, when needed. Both phases require only local communication and computation, yielding a relatively lightweight distributed algorithm with the same performance as its centralized counterpart.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6059438/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425545","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power and Admission Control for Ad-Hoc and Cognitive Underlay Networks: Convex Approximation and Distributed Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power and Admission Control for Ad-Hoc and Cognitive Underlay Networks: Convex Approximation and Distributed Implementation","sourcePdf":"4110-tw1112-mitli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092022S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059438","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059439,"authors":[{"name":"Edward C.

Conventional power allocation strategies, which do not consider spectrum sensing information (SSI), may not be optimal in OSA based cognitive radio system because when the SU mis-detects the PU's presence, the interference from the PU will cause a lower data rate or a higher outage probability to the SU. In this paper, power allocation strategies for each frame are designed based on the SSI gathered by the SU during the sensing period of the frame. We consider both cooperative and non-cooperative spectrum sensing scenarios. In non-cooperative spectrum sensing, the SU transmitter (SU-Tx) has its SSI while in cooperative spectrum sensing, the SU-Tx has both its SSI and the SU receiver's (SU-Rx's) SSI. Using the SSIs, power allocation strategies are designed to either maximize the average data rate or minimize the outage probability of the SU. The proposed power allocation strategies have to ensure that the PU is sufficiently protected and the SU satisfies its long-term transmit power budget. Optimization of the sensing time is also considered to further enhance the performances of the system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101511.102234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","startPage":"4238","endPage":"4248","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059439.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control in Cognitive Radios under Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6059439/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power Control in Cognitive Radios under Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425546","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control in Cognitive Radios under Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"4238-tw1112-peh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070066S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059439","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059441,"authors":[{"name":"Sezi Bakim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I\u015f\u0131k University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sezi","lastName":"Bakim","id":"38229590900"},{"name":"Onur Kaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I\u015f\u0131k University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Kaya","id":"37271906100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6059441","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":511},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Receivers","Decoding","Fading channels","Resource management","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","cooperative communication","encoding","Markov processes","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative strategies","achievable rates","OFDMA channels","block Markov superposition encoding","cooperative messages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block Markov encoding","diversity","OFDMA","user cooperation"]}],"abstract":"We propose three encoding strategies for a two user cooperative Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system, based on block Markov superposition encoding (BMSE).

Due to spectrum availability and network infrastructure considerations, a macro network may have to share spectrum with overlaid femtocells. In spectrum-sharing macro and femto networks, inter-cell interference caused by different transmission powers of macrocell base stations (MBSs) and femtocell access points (FAPs), in conjunction with potentially densely deployed femtocells, may create dead spots where reliable services cannot be guaranteed to either macro or femto users. In this paper, based on a thorough analysis of downlink (DL) outage probabilities (OPs) of collocated spectrum-sharing orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based macro and femto networks, we devise a decentralized strategy for an FAP to self-regulate its transmission power level and usage of radio resources depending on its distance from the closest MBS. Simulation results show that the derived closed-form lower bounds of DL OPs are tight, and the proposed decentralized femtocell self-regulation strategy is able to guarantee reliable DL services in targeted macro and femto service areas while providing superior spatial reuse, for even a large number of spectrum-sharing femtocells deployed per cell site.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059442.pdf","startPage":"4306","endPage":"4315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.101511.110237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101511.110237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Providing Downlink Services in Collocated Spectrum-Sharing Macro and Femto Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference (signal)","Frequency modulation","Macrocell networks","Downlink","Radio spectrum management","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink service","collocated spectrum sharing","macrocellular network","femtocellular network","intercell interference","macrocell base station","femtocell access point","downlink outage probability","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA","decentralized FAP","transmission power level self-regulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink","femtocell","macrocell","OFDMA","outage probability","spectrum-sharing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"On Providing Downlink Services in Collocated Spectrum-Sharing Macro and Femto Networks","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6059442/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425549","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Providing Downlink Services in Collocated Spectrum-Sharing Macro and Femto Networks","sourcePdf":"4306-tw1112-chu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08321S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059442","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6059443,"authors":[{"name":"Chunsheng Xin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6059443/6059443-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunsheng Xin is currently an Associate Professor in Norfolk State University.

Every SU node selects its operational channel independently. When a node wants to rendezvous with another node, the former estimates the operational channel of the latter. The scheme ensures that such rendezvous has a high probability of success, while operational channels are diversified to reduce co-channel interference and hence increase throughput. We develop a mathematical model to analyze the performance of the scheme.

Many practical systems that differ from ideal schemes have been discussed in the literature. One example is a system that lacks precise channel information at the transmitter. We evaluate analytically the performance of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technique that uses partial channel knowledge. Specifically, we analyze a scheme with M transmit antennas and N receive antennas, employing eigenbeamforming at the transmitter and MRC at the receiver. We assume that only partial channel matrix is known to the transmitter, specifically only P out of N rows of the channel matrix are known. We derive the optimal beamformer for a single stream transmission case and show that it is the singular vector of the known channel submatrix. We show that the diversity order of a transmission scheme where such a precoder is used is MP+N-P and further show that increasing the value of P by one increases the diversity order by M-1. We also derive the array gain for this scheme. All the results are supported by simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425552","htmlLink":"/document/6059445/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Optimal Beamforming with Partial Channel Knowledge","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Optimal Beamforming with Partial Channel Knowledge","sourcePdf":"4035-tw1112-shilo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062136S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059445","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059447,"authors":[{"name":"Norman C.

It is shown that performance results in Nakagami-m fading of AF multihop relaying systems obtained based on this upper bound are not tight for small values of SNR or for larger values of the Nakagami parameter and, depending on certain channel conditions, these bounds may become looser as the number of hops increases. A new approximation to the instantaneous end-to-end received SNR is introduced in the form of a scaled version of the harmonic mean of the individual per-hop SNRs. The scaling factor is determined based on the average link SNRs. Performance results evaluated using the proposed approximation are more accurate than all performance bounds previously reported in the literature, even though they are obtained with the same computational complexity. Numerical results show that the approximate performance results are very close to the exact results especially in small SNR regimes or for larger values of the Nakagami parameter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059447.pdf","startPage":"3985","endPage":"3989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.101811.101133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101811.101133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Precise Approximation for Performance Evaluation of Amplify-and-Forward Multihop Relaying Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Approximation methods","Error probability","Fading channels","Upper bound","Capacity planning","Nakagami distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","communication complexity","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","amplify-and-forward multihop relaying system","signal-to-noise ratio","K-hop amplify-and-forward relaying system","harmonic mean","Nakagami-m fading","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward","ergodic capacity","error probability","multihop relaying","outage probability","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Precise Approximation for Performance Evaluation of Amplify-and-Forward Multihop Relaying Systems","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6059447/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425554","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Precise Approximation for Performance Evaluation of Amplify-and-Forward Multihop Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"3985-tw1112-beau.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073201S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059447","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059450,"authors":[{"name":"Yang-wen Liang","affiliation":["Research In Motion, RIM Cellular Technologies, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6059450/6059450-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang-wen Liang (S'02, M'11) received his B.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, in 2004, and his M.A.Sc and Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

In FF-BF, the relay nodes filter the received signal using finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. For the processing at the transceivers, we investigate two different cases: (1) simple slicing without equalization and (2) linear equalization (LE) or decision-feedback equalization (DFE). For the first case, we optimize FIR FF-BF filters, respectively, for maximization of the minimum transceiver signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) subject to a relay transmit power constraint and for minimization of the total relay transmit power subject to two quality of service (QoS) constraints. We show that both problems can be transformed into a convex second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem, which can be efficiently solved using standard tools. For the second case, we optimize IIR and FIR FF-BF filters for max-min optimization of the SINR, and for transceivers with zero-forcing LE, also for minimization of the sum mean-squared error (MSE) at the equalizer outputs of both transceivers. Leveraging results from FF-BF for one-way relaying, we establish an upper and an achievable lower bound for the max-min problem and an exact solution for the sum MSE problem. Since the gap between the upper and the lower bound for the max-min problem is small, a close-to-optimal solution is obtained. Our simulation results reveal that the performance of FF-BF without equalization at the transceivers crucially depends on the slicer decision delay and transceivers with slicers can closely approach the performance of transceivers with equalizers provided that the FF-BF filters are sufficiently long and a sufficient number of relays is deployed.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.101511.101952","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059450.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101511.101952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"4172","endPage":"4183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Way Filter-and-Forward Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Two-Way Filter-and-Forward Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059450/","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6059450/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425556","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Way Filter-and-Forward Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"4172-tw1112-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073467S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059450","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6059451,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Hau Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Hau","lastName":"Fang","id":"37401406900"},{"name":"Ying-Tso Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Tso","lastName":"Hsu","id":"38231703600"},{"name":"Wen-Hsing Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Hsing","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37533839200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6059451","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1009},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a dynamic fingerprinting combination (DFC) algorithm that improves mobile localization by dynamically weighting the spatial correlation from multiple location fingerprinting systems. This DFC algorithm first extracts the complementary advantages of fingerprinting functions to construct a fusion profile, and then dynamically combines individual outputs based on the fusion profile surrounding the test sample. The proposed algorithm generates more accurate location estimates and reduces the risk of selecting a poorly-performing fingerprinting approach. This study applies DFC to an actual GSM network with realistic measurements. Experimental results show that DFC improves the positioning accuracy of base fingerprinting algorithms, including the Bayesian approach and a neural network model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059451.pdf","startPage":"4018","endPage":"4022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.101211.101957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101211.101957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Fingerprinting Combination for Improved Mobile Localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Bayesian methods","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","mobile computing","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fingerprinting combination","mobile localization","spatial correlation","multiple location fingerprinting systems","Bayesian approach","neural network model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile positioning","location fingerprinting","wireless networks","received signal strength","hybrid system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Fingerprinting Combination for Improved Mobile Localization","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6059451/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425557","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Fingerprinting Combination for Improved Mobile Localization","sourcePdf":"4018-tw1112-fang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044436S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059451","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6059452,"authors":[{"name":"Saman Atapattu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6059452/6059452-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saman Atapattu (S'06) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka in 2003 and the M.

Motivated by this context, we propose a mixture gamma (MG) distribution for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of wireless channels. Not only is it a more accurate model for composite fading, but is also a versatile approximation for any fading SNR. As this distribution consists of N (\u2265 1) component gamma distributions, we show how its parameters can be determined by using probability density function (PDF) or moment generating function (MGF) matching. We demonstrate the accuracy of the MG model by computing the mean square error (MSE) or the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or by comparing the moments. With this model, performance metrics such as the average channel capacity, the outage probability, the symbol error rate (SER), and the detection capability of an energy detector are readily derived.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.111210.102115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059452.pdf","startPage":"4193","endPage":"4203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.111210.102115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixture Gamma Distribution to Model the SNR of Wireless Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Mixture Gamma Distribution to Model the SNR of Wireless Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059452/","publicationDate":"December 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12425558","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6059452/","volume":"10","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixture Gamma Distribution to Model the SNR of Wireless Channels","sourcePdf":"4193-tw1112-atapattu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090007S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059452","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6059453,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Seyfi","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6059453/6059453-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Seyfi (S'06) received his B.Sc and M.Sc both in Electrical Engineering from Shiraz University in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

In our relay selection scheme, only one relay with the best relay-to-destination (R \u2192 D) channel quality is selected among the set of relays that decode the source information correctly. Specifically, the destination terminal first estimates the channel state information (CSI) of all active R \u2192 D links and then sends the index of the best relay to the relay terminals via a delayed feedback link. Due to the time varying nature of the fading channels, selection is performed based on the old version of the channel estimate. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average capacity and average symbol error rate (ASER) are derived. Through asymptotic diversity order analysis, we show that the presence of feedback delay reduces the asymptotic diversity order to one, while the effect of channel estimation errors reduces it to zero. Finally, simulation results are presented to corroborate the analytical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059453.pdf","startPage":"4161","endPage":"4171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.101711.100901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101711.100901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Feedback Delay on the Performance of Cooperative Networks with Relay Selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Channel estimation","Feedback","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","delays","fading channels","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback delay","decode-and-forward cooperative transmission networks","DF","relay-to-destination channel quality","channel state information","CSI","closed-form expressions","outage probability","average symbol error rate","ASER","asymptotic diversity order","channel estimation errors","fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay selection","decode-and-forward","feedback delay","channel estimation error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Feedback Delay on the Performance of Cooperative Networks with Relay Selection","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6059453/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425559","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Feedback Delay on the Performance of Cooperative Networks with Relay Selection","sourcePdf":"4161-tw1112-seyfi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069544S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059453","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059454,"authors":[{"name":"Illsoo Sohn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA","Advanced Communication Technology Research Laboratory, LG Electronics Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6059454/6059454-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Illsoo Sohn (S'03, M'11) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.

The objective is to optimize downlink transmit beamforming at each BS in order to maximize the sum throughput over the entire network. While ideal centralized beamforming requires full channel state information (CSI) sharing among all BSs in the network and huge computational complexity for combinatorial optimization, the proposed graphical model enables distributed beamforming which requires only local CSI sharing between neighboring BSs and efficiently solves the optimization problem in a distributed manner. As distributed solvers for this problem, we derive message-passing algorithms which can be implemented with polynomial-time computational complexity. Furthermore, we make a slight approximation on the objective function to derive a simpler graphical model, providing further complexity saving. Simulation results indicate that the proposed distributed downlink beamforming achieves average cell throughput typically within just 2% of ideal centralized beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.101210.101698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06059454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.101210.101698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","startPage":"4140","endPage":"4149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief Propagation for Distributed Downlink Beamforming in Cooperative MIMO Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Belief Propagation for Distributed Downlink Beamforming in Cooperative MIMO Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425560","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6059454/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief Propagation for Distributed Downlink Beamforming in Cooperative MIMO Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"4140-tw1112-sohn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089825S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6059454","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059457,"authors":[{"name":"Ze Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Li","id":"37537158400"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37349930400"},{"name":"Hao Chi","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Chi","id":"37288397600"},{"name":"Xianmin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianmin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291969100"},{"name":"Jianping Yao","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Yao","id":"37280659900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6059457","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":739},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A photonic approach to generating a phase-coded millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signal with large frequency tunability is proposed and demonstrated.

A polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg grating is then utilized to make the two sidebands orthogonally polarized. By sending the two orthogonally polarized sidebands to a polarization modulator, to which a phase-coding signal is applied, a frequency-quadrupled phase-coded mm-wave signal is generated. The generation of a phase-coded mm-wave signal with tunable frequencies at 40, 42, and 50 GHz is experimentally demonstrated.

Due to the unipolarity of the IM/DD channel, any asymmetric clipping of the bipolar OFDM signal and associated nonlinear distortion will result in an unfavorable dc power and significant performance penalty. Using a detailed analysis of the clipping distortion, we propose a new framework to enable IM/DD optical OFDM transmission, where certain subchannels are reserved to produce a negative peak cancellation (NPC) signal via a frequency-domain digital filter. This NPC signal guarantees a unipolar OFDM signal, hence eliminating any additional biasing and/or clipping. It also produces no in-band or out-of-and distortions and requires no transmission of any side information. Beneficial tradeoffs are identified that enable an efficient use of both the available power and spectrum.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2173297","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

Three such surfaces, each with printed dipoles on both sides, have been designed to obtain different positive reflection phase gradients and reflection magnitude levels in the operating frequency bands. These surfaces, and the EBG resonator antennas formed from them, are analyzed theoretically and experimentally to highlight the design compromises involved and to reveal the relationships between the antenna peak gain, gain bandwidth, the reflection profile (i.e., positive phase gradient and magnitude) of the surface and the relative dimensions of dipoles.

The proposed antenna has a low-profile 3D structure that consists of a bevel-edge feed structure and a metal plate with folded strip. The bevel edge feed structure achieves broadband impedance matching and the metal plate acts as the main radiator. Moreover, the folded strip not only extends the lower frequency band but also provides additional resonant frequency around 6 GHz. The final bandwidth covers from 3.1 GHz to 12 GHz. The proposed antenna shows the directional patterns with low backward radiation due to the patch-like structure and the ground plane also prevents from the proximity effects of human bodies. Furthermore, the simulated SAR values of the proposed antenna are lower than the values of omnidirectional disc planar monopole.

The scheme consists of a ultrawideband antenna and a reconfigurable narrowband antenna in close proximity to one another. The narrowband reconfigurability is achieved by a integrating laser diodes within the antenna structure to control the switching state of photoconductive silicon switches. This scheme has the advantage of eliminating the use of optical fiber cables to guide light to the switches, and enables easier integration of the reconfigurable antenna in a complete communication system. The performance of the proposed technique is presented, and comparisons are made to other commonly used switching techniques for reconfigurable antennas, such as techniques based on PIN diodes and RF microlectromechanical systems integration. The application of this antenna design scheme serving as the receive channel in a cognitive radio communication link is also demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of a Cognitive Radio Front End Using an Optically Pumped Reconfigurable Antenna System (OPRAS)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173139","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142637/06059493.pdf","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of a Cognitive Radio Front End Using an Optically Pumped Reconfigurable Antenna System (OPRAS)","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6059493/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509079","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of a Cognitive Radio Front End Using an Optically Pumped Reconfigurable Antenna System (OPRAS)","sourcePdf":"tap-tawk-2173139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165744S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6142637","articleId":"6059493","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6059500,"authors":[{"name":"Beg\u00fcm Demir","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6186874/6059500/6059500-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beg\u00fcm Demir (S'06\u2013M'11) received the B.S., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic and telecommunication engineering from Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey, in 2005, 2007, and 2010, respectively.","In 2005, she joined Kocaeli University Laboratory of Image and Signal Processing (KULIS) as a Researcher, and she was a Research Assistant in the same department of Kocaeli University from 2006 to 2010.

The proposed AL technique is developed in the framework of the Bayes' rule for compound classification. At each iteration, it selects the pair of spatially aligned unlabeled pixels in the two images that are classified with the maximum uncertainty. These pixels are then labeled by an external supervisor and included in the training set. The uncertainty of a pair of pixels is assessed by the joint entropy defined by considering two possible different simplifying assumptions: 1) class-conditional independence and 2) temporal independence between multitemporal images. Accordingly, different algorithms are introduced. The proposed joint-entropy-based AL algorithms for compound classification are compared with each other and with a marginal-entropy-based AL technique (in which the entropy is computed separately on single-date images) applied to the postclassification comparison method. The experimental results obtained on two multispectral and multitemporal data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2168534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6186874/06059500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2168534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186874","startPage":"1930","endPage":"1941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Land-Cover Transitions in Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images With Active-Learning-Based Compound Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Land-Cover Transitions in Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images With Active-Learning-Based Compound Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12691951","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6059500/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Land-Cover Transitions in Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images With Active-Learning-Based Compound Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bruzzone-2168534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09485S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6186874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6186874","articleId":"6059500","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6059502,"authors":[{"name":"Shengyong Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6133473/6059502/6059502-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shengyong Chen (M'01\u2013SM'10) received the Ph.D. degree in computer vision from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2003.","He joined the Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, in February 2004, where he is currently a Professor in the Department of Computer Science.

One major issue that could strongly impede the progress of such efforts is the lack of understanding of the mathematical properties of the SSIM measure. For example, some highly desirable properties such as convexity and triangular inequality that are possessed by the mean squared error may not hold. In this paper, we first construct a series of normalized and generalized (vector-valued) metrics based on the important ingredients of SSIM. We then show that such modified measures are valid distance metrics and have many useful properties, among which the most significant ones include quasi-convexity, a region of convexity around the minimizer, and distance preservation under orthogonal or unitary transformations. The groundwork laid here extends the potentials of SSIM in both theoretical development and practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2173206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6170603/06059504.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2173206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mathematical Properties of the Structural Similarity Index","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059504/","displayDocTitle":"On the Mathematical Properties of the Structural Similarity Index","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12615442","pubMedId":"22042163","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6059504/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mathematical Properties of the Structural Similarity Index","sourcePdf":"tip-brunet-2173206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117149S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"6170603","articleId":"6059504","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":6059507,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy H.

To find a suboptimal solution of the arising non-convex optimization problem, we introduce new auxiliary variables representing the di- vision of the per-user rate constraints into per-stream rate targets, and we optimize these variables by means of gradient-projection steps. This new method is combined with alternating updates of the transmit and receive filters. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm ensures that the mean square error (MSE) matrices of all users are diagonal, and in the course of the execution of the algorithm, it is possible that inactive streams get activated if this leads to a decreased sum transmit power. In numerical simulations, the new algorithm turns out to be superior to the various existing methods since these methods either lead to a higher sum transmit power than the proposed scheme or have a higher computational complexity or make restrictive assumptions on the system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2173337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06059514.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2173337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","startPage":"877","endPage":"890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient-Based Power Minimization in MIMO Broadcast Channels With Linear Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gradient-Based Power Minimization in MIMO Broadcast Channels With Linear Precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12461105","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6059514/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient-Based Power Minimization in MIMO Broadcast Channels With Linear Precoding","sourcePdf":"tsp-hellings-2173337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116942S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6126210","articleId":"6059514","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6059515,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-Ho Hur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Samsung Electronics Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6059515/6059515-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seong-Ho (Paul) Hur (S'10\u2013M'11) received the B.Sc. degree with honors and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, San Diego, in 2011.","He worked at Samsung Electronics in South Korea from 1998 to 2006 as a layer 1 software engineer in the baseband cellular modem chipset development for 2G and 3G technology.

We recently found the right form of water-filling, polite water-filling, for capacity or achievable regions of the general MIMO interference networks, named B-MAC networks, which include BC, MAC, interference channels, X networks, and most practical wireless networks as special cases. In this paper, we extend the polite water-filling results from a single linear constraint to multiple linear constraints and use weighted sum-rate maximization as an example to show how to design high efficiency and low complexity algorithms, which find optimal solution for convex cases and locally optimal solution for nonconvex cases. Several times faster convergence speed and orders of magnitude higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art are demonstrated by numerical examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polite Water-Filling for Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization in MIMO B-MAC Networks Under Multiple Linear Constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2173334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06059516.pdf","startPage":"834","endPage":"847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2173334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059516/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Polite Water-Filling for Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization in MIMO B-MAC Networks Under Multiple Linear Constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12485663","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polite Water-Filling for Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization in MIMO B-MAC Networks Under Multiple Linear Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-luo-2173334-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058512S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6059516","onlineDate":"24 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6059517,"authors":[{"name":"Azam Khalili","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Azam","lastName":"Khalili","id":"37529090700"},{"name":"Mohammad Ali Tinati","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Ali","lastName":"Tinati","id":"37396301400"},{"name":"Amir Rastegarnia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University of Technology, Urmia, Iran","Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Rastegarnia","id":"37541484400"},{"name":"Jonathon A.

This paper proposes a random rotation-based binary-weighted selection (RRBS) that efficiently performs dynamic-element matching (DEM) by randomly rotating the sequence of these units to form new binary-weighted current groups for each DAC output. Without using binary-to-thermometer decoders, RRBS features its simplicity and compactness of DEM realization. Compared to conventional binary-weighted DACs, RRBS DACs are insensitive to the mismatch of small-size current-sources and exhibit better dynamic performance.

It is envisioned that, in the near future, cloud computing will have a significant impact on the educational and learning environment, enabling their own users (i.e., learners, instructors, and administrators) to perform their tasks effectively with less cost by utilizing the available cloud-based applications offered by the cloud service providers. This paper discusses the use of cloud computing in the educational and learning arena, to be called \u201cEducation and Learning as a Service\u201d (ELaaS), emphasizing its possible benefits and offerings. It is essential for an educational and learning organization, with its budget restrictions and sustainability challenges, to use the cloud formation best suited for a particular IT activity.

In this paper, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the antenna beam to eliminate redundant reader based on real directional reader antenna pattern.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2011.6059921","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIMSA) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045560/6059909/06059921.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIMSA) Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2011.6059921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm based efficient tag detection in RFID reader networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Genetic algorithms","Directive antennas","Biological cells","Optimization","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms","omnidirectional antennas","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","efficient tag detection","RFID reader networks","radiofrequency identification","dense deployment","omnidirectional reader antenna pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID","Antenna","Reader-Coverage","Optimization","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based efficient tag detection in RFID reader networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6059921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341256","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based efficient tag detection in RFID reader networks","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569453115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069405S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045560","isNumber":"6059909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045560","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6059909","articleId":"6059921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059932,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Motiian","affiliation":["Control and Intelligent Processing Center of Excellence, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Motiian","id":"38302097200"},{"name":"Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh","affiliation":["Image Analysis Laboratory, Radiology Department, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA","Control and Intelligent Processing Center of Excellence, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Soltanian-Zadeh","id":"38277189800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-925-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-924-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-923-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1555"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1547"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-1547"}],"articleNumber":"6059932","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an algorithm based on social intelligence, utilized in many fields of optimization. In applications like speech recognition, due to existence of high dimensional matrices, the speed of standard PSO is very low. In addition, PSO may be trapped in a local optimum. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that is faster and generates superior results than the standard PSO. Also, the probability of being trapped in a local optimum is decreased. To illustrate advantages of the proposed algorithm, we use it to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and find the minimum of the Ackley function.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIMSA) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045560/6059909/06059932.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIMSA) Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2011.6059932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2011.6059932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved particle swarm optimization and applications to Hidden Markov Model and Ackley function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training","Particle swarm optimization","Speech processing","Educational institutions","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","matrix algebra","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","hidden Markov model","Ackley function","social intelligence","speech recognition","high dimensional matrix","standard PSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Hidden Markov Model","Optimization","Ackley function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improved particle swarm optimization and applications to Hidden Markov Model and Ackley function","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6059932/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341267","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved particle swarm optimization and applications to Hidden Markov Model and Ackley function","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569456667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046635S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045560","isNumber":"6059909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045560","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6059909","articleId":"6059932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6059956,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Ming","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences & Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Ming","id":"38022669000"},{"name":"Haibin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38026099100"},{"name":"Debin Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Debin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37653368000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0460-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0458-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0459-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6059956","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Training","Monitoring","Analytical models","Semantics","Sockets","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground truthing observations","gray box anomaly detection","zero day exploits","file descriptor","socket descriptor","taint analysis","host based anomaly detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","taint analysis","system call monitor","ground truthing"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection has been attracting interests from researchers due to its advantage of being able to detect zero-day exploits. A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044613/6059944/06059956.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6059956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6059956/","displayDocTitle":"Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12342888","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6059956/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"NSS2011Full04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051413S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044613","isNumber":"6059944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044613","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6059944","articleId":"6059956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"}]
