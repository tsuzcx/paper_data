The clock frequency can be halved to relax the settling time of the OPAMPs to achieve the similar performance concerning the signal to noise ratio with the conventional sigma delta modulator, which decreases the power dissipation.

Virtualization also has the potential to enhance security by providing isolated execution environments for different applications that require different levels of security. For security-critical applications, it is highly desirable to have a small trusted computing base (TCB), since it minimizes the surface of attacks that could jeopardize the security of the entire system. In traditional virtualization architectures, the TCB for an application includes not only the hardware and the virtual machine monitor (VMM), but also the whole management operating system (OS) that contains the device drivers and virtual machine (VM) management functionality. For many applications, it is not acceptable to trust this management OS, due to its large code base and abundance of vulnerabilities. For example, consider the \"computing-as-a-service\u201d scenario where remote users execute a guest OS and applications inside a VM on a remote computing platform. It would be preferable for many users to utilize such a computing service without being forced to trust the management OS on the remote platform. In this paper, we address the problem of providing a secure execution environment on a virtualized computing platform under the assumption of an untrusted management OS. We propose a secure virtualization architecture that provides a secure runtime environment, network interface, and secondary storage for a guest VM. The proposed architecture significantly reduces the TCB of security-critical guest VMs, leading to improved security in an untrusted management environment. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed approach using the Xen virtualization system, and demonstrated how it can be used to facilitate secure remote computing services. We evaluate the performance penalties incurred by the proposed architecture, and demonstrate that the penalties are minimal.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2011.30","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/6365209/05928312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2011.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365209","startPage":"472","endPage":"483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Trusted Virtual Machine in an Untrusted Management Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Trusted Virtual Machine in an Untrusted Management Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2012","accessionNumber":"13150448","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5928312/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trusted Virtual Machine in an Untrusted Management Environment","sourcePdf":"tsc2012040472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193059S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6365209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6365209","articleId":"5928312","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928315,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/6472240/5928315/5928315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Chen received the BS degree in information and computing science from the Beijing Information Technology Institute, China, in 2008.

Although service recommendation has been studied in the recent literature, the performance of existing ones is not satisfactory, since (1) previous approaches fail to consider the QoS variance according to users' locations; and (2) previous recommender systems are all black boxes providing limited information on the performance of the service candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative filtering algorithm designed for large-scale web service recommendation. Different from previous work, our approach employs the characteristic of QoS and achieves considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy. To help service users better understand the rationale of the recommendation and remove some of the mystery, we use a recommendation visualization technique to show how a recommendation is grouped with other choices. Comprehensive experiments are conducted using more than 1.5 million QoS records of real-world web service invocations.

We propose leveraging these relationships to form a dynamic \"Social Cloud,\u201d thereby enabling users to share heterogeneous resources within the context of a social network. In addition, the inherent socially corrective mechanisms (incentives, disincentives) can be used to enable a cloud-based framework for long term sharing with lower privacy concerns and security overheads than are present in traditional cloud environments. Due to the unique nature of the Social Cloud, a social market place is proposed as a means of regulating sharing. The social market is novel, as it uses both social and economic protocols to facilitate trading. This paper defines Social Cloud computing, outlining various aspects of Social Clouds, and demonstrates the approach using a social storage cloud implementation in Facebook.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/6365209/05928319.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2011.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2011.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social Cloud Computing: A Vision for Socially Motivated Resource Sharing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social network services","Cloud computing","Resource management","Computational modeling","Facebook"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data","social networking (online)","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social cloud computing","socially motivated resource sharing","online relationships","social networks","real world relationships","heterogeneous resources","socially corrective mechanisms","disincentives","cloud-based framework","long term sharing","privacy concerns","security overheads","cloud environments","social market place","regulating sharing","social protocols","economic protocols","social storage cloud implementation","Facebook"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Social Cloud","social networks","cloud computing","services computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Social Cloud Computing: A Vision for Socially Motivated Resource Sharing","volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5928319/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2012","accessionNumber":"13150449","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social Cloud Computing: A Vision for Socially Motivated Resource Sharing","sourcePdf":"tsc2012040551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09356S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6365209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"6365209","articleId":"5928319","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928322,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Hua","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6189397/5928322/5928322-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Hua received the BE and PhD degrees in computer science from the Wuhan University, China, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

In this paper, we extend the standard Bloom filter to Locality-Sensitive Bloom Filter (LSBF) to provide Approximate Membership Query (AMQ) service. We achieve this by replacing uniform and independent hash functions with locality-sensitive hash functions. Such replacement makes the storage in LSBF to be locality sensitive. Meanwhile, LSBF is space efficient and query responsive by employing the Bloom filter design. In the design of the LSBF structure, we propose a bit vector to reduce False Positives (FP). The bit vector can verify multiple attributes belonging to one member. We also use an active overflowed scheme to significantly decrease False Negatives (FN). Rigorous theoretical analysis (e.g., on FP, FN, and space overhead) shows that the design of LSBF is space compact and can provide accurate response to approximate membership queries. We have implemented LSBF in a real distributed system to perform extensive experiments using real-world traces. Experimental results show that LSBF, compared with a baseline approach and other state-of-the-art work in the literature (SmartStore and LSB-tree), takes less time to respond AMQ and consumes much less storage space.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6189397/05928322.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6189397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locality-Sensitive Bloom Filter for Approximate Membership Query","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Locality-Sensitive Bloom Filter for Approximate Membership Query","volume":"61","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12690230","htmlLink":"/document/5928322/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locality-Sensitive Bloom Filter for Approximate Membership Query","sourcePdf":"ttc2012060817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08439S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6189397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6189397","articleId":"5928322","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928323,"authors":[{"name":"Mun-Kyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Mun-Kyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405520600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5928323","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"In 2008, Dimitrov et al. proposed a point multiplication algorithm on Koblitz curves using multiple-base expansions.

Consequently, researchers have proposed dedicated hardware architectures, utilizing a variety of classification algorithms targeting object detection. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is among the most popular classification algorithms used in object detection yielding high accuracy rates. However, existing SVM hardware implementations attempting to speed up SVM classification, have either targeted only simple applications, or SVM training. As such, there are limited proposed hardware architectures that are generic enough to be used in a variety of object detection applications. Hence, this paper presents a parallel array architecture for SVM-based object detection, in an attempt to show the advantages, and performance benefits that stem from a dedicated hardware solution. The proposed hardware architecture provides parallel processing, resource sharing among the processing units, and efficient memory management. Furthermore, the size of the array is scalable to the hardware demands, and can also handle a variety of applications such as multiclass classification problems. A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented on an FPGA platform and evaluated using three popular detection applications, demonstrating real-time performance (40-122 fps for a variety of applications).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6189397/05928327.pdf","startPage":"831","endPage":"842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6189397","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Object Detection with Support Vector Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Object detection","Decision support systems","Arrays","Hardware","Handheld computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","object detection","parallel architectures","resource allocation","storage management","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel hardware architecture","real-time object detection","support vector machines","real-time performance constraints","embedded environment","SVM hardware implementations","SVM classification","SVM training","parallel array architecture","parallel processing","resource sharing","memory management","multiclass classification problems","FPGA platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field programmable gate array (FPGA)","support vector machines","object detection","parallel architecture."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Object Detection with Support Vector Machines","volume":"61","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5928327/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12690234","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Object Detection with Support Vector Machines","sourcePdf":"ttc2012060831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070979S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6189397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6189397","articleId":"5928327","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928340,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Liao","affiliation":["Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/6200787/5928340/5928340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miao Liao received the BS degree from Tsinghua University in 2005.

In addition to the widely used structure from motion (SFM) techniques, we develop two new methods that analyze the optical flow to provide additional qualitative depth constraints. They remove the camera movement restriction imposed by SFM so that general motions can be used in scene depth estimation-the central problem in mono-to-stereo conversion. With these algorithms, the user's labeling task is significantly simplified. We further developed a quadratic programming approach to incorporate both quantitative depth and qualitative depth (such as these from user scribbling) to recover dense depth maps for all frames, from which stereoscopic view can be synthesized. In addition to visual results, we present user study results showing that our approach is more intuitive and less labor intensive, while producing 3D effect comparable to that from current state-of-the-art interactive algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928340/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","volume":"18","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12728240","pubMedId":"21690648","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5928340/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Video Stereolization: Combining Motion Analysis with User Interaction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Stereolization: Combining Motion Analysis with User Interaction","sourcePdf":"ttg2012071079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074672S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6200787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6200787","articleId":"5928340","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5928360,"authors":[{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/5995186/5928360/5928360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mugen Peng (SM'11) received the Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunication (BUPT), China, in 2005.","He is an Associate Professor with the Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication (Ministry of Education) in BUPT.

HSPA+ is an effort to further improve radio performance of HSPA, and wideband CDMA (WCDMA) HSPA+ and time division-synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA) HSPA+ (TD-HSPA+) are two HSPA+ systems evolving from WCDMA and TD-SCDMA, respectively. Different from WCDMA HSPA+ system, TD-HSPA+ system utilizes eight antennas at Node B and two antennas at user equipment (UE) for 8 x 2 Multi-Input and Multi-Output (MIMO) transmission to achieve antenna array gain and diversity gain. Furthermore, to facilitate 8 x 2 MIMO configuration, the antenna elements are partitioned into two groups for dual-polarization transmissions. This paper focuses on 8 x 2 MIMO schemes in TD-HSPA+ systems, including the traditional single polarized MIMO (SP-MIMO), the separated and the joint singular value decomposition (SVD) based precoding dual-polarized MIMO (DP-MIMO) schemes. Performances of these TD-HSPA+ MIMO schemes are evaluated for both urban macro and micro scenarios. The simulation results show that the separated SVD based precoding DP-MIMO scheme performs better than the joint SVD based precoding DP-MIMO scheme, and the DP-MIMO scheme offers almost the same performance as the SP-MIMO due to the beamforming diversity gain and multiplex gain in TD-HSPA+ systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5995186/05928360.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2011.2158696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2011.2158696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Dual-Polarized MIMO for TD-HSPA Evolution Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Mobile communication","Diversity methods","Channel estimation","Multiaccess communication","Singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","code division multiple access","diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","polarisation","radio access networks","singular value decomposition","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO","TD-HSPA evolution systems","dual polarisation transmission","code division multiple access","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","high speed packet access","wideband CDMA","time division synchronous CDMA","WCDMA","TD-SCDMA","user equipment","multiple input and multiple output","antenna array gain","diversity gain","singular value decomposition","precoding","SVD","beamforming diversity gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TDD","HSPA","dual-polarized MIMO","single-polarized MIMO","singular value decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Dual-Polarized MIMO for TD-HSPA Evolution Systems","volume":"5","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5928360/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12502673","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Dual-Polarized MIMO for TD-HSPA Evolution Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-chen-2158696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075672S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5995186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5995186","articleId":"5928360","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5928364,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Peters","affiliation":["Fritz Huettinger Microelectronics, Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5934463/5928364/5928364-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Peters (S'07\u2013M'09) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in microsystems engineering and the Dr.-Ing. degree from the Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany, in 2003 and 2009, respectively, both with highest honors.","He is currently with the University of Freiberg, Germany.

Most of the work on energy-detection-based spectrum sensing presented in the literature employ a filter bank (FB) to split the wideband input signal into several subbands and detect the spectrum by computing the energy of subbands. However, for a mobile CR handset, a filter-bank-based spectrum sensing is not an area- and power-efficient scheme. In this paper, a novel spectrum-sensing scheme based on a reconfigurable digital downconverter (RDDC) and a reconfigurable filter based on coefficient decimation is proposed for mobile CR handsets, which has very low complexity and high flexibility compared to conventional FB approaches. The basic idea is to rotate the spectrum using an RDDC and filter the desired portion of the spectrum using the reconfigurable filter, which then results in very low complexity. The implementation results on Virtex-4 field-programmable gate array show that our method offers significant reductions in gate count, power consumption, and delay over conventional discrete Fourier transform FB-based spectrum sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","volume":"58","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"12084188","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928395/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Flexible Spectrum-Sensing Scheme for Mobile Cognitive Radio Terminals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity Flexible Spectrum-Sensing Scheme for Mobile Cognitive Radio Terminals","sourcePdf":"tcsii-mahesh-2158167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068609S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5934470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5934470","articleId":"5928395","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5928396,"authors":[{"name":"Indrit Myderrizi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Dogus University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Indrit","lastName":"Myderrizi","id":"37283123300"},{"name":"Shahram Minaei","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Dogus University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Minaei","id":"37276406500"},{"name":"Erkan Yuce","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Pamukkale University, Denizli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erkan","lastName":"Yuce","id":"37418924400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5928396","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":625},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928396","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Resistors","Layout","CMOS integrated circuits","Topology","RLC circuits","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","circuit tuning","CMOS integrated circuits","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronically fine-tunable multiinput-single-output universal filter","MISO universal filter","filter circuit","active transistor","power consumption reduction","AMS CMOS process technology","active filter","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active filters","multi-input single-output (MISO)","universal filters"]}],"abstract":"A new electronically fine-tunable multi-input-single-output (MISO) universal filter is proposed.

The system is based on spectral ratio values as input features and a modified version of probabilistic neural network (PNN), named Quick PNN (QPNN), as a classifier. The use of spectral ratio values makes the system more efficient in detecting the minor changes in cloud spectral properties, leading to better classification capability. The modification to PNN consists of shrinking the hidden layer which is accomplished by performing K-means clustering on the training data of each class separately. Thus, for each class, instead of presenting all the training data samples in the hidden layer nodes, only the means of the resultant clusters are presented. The training data and the class labels are derived through the generation and interpretation of ratio images. The application of the approach to Meteosat-8 images has shown the separation of eight classes, including low clouds, middle clouds, high clouds, areas of high water vapor, sea surface, and land. The average accuracy of the system is 87.15% with a range of 84%-91% for the cloud and area of high water vapor classes, 93% for sea surface class, and 85% for land surface class. The computation time of the classification mode, including image ratioing and QPNN operations, is less than 1 min, which is good for continuous cloud classification and monitoring. The approach can be adapted to any multichannel satellite sensor only by using proper combination of ratio images.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2153863","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6079322/05928406.pdf","startPage":"5008","endPage":"5015","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2153863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System Based on Ratio Images and Quick Probabilistic Neural Network for Continuous Cloud Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A System Based on Ratio Images and Quick Probabilistic Neural Network for Continuous Cloud Classification","volume":"49","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12376473","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928406/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System Based on Ratio Images and Quick Probabilistic Neural Network for Continuous Cloud Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tahir-2153863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057674S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6079322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6079322","articleId":"5928406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5928407,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Gasparini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trent, Trent, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6064350/5928407/5928407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Gasparini (S'10) received the B.Sc. degree and the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Trent, Trent, Italy, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

We evaluated the magnetic bearing structures by using the 4-pole 4-segment type and 4-pole Halbach array, which were placed around cylindrical permanent magnet sets as field magnets. The comparison of magnetic flux density in the radial direction measured by finite-element analysis indicated that the Halbach array has advantages over the 4-segment type in terms of the total harmonic distortion and internal magnetic influence. Additionally, levitation and rotation tests were performed by implementing each bearing configuration in a newly developed equipment. In both bearing configurations, stable levitation at zero-power position was established and high-speed rotation up to around 16 000 rpm was achieved. As a result, the Halbach array slightly saved electric power.

Then the hidden layer is generated online, which consists of a growing step according to the plant dynamics and a revised pruning step used to refine the hidden structure such that the generated model can be a minimal realization with satisfactory performance. The algorithm is capable of adjusting both the network structure and weights simultaneously by using of weight variations as the conditions of structure optimization. An integrated performance including the identification error and an additional entropy penalty term is employed such that the model can attenuate the non-Gaussian noises as well as match the unknown plant automatically with a suitable structure. Convergence of the weights is guaranteed by suitably choosing the learning rates. The proposed DSONN can be established without a priori knowledge of the unknown nonlinearity.

The proposed scheme addresses such practical difficulties by providing: 1) robust and simple active damping control performance under grid and filter parameter variation; 2) suppression of grid-induced distortion without a-priori knowledge of the grid background distortion and unbalance via real-time generation of the frequency modes and disturbances that should be eliminated from the closed-loop current control system; 3) robust deadbeat digital control performance that maximizes the dynamic performance of the converter; and 4) robustness against interaction dynamics between active damping and current tracking controllers. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme facilitates line-voltage sensorless current control and grid-synchronization performance, which enhances the reliability and cost measures of the DG interface.

Compared to the voltage source DAB converter, the proposed converter allows low RMS current and maintains zero voltage switching (ZVS) in the whole operating range by keeping the ratio between primary side and secondary side DC-link voltage constant, leading to high efficient energy conversion over a wide input voltage range. In addition, the ZVS conditions can be maintained using small DC inductors and the input current ripple still remains small because of high DC inductor current ripples being alleviated by three-phase interleaving structure. Furthermore, the proposed topology with Y-Y connected transformers is proven to have better current sharing capability compared with other three-phase topologies with different transformer connections. The operation mode analysis, soft switching conditions, and hardware design guidelines are derived in this paper. A 6-kW hardware prototype with input voltage range of 24~48 V and rated 288 V output voltage is developed and tested in the laboratory. The experimental results verified that the proposed converter could maintain high efficiency over a wide input voltage and power range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928423/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12426062","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5928423/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Soft Switching Three-phase Current-fed Bidirectional DC-DC Converter With High Efficiency Over a Wide Input Voltage Range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Soft Switching Three-phase Current-fed Bidirectional DC-DC Converter With High Efficiency Over a Wide Input Voltage Range","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2160284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082118S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6112283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6112283","articleId":"5928423","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":5928424,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6112283/5928424/5928424-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Wang (S\u201909\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 1996, and M.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002, both in electrical engineering.

Along with the phase shift control managing the power flow between the ports, asymmetric duty cycle is applied to each port to maintain a constant DC bus voltage at low voltage side, which as a result will achieve wide zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) range for each port under varied ultracapacitor and battery voltages. The ZVS range analysis of different duty cycle control methods as well as the circulation power loss between the ports have been analyzed. In addition, the power flow design featuring the reduced coupling factors between the ports have been developed for the three-port bidirectional DC-DC converter. A fuel cell vehicle power train including a 2.5 kW three-port DC-DC converter interfacing a 12 V battery and ultracapacitor was built in the laboratory. The proposed asymmetrical duty cycle control and power flow design was implemented and verified on the hardware test bed under urban driving cycle. The experimental results validated that proposed asymmetrical duty cycle method has higher efficiency than other methods; furthermore, they also validated the reduced coupling factor between phase shift control and duty cycle control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6112283/05928424.pdf","startPage":"891","endPage":"904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2160405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2160405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetrical Duty Cycle Control and Decoupled Power Flow Design of a Three-port Bidirectional DC-DC Converter for Fuel Cell Vehicle Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supercapacitors","Batteries","Topology","Bidirectional control","Fuel cell vehicles","Zero voltage switching","Fuel cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","DC-DC power convertors","fuel cell vehicles","load flow control","supercapacitors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetrical duty cycle control method","decoupled power flow design","three-port bidirectional DC-DC converter","low voltage battery","ultracapacitor","DC bus voltage","zero voltage switch","ZVS range analysis","circulation power loss","fuel cell vehicle power train","hardware test bed","urban driving cycle","reduced coupling factor","phase shift control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetrical duty cycle control","fuel cell vehicle","power flow design","three-port bidirectional DC-DC converter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetrical Duty Cycle Control and Decoupled Power Flow Design of a Three-port Bidirectional DC-DC Converter for Fuel Cell Vehicle Application","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5928424/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12436977","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetrical Duty Cycle Control and Decoupled Power Flow Design of a Three-port Bidirectional DC-DC Converter for Fuel Cell Vehicle Application","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2160405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066838S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6112283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6112283","articleId":"5928424","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5928426,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6112283/5928426/5928426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Yang was born in Sichuan, China, in 1981.

The improved transformerless inverter can sustain the same low input voltage as the full-bridge inverter and guarantee to completely meet the condition of eliminating common-mode leakage current. Both the unipolar sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) as well as the double-frequency SPWM control strategy can be applied to implement the three-level output in the presented inverter. The high efficiency and convenient thermal design are achieved thanks to the decoupling of two additional switches connected to the dc side. Moreover, the higher frequency and lower current ripples are obtained by adopting the double-frequency SPWM, and thus the total harmonic distortion of the grid-connected current are reduced greatly. Furthermore, the influence of the phase shift between the output voltage and current, and the influence of the junction capacitances of the power switches are analyzed in detail.

In this context, most of the paper focuses on approaches that evolve decision trees as an alternate heuristics to the traditional top-down divide-and-conquer approach. Additionally, we present some alternative methods that make use of evolutionary algorithms to improve particular components of decision-tree classifiers. The paper's original contributions are the following. First, it provides an up-to-date overview that is fully focused on evolutionary algorithms and decision trees and does not concentrate on any specific evolutionary approach. Second, it provides a taxonomy, which addresses works that evolve decision trees and works that design decision-tree components by the use of evolutionary algorithms. Finally, a number of references are provided that describe applications of evolutionary algorithms for decision-tree induction in different domains. At the end of this paper, we address some important issues and open questions that can be the subject of future research.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2157494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2157494","startPage":"291","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/6182956/05928432.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6182956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Evolutionary Algorithms for Decision-Tree Induction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Evolutionary Algorithms for Decision-Tree Induction","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12673639","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5928432/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Evolutionary Algorithms for Decision-Tree Induction","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-barros-2157494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.207542S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"6182956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"6182956","articleId":"5928432","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5928437,"authors":[{"name":"Ju-Chieh Liu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6017249/5928437/5928437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ju-Chieh Liu was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1979.

The proposed hybrid MAC is a composite of conventional orthogonal and coherent MACs and is shown to offer more performance choices than both conventional channels in terms of mean square error (MSE) performance and system outage probability. Both random and deterministic scalar sources are considered for the hybrid MAC WSN in conjunction with linear minimum MSE and maximum-likelihood estimations, respectively. In particular, the optimal and suboptimal schemes are developed to allocate sensor power under the total power constraint, and these power allocation schemes are found to be similar in terms of algorithm and achievable estimation performance for both scalar sources. Moreover, closed-form expressions for sensor power are obtained for suboptimal power allocation, and two-step procedures are proposed to numerically solve the optimal power allocation problems. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions of MSE under various limiting parametric cases and system outage probability are analytically derived for suboptimal power allocation under a uniform sensor grouping strategy. It is analytically shown that, under a uniform sensor grouping strategy, the suboptimal power allocation scheme can asymptotically offer the same MSE performance as the optimal power allocation scheme when the number of sensors that transmit through the same coherent channel increases to infinity. Simulation results also show that the suboptimal power allocation scheme provides nearly optimal MSE performance for arbitrary sensor grouping strategies and that uniform sensor grouping is virtually the best grouping strategy. Moreover, for uniformly grouped hybrid MAC, the system outage probability for suboptimal power allocation is shown to provide a diversity order equal to the number of orthogonal channels when there are sufficiently many orthogonal channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Estimation in a Wireless Sensor Network Using Hybrid MAC","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2160302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05928437.pdf","startPage":"3424","endPage":"3435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2160302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Estimation in a Wireless Sensor Network Using Hybrid MAC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5928437/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Estimation in a Wireless Sensor Network Using Hybrid MAC","sourcePdf":"tvt-chung-2160302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106035S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5928437","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5928438,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Up Jang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology Convergence, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6017249/5928438/5928438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Up Jang (S'03\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2010.","From March 2010 to August 2010, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the KAIST Institute for Information Technology Convergence, where he has been a Senior Researcher since September 2010.

Simulation results demonstrate that, with a moderate increase in the memory requirement, the proposed algorithms achieve a significantly lower complexity than the SD algorithm in many scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2160464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2160464","startPage":"3503","endPage":"3509","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05928440.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Tree Search Algorithms for Detection in Spatial Multiplexing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Tree Search Algorithms for Detection in Spatial Multiplexing Systems","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","volume":"60","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12219115","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928440/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Tree Search Algorithms for Detection in Spatial Multiplexing Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-lai-2160464-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02366S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5928440","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5928442,"authors":[{"name":"Vilayanur V.

The economic viability for such vehicles is contingent upon the availability of cost-effective batteries with high power and energy density. For initial commercial success, government subsidies will be instrumental in allowing PHEVs and EVs to gain a foothold. However, in the long term, for electric vehicles to be commercially viable, the economics have to be self-sustaining. Toward the end of the battery life in the vehicle, the energy capacity left in the battery is not sufficient to provide the designed range for the vehicle. Typically, the automotive manufacturers recommend battery replacement when the remaining energy capacity reaches 70%-80%. There is still sufficient power (kilowatts) and energy capacity (kilowatthour) left in the battery to support various grid ancillary services such as balancing, spinning reserve, and load following. As renewable energy penetration increases, the need for such balancing services is expected to increase. This work explores optimality for the replacement of transportation batteries to be subsequently used for grid services. This analysis maximizes the value of an electric vehicle battery to be used as a transportation battery (in its first life) and, then, as a resource for providing grid services (in its second life). The results are presented across a range of key parameters, such as depth of discharge (DOD), number of batteries used over the life of the vehicle, battery life in the vehicle, battery state of health (SOH) at the end of life in the vehicle, and ancillary services rate. The results provide valuable insights for the automotive industry into maximizing the utility and the value of the vehicle batteries in an effort to either reduce the selling price of EVs and PHEVs or maximize the profitability of the emerging electrification of transportation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05928442.pdf","startPage":"2963","endPage":"2970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2160378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2160378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second Use of Transportation Batteries: Maximizing the Value of Batteries for Transportation and Grid Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Vehicles","US Department of Defense","Calendars","Degradation","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","hybrid electric vehicles","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transportation batteries","grid services","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","economic viability","cost-effective batteries","energy density","government subsidies","vehicle battery life","energy capacity","battery replacement","spinning reserve","load following","renewable energy penetration","electric vehicle battery","depth of discharge","battery state of health"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ancillary services","calendar life","depth of discharge (DOD)","electric vehicles (EVs)","state of health (SOH)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Second Use of Transportation Batteries: Maximizing the Value of Batteries for Transportation and Grid Services","volume":"60","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5928442/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219117","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second Use of Transportation Batteries: Maximizing the Value of Batteries for Transportation and Grid Services","sourcePdf":"tvt-viswanathan-2160378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050379S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5928442","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5928482,"authors":[{"name":"Chiao-En Chen","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Minhsiung, TW"],"firstName":"Chiao-En","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406732000"},{"name":"Wern-Ho Sheen","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wern-Ho","lastName":"Sheen","id":"37277915500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5928482","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":911},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","Detectors","Complexity theory","Lattices","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lattice reduction algorithm","LR-aided MIMO linear detection","suboptimal multiple-input multiple-output detectors","Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\u00e1sz algorithm","LLL algorithm","Seysen algorithm","SA","Euclidean distance","error rate performance","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lattice reduction","MIMO","Seysen's algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Lattice reduction (LR) has recently emerged as a promising technique for improving the performance of suboptimal multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) detectors.

In this paper, we propose a new way to encourage primary users to lease their spectrum: The secondary users (SU's) place bids indicating how much power they are willing to spend for relaying the primary signals to their destinations. In this formulation, the primary users achieve power savings due to asymmetric cooperation. We propose and analyze both a centralized and a distributed decision-making architecture for the secondary CRN. In the centralized architecture, a Secondary System Decision Center (SSDC) selects a bid for each primary channel based on optimal channel assignment for SU's. In the decentralized cognitive network architecture, we formulate an auction game-based protocol in which each SU independently places bids for each primary channel and receivers of each primary link pick the bid that will lead to the most power savings. A simple and robust distributed reinforcement learning mechanism is developed to allow the users to revise their bids and to increase their rewards. The performance results show the significant impact of reinforcement learning in both improving spectrum utilization and meeting individual SU performance requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.061311.102044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05928484.pdf","startPage":"2716","endPage":"2724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.061311.102044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric Cooperative Communications Based Spectrum Leasing via Auctions in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928484/","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Cooperative Communications Based Spectrum Leasing via Auctions in Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205953","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928484/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Cooperative Communications Based Spectrum Leasing via Auctions in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2716-tw1108-jaya.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058494S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5928484","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928485,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan M.

We assume that there are a total of K physical resources dedicated for the discovery purpose. Each node can pick one resource to transmit its node identifier on, and can receive on the remaining K-1 resources. We assume that node identifiers are broadcast via coded transmission on one single physical resource. This paper addresses link level strategies to increase the average number of discovered devices when N \u2245 aK, where a is the degree of density of the network. A classical strategy of discovering one node per resource would lead to a maximum of K-1 nodes being discovered. We focus on a multiple-access channel (MAC) scernario where multiple interferer users are jointly decoded. We propose a scheme to improve the performance. The method, based on iterative belief propagation on factor graph, is called joint iterative decoding (JID). It is shown, through system simulations, that JID may gain by significantly more than 100% over the classical single-user decoding, and by 20-25% over the successive interference cancellation (SIC).","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061311.100246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05928643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061311.100246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","startPage":"2296","endPage":"2305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Discovery in Synchronous Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Discovery in Synchronous Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206215","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928643/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Discovery in Synchronous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2296-tc1108-vigato.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078162S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5928643","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5928644,"authors":[{"name":"Jinfeng Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and the ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6020878/5928644/5928644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinfeng Du (S'07) received his B.Eng. degree in electronic information engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2004, his M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering, and his Tekn.

Through the use of MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology, the physical layer is able to superimpose multiple concurrent information flows, thereby increasing the communications parallelism in the network. We propose a cooperative cross-layer scheme that integrates distributed incremental redundancy hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) error control with routing in order to increase the efficiency of the transmissions and decrease the interference load in the network. In the proposed scheme, next hop relays are opportunistically selected during the HARQ process in order to avoid overloaded receivers and guarantee the geographical advancement of the packets. Thus, cooperation is used to both strengthen weak links and select the path to the destination. Numerical results are presented for a specific instantiation where a layered space-time multiuser detection (LASTMUD) transmitter-receiver architecture with spread-spectrum signals is implemented at the physical layer and packets are encoded with a linear erasure code (LEC).","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061311.090705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05928645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061311.090705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","startPage":"2215","endPage":"2227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Cooperative Opportunistic Packet Forwarding and Distributed Error Control in MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Cooperative Opportunistic Packet Forwarding and Distributed Error Control in MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206216","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928645/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Cooperative Opportunistic Packet Forwarding and Distributed Error Control in MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"2215-tc1108-levorato.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111017S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5928645","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928726,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Urien","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Urien","id":"37279947000"},{"name":"Marc Pasquet","affiliation":["GREYC CNRS UMR 6072 laboratory, Higher Education National Engineering School of Caen, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Pasquet","id":"37320065100"},{"name":"Christophe Kiennert","affiliation":["Ether Trust, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Kiennert","id":"37540389400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-639-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-638-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-637-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928726","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":277},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928726","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart cards","Cryptography","Servers","Companies","Authentication","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic data interchange","security of data","smart cards","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prepaid payment","end to end token exchange","secure SSL channels","EAP-TLS smart cards","innovative architecture","prepaid services","digital tokens","back-office server delivering tokens","front-office server","data exchange choreography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","EMV","TLS","WEB","Smart Card"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an innovative architecture for prepaid services.

In this paper, we design a secure mobile user-based data service mechanism (SDSM) to provide confidentiality and fine-grained access control for data stored in the cloud. This mechanism enables the mobile users to enjoy a secure outsourced data services at a minimized security management overhead. The core idea of SDSM is that SDSM outsources not only the data but also the security management to the mobile cloud in a trust way.

To protect the processed data, security services, i.e., encryption, decryption, authentications, etc., are performed in the cloud. In general, we can classify cloud security services in two categories: Critical Security (CS) service and Normal Security (NS) service. CS service provides strong security protection such as using longer key size, strict security access policies, isolations for protecting data, and so on. The CS service usually occupies more cloud computing resources, however it generates more rewards to the cloud provider since the CS service users need to pay more for using the CS service. With the increase of the number of CS and NS service users, it is important to allocate the cloud resource to maximize the system rewards with the considerations of the cloud resource consumption and incomes generated from cloud users. To address this issue, we propose a Security Service Admission Model (SSAM) based on Semi-Markov Decision Process to model the system reward for the cloud provider. We, first, define system states by a tuple represented by the numbers of cloud users and their associated security service categories, and current event type (i.e., arrival or departure).We then derive the system steady-state probability and service request blocking probability by using the proposed SSAM. Numerical results show that the obtained theoretic probabilities are consistent with our simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928806","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928806.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for security services in mobile cloud computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093525","htmlLink":"/document/5928806/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for security services in mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p191hongbin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077843S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928807,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Yu","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, South China University of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Rong Yu","id":"37087201431"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway"],"lastName":"Yan Zhang","id":"37087220519"},{"name":"Yanrong Chen","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, South China University of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Yanrong Chen","id":"37087307790"},{"name":"Chujia Huang","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, South China University of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Chujia Huang","id":"37087307914"},{"name":"Yang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Alabama, USA"],"lastName":"Yang Xiao","id":"37087157229"},{"name":"Mohsen Guizani","affiliation":["Information Science Department, Kuwait University, Kuwait"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Guizani","id":"37273043000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928807","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":902},"abstract":"It is envisioned that home networks will shift from the current machine-to-human communications to the machine-to-machine (M2M) paradigm with the rapid penetration of embedded devices in home surroundings. In this paper, we first proposed an architecture of home M2M networks that is decomposed into three sub-areas depending on the radio service ranges and potential applications. We then concentrate on the Quality-of-Service (QoS) management in home M2M networks. Although generic QoS architectures for home M2M networks have been proposed in existing standards, the concrete QoS schemes and algorithms are still missing. Based on the proposed architecture, a cross-layer design of distributed admission and rate control is put forwarded. This proposed scheme, named DRAC, is integrated with a game theory analysis module to model the competition of radio bandwidth among M2M home devices, and embrace the distributed operations of QoS-aware and fair sharing in transmission opportunities. Simulation results indicate that the proposed DRAC scheme allows the M2M home devices to intelligently share the radio bandwidth based on QoS demands in resource-constrained home M2M networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media","Multimedia communication","Delay","Admission control","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computer

paper we describe the process that we undertook to build a configurable wireless platform that can be used to implement cognitive radio network (CRN) architectures. Consisting of a commodity IEEE 802.11 a/b/g (WiFi) router at the physical (PHY) layer and RF signal processing and IP traffic shaping circuitry, the resultant hybrid terminal (called the WiFi CR) becomes a building block that can implement cognitive femtocells, point to multipoint, mesh, and relay wireless networks. The IP addressable WiFi CR terminals can sense their radio environment, schedule IEEE 802.11 packet transmissions in space and time, and select channel, modulation rates, and transmit power. Intelligent operation is undertaken by a cognitive network management system (CR NMS) which controls a number of WiFi CR terminals and solicits sensor information from them. The CR NMS gathers the spectrum and sensed interference information and builds a memory map with such knowledge, thereby creating radio environment awareness for the CRN. Cognitive engines (the intelligent control algorithms) within the CR NMS use radio environment knowledge and other information (such as spectrum policy) to give the system a capability to seek white space spectrum, avoid interference, identify primary users, and take on other tasks associated with cognitive radio (CR). Designed around ISM band operation, this generic terminal, with proper RF modifications, can work in the TV bands, 3.65-3.70 GHz, and up to 60 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12093527","htmlLink":"/document/5928808/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A generic cognitive radio based on commodity hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generic cognitive radio based on commodity hardware","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1sydor.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047877S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5928811,"authors":[{"name":"Ev\u015fen Yanmaz","affiliation":["Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES), University of Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Ev\u015fen","lastName":"Yanmaz","id":"37062983200"},{"name":"Robert Kuschnig","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology (ITEC), University of Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Kuschnig","id":"37395246900"},{"name":"Markus Quaritsch","affiliation":["Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES), University of Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Quaritsch","id":"37688268500"},{"name":"Christian Bettstetter","affiliation":["Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES), University of Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bettstetter","id":"37265503000"},{"name":"Bernhard Rinner","affiliation":["Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES), University of Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Rinner","id":"37267881100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928811","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":656},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928811","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Path planning","Routing","Planning","Robot sensing systems","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning strategies","autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle network","overview image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV networks","wireless sensor networks","mobility","coverage"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we compare deterministic and probabilistic path planning strategies for an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, where the objective is to explore a given area with obstacles and provide an overview image.

In this paper, an analytical queueing model is used to derive the probability of successful transmission, channel sensing time, and transmission quota, for each data channel. Each CR node records the derived statistics in a channel preference matrix. A CR pair selects a data channel for sensing and accessing based on the successful transmission probability. According to the derivations, we design a media access control protocol, which utilizes the powerful computation capability of cloud servers to estimate the behavior of PUs, for infrastructure-based cognitive radio networks. We validate the analytical model with simulation results. Besides, the proposed MAC protocol is compared with other approaches via simulation. The simulation results showed that our protocol performs well in both utilization of channel idle time and the average tries of channel search.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928818","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928818.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928818","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","startPage":"24","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decentralized MAC protocol for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A decentralized MAC protocol for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928818/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093537","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decentralized MAC protocol for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p24jiang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087754S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928819,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Scalia","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Scalia","id":"37296878600"},{"name":"Thorsten Biermann","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Biermann","id":"37706649800"},{"name":"Changsoon Choi","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Changsoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280244300"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Kozu","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Kozu","id":"37712991800"},{"name":"Wolfgang Kellerer","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Kellerer","id":"37284725800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928819","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":687},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Topology","Estimation","Optical network units","Integrated optics","IP networks","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","cellular radio","channel estimation","cooperative communication","power consumption","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless access systems","mobile backhaul network","CoMP","base station","cooperation techniques","coordinated multipoint","3GPP","4G system","channel estimation","cross-layer approach","power consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928819","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928819.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-efficient mobile backhaul design for CoMP support in future wireless access systems","abstract":"Base Stations (BSs) cooperation techniques, also referred to as Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) in the 3GPP terminology, promise significant performance gains in future 4G and beyond systems. The counterpart to such gains is represented by the challenging requirements that CoMP puts on the backhaul network, which may prevent the inclusion of certain BSs selected for the cooperative cluster. The consequences of such a failure can be relevant for the overall power consumption. Those BSs which are not eligible for cooperation would be unnecessarily included in the channel estimation process, which consumes power both at the BS side (sending of reference pilots) and on the backhaul network side (exchange of Channel State Information (CSI) between BSs). To limit the detrimental effects of such CoMP cluster \u201cunfeasibility\u201d, we discuss the benefits of a cross-layer approach which relates wireless CoMP requests to the backhaul network status. We show how the preemptive exclusion of the non-eligible BSs results in a considerable saving of the overall power consumption. We further complement our system by proposing optical bypass techniques aimed at improving the CoMP support from the backhaul perspective. This results, on one side, in the enhancement of the overall CoMP feasibility performance, and, on the other side, in the reduction of the consumed power thanks to the offload of IP processing to the switching layer1.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928819/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093538","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power-efficient mobile backhaul design for CoMP support in future wireless access systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-efficient mobile backhaul design for CoMP support in future wireless access systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p253scalia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050003S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5928824,"authors":[{"name":"Wenchi Cheng","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Wenchi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37676640100"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xi Zhang","id":"37279333400"},{"name":"Hailin Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hailin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293132300"},{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Qiang Wang","id":"37714564700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928824","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":891},"abstract":"The purpose of Green Communications is to reduce the energy consumption of the communication system as much as possible without compromising the quality of service (QoS) for users. An effective approach for Green Wireless Communications is On-Demand strategy, which scales power consumption with the volume and location of user demand. Applying the On-Demand Communications model, we propose a novel scheme-Wireless Resource Trading, which characterizes the trading relationship among different wireless resources for a given number of performance metrics. According to wireless resource trading relationship, different wireless resources can be consumed for the same set of performance metrics. Therefore, to minimize the energy consumption for given performance metrics, we can trade the other type of wireless resources for the energy resource under the demanded performance metrics. Based on the wireless resource trading relationship, we derive the optimal energy-bandwidth and energy-time wireless resource trading relationship for green wireless communications. We also develop an adaptive trading strategy by using different bandwidths or different delays for different transmission distances with available bandwidths and acceptable delay bounds in wireless networks. Our conducted simulations show that the energy consumption of wireless networks can be significantly reduced with our proposed wireless resources trading scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928824.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"288","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Demand based wireless resources trading for Green Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Delay","Wireless networks","Energy consumption","Energy resources","Green products"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","quality of service","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless resource trading","green communications","energy consumption","quality of service","QoS","power consumption","user demand","on-demand communications model","energy bandwidth","adaptive trading strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Green communications","On-Demand communications","wireless resources trading","energy saving"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"On-Demand based wireless resources trading for Green Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928824/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093543","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Demand based wireless resources trading for Green Communications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p283cheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053755S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5928828,"authors":[{"name":"Shengrong Bu","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Shengrong Bu","id":"37544252700"},{"name":"F.

Since most renewable sources are highly intermittent, they can induce significan fluctuation on the supply side of the power grid. On the other hand, the use of smart meters and smart appliances in the smart grid can cause significan uncertainties on the demand side as well. Unit commitment scheduling of power generation systems is an important issue in smart grid communications to coordinate energy demand and generation. In this paper, we study the stochastic unit commitment problem in smart grid communications. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used for renewable energy resources. The stochastic power demand loads are modeled by a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). We show that, under reasonable conditions on the smart grid, structural results can be derived for the unit commit problem, which make the solution practically useful. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928828.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic unit commitment in smart grid communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Smart grids","Generators","Renewable energy resources","Markov processes","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","load forecasting","power generation scheduling","power meters","renewable energy sources","smart power grids","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["renewable energy resources","smart power grid","smart meters","smart appliances","unit commitment scheduling","power generation systems","smart grid communications","energy demand side","hidden Markov models","stochastic power demand loads","Markov-modulated Poisson process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unit commitment","renewable energy","smart grid","power demand loads"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic unit commitment in smart grid communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928828/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093547","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic unit commitment in smart grid communications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p307bu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084118S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928829,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Ben Ghorbel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Ben Ghorbel","id":"37595076800"},{"name":"Andrea Goldsmith","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37269021300"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928829","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Pricing","Optimization","Receivers","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed algorithms","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","pricing","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA-based cognitive radio systems","spectrum sharing","primary users","pricing strategy","subchannel sharing","interference constraints","secondary user","sequential procedure","distributed algorithm","interference thresholds","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928829","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928829","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","abstract":"Cognitive users can share spectrum with primary users under constraints on the interference that results.

The primary users aim to maximize their revenues by sharing their subchannels with secondary users while ensuring that they achieve a minimum target capacity. On the other hand, the secondary users aim to maximize their capacity under three different constraints: consumed power, a given budget for sharing subchannels, and tolerable interference caused to the primary users. We introduce a sequential procedure based on a distributed algorithm to determine the resource allocation, interference thresholds and prices that satisfy the requirements of both parties in the network.

The network has one control channel and multiple service channels. On the control channel nodes acquire time slots in a distributed way, while on the service channels nodes are assigned time slots in a centralized manner. VeMAC decreases the probability of transmission collisions caused by node mobility by assigning disjoint sets of time slots to vehicles moving in opposite directions and to road side units. Analysis and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of VeMAC and compare it to ADHOC MAC, an existing MAC protocol based on TDMA. It is shown that, for the same number of contending nodes and available time slots, nodes can acquire time slots on the control channel much faster in VeMAC than in ADHOC MAC, when the number of available time slots is sufficiently larger than the number of contending nodes.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928848","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928848.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VeMAC: A novel multichannel MAC protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928848/","displayDocTitle":"VeMAC: A novel multichannel MAC protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093567","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928848/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VeMAC: A novel multichannel MAC protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p413omar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119787S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928851,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Kuscu","affiliation":["Next-generation Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Kuscu","id":"38518447900"},{"name":"Ozgur B.

FRET is a nonradiative energy transfer process between fluorescent molecules based on the dipole-dipole interactions of molecules. Energy is transferred rapidly from a donor to an acceptor molecule in a close proximity such as 0 to 10 nm without radiation of a photon. Low dependency on the environmental factors, controllability of its parameters and relatively wide transfer range make FRET a promising candidate to be used for a high rate nanoscale communication channel. In this paper, the simplest form of the FRET-based molecular communication channel for a single transmitter and a single receiver nanomachine is modeled. Furthermore, using the information theoretical approach, the capacity of the point-to-point communication channel is investigated and the dependency of the capacity on some environmental and intrinsic parameters is analyzed. It is shown that the capacity can be increased by appropriately selecting the donor-acceptor pair, the medium, the intermolecular distance and the orientation of the molecules.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928851.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"430","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nanoscale communication channel with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy exchange","Fluorescence","Proteins","Absorption","Nanoscale devices","Channel capacity","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","environmental factors","nanotechnology","radio links","receivers","transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanoscale communication channel","fluorescence resonance energy transfer","FRET","nonradiative energy transfer process","fluorescent molecule","dipole-dipole interaction","acceptor molecule","donor molecule","environmental factors","parameter controllability","FRET-based molecular communication channel","single transmitter nanomachine","single receiver nanomachine","point to point communication channel","donor-acceptor pair","intermolecular distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A nanoscale communication channel with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928851/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093570","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nanoscale communication channel with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p425akan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073768S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5928853,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Galluccio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e Informatica (DIEEI), Universita Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Galluccio","id":"37265701900"},{"name":"Sergio Palazzo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e Informatica (DIEEI), Universita Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Palazzo","id":"37282934000"},{"name":"Giuseppe E.

In such a case, the impossibility to move caused by an interruption in the propagation of nervous impulses, could be solved by exploiting nanomachines that employ the same communication paradigm of neurons to interact with them, thus allowing signal propagation across the body critical area. Accordingly, in this paper we perform a characterization and provide a model of the signal propagation between two entities which use a neuronal paradigm of communication, e.g. two neurons or a neuron and a nanomachine, so as to derive expressions of the transfer function, gain and delay incurred during the transmission. This could allow to design nanomachines compatible with the biological structures and able to integrate and substitute them when needed.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928853","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928853.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","startPage":"437","endPage":"442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of signal propagation in neuronal systems for nanomachine-to-neurons communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of signal propagation in neuronal systems for nanomachine-to-neurons communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928853/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093572","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928853/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of signal propagation in neuronal systems for nanomachine-to-neurons communications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p437galluccio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0588S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5928854,"authors":[{"name":"Nora Garralda","affiliation":["NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Nora","lastName":"Garralda","id":"38276005700"},{"name":"Ignacio Llatser","affiliation":["NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Llatser","id":"37704099800"},{"name":"Albert Cabellos-Aparicio","affiliation":["NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Cabellos-Aparicio","id":"38270272800"},{"name":"Massimiliano Pierobon","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Pierobon","id":"37394077900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928854","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Shape","Noise","Molecular communication","Modulation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanotechnology","pulse position modulation","pulse shaping","stochastic processes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation-based evaluation","diffusion-based physical channel","molecular nanonetworking","nanotechnology","molecular communication engineering","bioinspired paradigm","physical simulation framework","linear time invariant property","diffusion-based MC scenario","diffusion-based noise","stochastic model","optimal pulse shape","pulse-based coding technique","energy consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928854","abstract":"Nanonetworking is an emerging field of research, where nanotechnology and communication engineering are applied on a common ground.

In this work, we explore the main characteristics of diffusion-based MC through the use of N3Sim, a physical simulation framework for MC. N3Sim allows for the simulation of the physics underlying the diffusion of molecules for different scenarios. Through the N3Sim results, the Linear Time Invariant (LTI) property is proven to be a valid assumption for the free diffusion-based MC scenario. Moreover, diffusion-based noise is observed and evaluated with reference to already proposed stochastic models. The optimal pulse shape for diffusion-based MC is provided as a result of simulations.

How these nanomachines will communicate is still an open debate. Molecular communication is a promising paradigm that has been proposed to implement nanonetworks, i.e., the interconnection of nanomachines. Recent studies have attempted to model the physical channel of molecular communication, mainly from a communication or information-theoretical point of view. In this work, we focus on the diffusion-based molecular communication, whose physical channel is governed by Fick's laws of diffusion. We characterize the molecular channel following two complementary approaches: first, we obtain the channel impulse response, transfer function and group delay; second, we propose a pulse-based modulation scheme and we obtain analytical expressions for the most relevant performance evaluation metrics, which we also validate by simulation. Finally, we compare the scalability of these metrics with their equivalents in a wireless electromagnetic channel. We consider that these results provide interesting insights which may serve designers as a guide to implement future molecular nanonetworks.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928858","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928858.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion-based channel characterization in molecular nanonetworks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928858/","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion-based channel characterization in molecular nanonetworks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093577","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928858/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion-based channel characterization in molecular nanonetworks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p467llatser.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050208S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928865,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Nakano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37401740600"},{"name":"Jianwei Shuai","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Shuai","id":"37710632700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928865","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928865","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Repeaters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocommunications","molecular electronics","nanobiotechnology","repeaters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["repeater design","long distance molecular communication network","signal molecule","transmitter nanomachine","receiver nanomachine","molecular signal","biological model"]}],"abstract":"Molecular communication or communication based on molecules in aqueous environments often relies on free diffusion of signal molecules where a transmitter nanomachine releases signal molecules that randomly walk in the environments to reach the receiver nanomachine. Since the signal molecules randomly walk in the three dimensional environments, the number of molecules that can reach the receiver significantly decreases over distance. A challenge in molecular communication is therefore to overcome the attenuation of molecular signals over distance. In this paper, we investigate a design of repeater nanomachines that amplify signal molecules to enable molecular communication over extended distances. The repeater nanomachines are placed between a transmitter and the receiver, where signal molecules released by the transmitter are amplified by the intermediate repeaters to reach the receiver. A specific biological model and design of molecular communication are used for designing repeaters, with simulation results showing the conditions for the repeaters to amplify, signal molecules for long distance molecular communication.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928865","startPage":"501","endPage":"506","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928865.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeater design and modeling for molecular communication networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928865/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Repeater design and modeling for molecular communication networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12093584","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928865/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeater design and modeling for molecular communication networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p501nakano.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126099S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5928869,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Y.

Similarly, mobile sensors make it possible to have the flexibility of mobility in mobile sensor network (MSN) applications. Mobility can be exploited to connect partitioned WSANs and MSNs due to large scale damages or deployment problems. However, since mobility consume significant energy and it can be limited due to terrain constraints, the travel distance for the mobile nodes should be minimized in such a recovery effort. In this paper, we present a mathematical model which minimizes the total travel distance for connecting a given number of partitions. The idea is based on network flows and the problem is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear program. The nonlinear terms in the model are linearized using a polygon approximation for computational efficiency. We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach in terms of total distance as well as the time to reconnect the partitions. The results show that our approach outperforms the heuristic approach in terms of total distance and delay and reveals various trade-offs involved in connecting multiple partitions.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928869","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928869.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928869","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","startPage":"525","endPage":"530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimization-based approach for connecting partitioned mobile sensor/Actuator Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"An optimization-based approach for connecting partitioned mobile sensor/Actuator Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928869/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928869/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093588","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimization-based approach for connecting partitioned mobile sensor/Actuator Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p525sir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054305S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928870,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Chao Wang","id":"37538391700"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoyang Zhang","id":"37279636300"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoming Chen","id":"37403981600"},{"name":"Yuen Chau","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yuen Chau","id":"37717826300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928870","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Silicon","Quantization","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","MIMO","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","feedback","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter-receiver cooperative sensing","MIMO cognitive network","feedback","listen-before talk","LBT","channel state information","CSI","sensing information","MIMO link capacity","interference constraints"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a novel sensing scheme so-called Transmitter-Receiver Cooperative Sensing in a MIMO cognitive network by combining sensing information of both sides. Compared with most of the existing sensing schemes which simply use listen-before talk (LBT) only at the transmitter side, the proposed scheme can further improve the system performance by jointly feedback the Channel State Information (CSI) and the Sensing information (SI) from the receiver. However, the quantization impact on the sensing performance and the channel capacity as well as the interference to primary network should be considered in the case of limited feedback. Here a tradeoff criterion is proposed to allocate bits for CSI and SI so as to maximize the MIMO link capacity while meeting the interference constraints.

Under the half-duplex assumption and packet collision model, the primary and secondary instantaneous data rates are derived, as a function of the power allocation factor by the secondary user to relay the primary user's data. We study the optimal power allocation to maximize the secondary user's instantaneous data rate and long-term throughput, without degrading the primary user's spectrum utilization. Our numerical results suggest that these two performance criteria entail drastically different optimal behaviors by the secondary user. Furthermore, we observe that employing successive interference cancellation in relaying can significantly increase the instantaneous data rate, but after optimizing the power allocation factor, the simple decode-and-forward strategy almost always achieves the same throughput as the more complicated strategies.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928880","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928880.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928880","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data rate and throughput analysis of cooperative cognitive radio under a collision model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Data rate and throughput analysis of cooperative cognitive radio under a collision model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928880/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928880/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093599","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data rate and throughput analysis of cooperative cognitive radio under a collision model","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p57seyedmehdi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094647S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5928886,"authors":[{"name":"Dijiang Huang","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Dijiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37289786600"},{"name":"Zhibin Zhou","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291514800"},{"name":"Le Xu","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"lastName":"Le Xu","id":"37078556100"},{"name":"Tianyi Xing","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"lastName":"Tianyi Xing","id":"38498518800"},{"name":"Yunji Zhong","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"lastName":"Yunji Zhong","id":"37711713700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928886","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":2683},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Data processing","Cryptography","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure data processing framework","mobile cloud computing","information storage resource","health related information","user privacy","mobile cloud data processing framework","trust management","private data isolation","FocusDrive"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Privacy","Mobile Cloud","Data Security"]}],"abstract":"In mobile cloud computing, mobile devices can rely on cloud computing and information storage resource to perform computationally intensive operations such as searching, data mining, and multimedia processing.

Cloud data storage redefines the security issues targeted on customer's outsourced data (data that is not stored/retrieved from the costumers own servers). In this work we observed that, from a customer's point of view, relying upon a solo SP for his outsourced data is not very promising. In addition, providing better privacy as well as ensuring data availability, can be achieved by dividing the user's data block into data pieces and distributing them among the available SPs in such a way that no less than a threshold number of SPs can take part in successful retrieval of the whole data block. In this paper, we propose a secured cost-effective multi-cloud storage (SCMCS) model in cloud computing which holds an economical distribution of data among the available SPs in the market, to provide customers with data availability as well as secure storage. Our results show that, our proposed model provides a better decision for customers according to their available budgets.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928887.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A secured cost-effective multi-cloud storage in cloud computing","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A secured cost-effective multi-cloud storage in cloud computing","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093606","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928887/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A secured cost-effective multi-cloud storage in cloud computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p619singh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10809S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928889,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309102600"},{"name":"Baochun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Baochun","lastName":"Li","id":"37280003300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928889","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":702},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928889","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Proposals","Optimization","Educational institutions","Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computational complexity","minimisation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["egalitarian stable matching","cloud computing","virtual machine migration","migration algorithm","networking problem","deferred acceptance procedure","polynomial time algorithm","total rank sum minimization"]}],"abstract":"Virtual machine migration represents a new challenge to design efficient and practical migration algorithms that work well with hundreds or even thousands of VMs and servers. In our previous work, we advocated the use of a general stable matching framework from economics to solve networking problems, and showed that it offers unique advantages compared to utility-based optimization, using a simple procedure of deferred acceptance. In this paper, we apply this framework to the VM migration problem, and propose an egalitarian approach that finds a stable matching fair to both VMs and servers, instead of favoring either side as a result of the deferred acceptance procedure. Such an egalitarian stable matching that minimizes the total rank sum of the outcome is shown to be a sensible notion of fairness under mild conditions, and through simulations is demonstrated to offer superior results.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928889.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928889","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Egalitarian stable matching for VM migration in cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Egalitarian stable matching for VM migration in cloud computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928889/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928889/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093608","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Egalitarian stable matching for VM migration in cloud computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p631xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062834S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928891,"authors":[{"name":"Ridong Fei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Ridong","lastName":"Fei","id":"37539531700"},{"name":"Kun Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK","School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290845600"},{"name":"Xueqi Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueqi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37273146700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928891","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":875},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Social network services","Delay","Throughput","Vehicles","Mobile communication","Channel allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cooperative communication","mobile radio","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication network","mobile social networks","vehicular social network","social behaviours","network algorithms","dynamic bandwidth allocation","DBA","cooperative network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vehicular social networks","mobile social networks","social centrality","dynamic bandwidth allocation","network cooperation"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates into a special type of network that encourages cooperation between its upper layer social network and lower layer wireless communication network with particular focus on commuters on the road.

This calls for in-depth investigations into the correlation between social behaviours and network algorithms. This paper aims to making some preliminary exploration into this exciting field by investigating into how social centrality, an important concept in social network analysis, makes impact on dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) in a specific scenario of vehicular social networks.

Based on the sensing reports collected on the Cognitive Radio Cloud (CRC) from distributed secondary users (SUs), we study and implement a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm for cooperative SS in TVWS using Microsoft's Windows Azure Cloud platform. A database for the estimated locations and spectrum power profiles of the primary users are established on CRC with Microsoft's SQL Azure. Moreover to enhance the performance of the SBL-based SS on CRC, a hierarchical parallelization method is also implemented with Microsoft's dotNet 4.0 in a MapReduce-like programming model.

The issue of causal ordering has been studied extensively by previous works.

In this paper, we discuss the causal ordering at the network layer.The problem of our concern is: given a group communication request in a CR network, how to set up the connection so that the causal ordering of the group communication can be preserved, and the bandwidth consumption of the communication is minimized. We propose a two-phase method to solve it. In the method, we first construct a multicast tree for the communication, and then assign slots for all tree links. It is proved that the method can preserve the causal ordering of messages without extra communication overhead nor the latency for delivering messages. Simulations are conducted to show the performance of our proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928900","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928900.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928900","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Causal ordering group communication for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Causal ordering group communication for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928900/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093618","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Causal ordering group communication for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p68xie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059173S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5928915,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, USA"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Bai","id":"37669177800"},{"name":"Emeka P.

The ability of using different sampling rates in control systems provides the flexibility for adapting their resource needs based on the dynamic networking environment. This paper studies the dynamic rate adaptation problem for networked control systems. In particular, we define a utility function which quantifies the relationship between the performance of a control system and its sampling rate. Then we formulate the rate adaptation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem, where the aggregated utility is maximized. We further present a price-based algorithm, where prices are generated to reflect the network utilization penalties and are used as the basis for rate adaptation. We formally prove the stability of our algorithm. The rate adaptation algorithm is further evaluated in an integrated simulation environment that consists of Matlab and ns-2, which allows highly accurate evaluation of network effects on the NCS performance. The experiment results show that our algorithm is able to provide agile and stable sampling rate adaptation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Adaptation

for primary users in underlay cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the inevitably induced latency and interference pose new challenges on existing routing schemes for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning. Due to stringent accessing and interference constraints, secondary users appeal to exploit multi-path routing based on multi-hop relaying protocol to support QoS requirements. Via our model, we derive the end-to-end delay statistics including medium access and retransmission delay, where we successfully relate path diversity to end-to-end reliability and optimize the delivery delay by adjusting transmission power. We analyze the performance of the duplication-based and coding-aided multi-path routing schemes, where opportunistic transmission is employed to improve the delivery delay due to channel awareness, and encoding packets on multiple paths further achieves throughput efficiency.

However, considering that wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been deployed to the ISM band, recent researches show that LTE-Advanced needs to provide communication opportunities for WLANs. Such a coexistence relies on applying the cognitive radio technology to LTE-Advanced. However, the cognitive channel access leading to severe channel availability variation obstructs quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees in LTE-Advanced. To alleviate channel availability variation, we adopt a powerful technology known as the network multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and propose the statistical traffic control scheme comprising the packet transmission scheduling and the admission control for LTE-Advanced to tackle critical challenges of the packet transmission coordination and the radio resources allocation in the network MIMO. Simulations results demonstrate an effective support of voice and video transmissions, thus enabling a successful coexistence with WLANs.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928923","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928923.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","startPage":"80","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical traffic control for cognitive radio empowered LTE-Advanced with network MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical traffic control for cognitive radio empowered LTE-Advanced with network MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928923/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093641","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928923/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical traffic control for cognitive radio empowered LTE-Advanced with network MIMO","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p80lien.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065118S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5928944,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Chen","id":"37538818900"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Bin Wang","id":"37696521800"},{"name":"Xiaohang Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37714415900"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xin Zhang","id":"37291970600"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dacheng Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0248-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0249-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5928944","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":909},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Resource management","Aggregates","Throughput","Optimization","Wireless networks","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","quality of service","radio networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["utility-based resource allocation algorithm","mixed traffic","wireless networks","spectrum efficiency","unified utility function","optimization model","heuristic algorithm","QoS requirement","real-time traffic","best effort traffic","quality of service"]}],"abstract":"In order to solve the problem that the existing resource allocation strategies cannot give integrative consideration to QoS, spectrum efficiency for mixed traffic, this paper proposes a utility-based resource allocation algorithm for mixed traffic in wireless networks. The unified utility function for users with different traffics is studied first. After that, the optimization model for the resource allocation is established based on the unified utility function. A heuristic algorithm based on the solution of the model is proposed in the mixed traffic scenario after analyzing the optimization model. The algorithm which has lower complexity than the existing work can automatically guarantee the QoS requirement for the real-time traffic and make a tradeoff between throughput and fairness for users with best effort traffic due to the unified utility function. Numeric simulation results indicate that the algorithm is very applicable for mixed traffic, and the resource requirements for QoS users can be satisfied preferentially in the mixed traffic scenario.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928944","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888675/5928760/05928944.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5928760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility-based resource allocation for mixed traffic in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928944/","displayDocTitle":"Utility-based resource allocation for mixed traffic in wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12093661","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5928944/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-based resource allocation for mixed traffic in wireless networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p91chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0485S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888675","isNumber":"5928760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888675","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5928760","articleId":"5928944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5928970,"authors":[{"name":"Hannes Reinisch","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5928962/5928970/5928970-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hannes Reinisch (S'09) was born in N\u00fcrnberg, Germany, in 1981.

Such systems have the disadvantage that they are not maintenance free because of the limited lifetime of batteries. Instead, wireless sensor nodes or related devices can be remotely powered. To increase the operating range and applicability of these remotely powered devices an electro-magnetic energy harvester iPs developed in a 0.13 \u03bc m low cost CMOS technology. This paper presents an energy harvesting system that converts RF power to DC power to supply wireless sensor nodes, active transmitters or related systems with a power consumption up to the mW range. This energy harvesting system is used to power a wireless sensor node from the 900 MHz RF field. The wireless sensor node includes an on-chip temperature sensor and a bulk acoustic wave (BAW) based transmitter. The BAW resonator reduces the startup time of the transmitter to about 2 \u03bcs which reduces the amount of energy needed in one transmission cycle. The maximum output power of the transmitter is 5.4 dBm. The chip contains an ultra-low-power control unit and consumes only 190 nW in idle mode. The required input power is -19.7 dBm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5928970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","volume":"46","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12073029","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5928970/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Electro-Magnetic Energy Harvesting System With 190 nW Idle Mode Power Consumption for a BAW Based Wireless Sensor Node","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Electro-Magnetic Energy Harvesting System With 190 nW Idle Mode Power Consumption for a BAW Based Wireless Sensor Node","sourcePdf":"jssc-reinisch-2144390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143575S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5928962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5928962","articleId":"5928970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5929124,"authors":[{"name":"Pushparani Bhallamudi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Pushparani","lastName":"Bhallamudi","id":"37596604400"},{"name":"Scott Tilley","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Tilley","id":"37268042000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9493-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9494-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9492-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5929124","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":853},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Service oriented architecture","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Organizations","Testing","Standards","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","failure analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","service-oriented architecture","software maintenance","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOA","lessons learning","service-oriented architecture","enterprise system management","services model","migration approach","failure analysis","evolution process framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SOA","Migration","Case study","Lessons Learned"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929124","abstract":"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a way of designing, developing, deploying, and managing enterprise systems where business needs and technical solutions are closely aligned. SOA offers a number of potential benefits, such as cost-efficiency and agility. To exploit the benefits that SOA offers, several organizations are adopting a services model for leveraging their existing legacy systems. Migration to SOA can give new life to the existing legacy, but if not done correctly the migration can also lead to failure. There are several factors for this, such as technology selection, migration approach, type of legacy system, and SOA governance. One way to learn how to achieve success and avoid failure is through a thorough analysis of existing work in this field. This paper reports on a study that analyzed existing SOA migration projects to learn from them the factors that influence the success or failure of their efforts. A mechanism called the Evolution Process Framework for SOA was used to structure the analysis. Three SOA migration case studies and one experience report were analyzed. Lessons learned from each study are summarized, with crosscutting issues distilled from across all four studies presented.

The main advantage of the proposed system is the large reduction of phase noise or jitter which makes it well suited to operate in noisy environment.

The study considers the use of QPSK (Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying) digital modulation scheme. To achieve reliable coherent detection two different pilot symbols transmission methods are evaluated and compared: data multiplexed pilots and implicit pilots. The method of implicit pilots allows coherent detection at the receiver while avoiding spectral degradation associated with the data multiplexed pilots' technique but results in mutual interference between pilots and data. Since the interference levels between data and pilots might be very high, we propose an iterative receiver.","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929202","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876183/5929030/05929202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929030","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust channel estimation for broadband satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust channel estimation for broadband satellite communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929202/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12075505","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5929202/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust channel estimation for broadband satellite communications","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050532S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876183","isNumber":"5929030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876183","xplore-issue":"5929030","articleId":"5929202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5929203,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Seguro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Seguro","id":"37594871700"},{"name":"Paulo Gomes","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Gomes","id":"37604756700"},{"name":"Nuno Souto","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal","ISCTE-IUL, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Souto","id":"37270173100"},{"name":"Am\u00e9rico Correia","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal","ISCTE-IUL, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Am\u00e9rico","lastName":"Correia","id":"37270174600"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal","FCT-Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7487-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7486-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7485-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5929203","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":171},"abstract":"We consider signal space diversity based on Complex Rotation Matrices (CRM) known to provide good performance gains over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels.

We use an analytical method to derive both the autocorrelation and the cross-correlation of those signals. The resulting expressions are then applied to Maximum-Length (ML) sequences, Gold Codes and TCH (Tomlinson, Cercas, Hughes) sequences.

The lower power consumption is their main great advantage, the higher price being one of the most known disadvantages. Because of the internal structure, CFL have also other disadvantages not such evident, being sources of great electromagnetic fields, both radiated and conducted at the mains port. Also, the ultraviolet radiations should be considered when dealing with them, aspect not covered in this paper. Several tests were done on different types of CFL, from different manufacturers - most of them well known, in order to determine the level of electromagnetic pollution. The electromagnetic radiated field and conducted disturbances level at the mains port were measured, in the frequency range from 80 MHz to 1 GHz and from 150 kHz to 30 MHz, respectively. The resulted values were compared against the limits provided by the CISPR 22 international standard.

For this purpose, an HNN is trained with some sample realization of a specific structure of an analog circuit. Then, considering random initial points, the related HNN converges to spurious local minima of energy function which may be associated with an optimum design of the analog circuit. To demonstrate this idea in practice, a 2.4 GHz fixed-frequency oscillator is considered. The associated design parameters of the oscillator are trained in the weights of an HNN. Starting from random initialization, the HNN provides some design realizations at the convergence state (associated spurious local minima). Some of these design realizations show a better performance in terms of phase noise, power consumption and harmonic distortions.","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929290","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876183/5929030/05929290.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum design of microwave oscillator using Hopfield Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Microwave circuits","Microwave oscillators","Microwave amplifiers","Microwave transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","Hopfield neural nets","microwave oscillators","radiofrequency integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["otimum design","microwave oscillator","Hopfield neural network","analog RF circuits","energy function","fixed-frequency oscillator","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave Circuits","Hopfield","Neural Networks","CAD"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimum design of microwave oscillator using Hopfield Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12075568","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum design of microwave oscillator using Hopfield Neural Network","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0856S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876183","isNumber":"5929030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876183","xplore-issue":"5929030","articleId":"5929290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5929293,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Neag","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Neag","id":"37354213200"},{"name":"Istv\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Istv\u00e1n","lastName":"Kov\u00e1cs","id":"37270568100"},{"name":"Raul Onet","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Raul","lastName":"Onet","id":"37396171000"},{"name":"Marina Topa","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Topa","id":"37396170200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7487-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7486-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7485-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5929293","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Bandwidth","Linearity","Voltage control","Receivers","Noise","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage-controlled amplifier","multistandard OFDM integrated radio receivers","Gm cells","VGA","transconductors","differential current steering scheme","digital controls","CMOS technology","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1 V","capacitance 1 pF","power 7 mW","gain 18 dB","power 12 mW","voltage 1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variable Gain Amplifier","Gm","radio receiver"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a variable-gain amplifier (VGA) based on transconductors (Gm cells); it consists of two instantiations of the same Gm core and three scaled output stages. The core is optimized for high linearity that is not affected by the gain setting as the gain variation is achieved through a differential current steering scheme. The proposed VGA is well suited for multistandard radio receivers: its bandwidth and linearity are largely independent of the gain setting and both the gain range and the bandwidth can be programmed through digital controls. The structure is fully differential, with the output common-mode voltage controlled by a novel scheme, that does not require the placement of additional circuitry in the differential signal path. The VGA was designed in a standard 0.18um CMOS technology; simulation results show that it can cover the gain range of -6dB to +24dB while handling signals with amplitudes up to 1Vpkpkdiff without significant distortions. The bandwidth remains above 40MHz while driving up to 1pF and can be controlled through the programmable capacitance placed at the VGA output. The VGA power consumption is 7mW for gains up to 18dB and 12mW above than, from a 1.8V supply.","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929293","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876183/5929030/05929293.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929030","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A voltage-controlled amplifier based on Gm cells for multistandard OFDM integrated receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A voltage-controlled amplifier based on Gm cells for multistandard OFDM integrated receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929293/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12084430","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5929293/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A voltage-controlled amplifier based on Gm cells for multistandard OFDM integrated receivers","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060379S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876183","isNumber":"5929030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876183","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5929030","articleId":"5929293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5929299,"authors":[{"name":"Tomislav Kartalov","affiliation":["Skopje, Macedonia"],"firstName":"Tomislav","lastName":"Kartalov","id":"37282361800"},{"name":"Zoran Ivanovski","affiliation":["Skopje, Macedonia"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Ivanovski","id":"37297101200"},{"name":"Ljupcho Panovski","affiliation":["Skopje, Macedonia"],"firstName":"Ljupcho","lastName":"Panovski","id":"37297102100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7487-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7486-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7485-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5929299","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Motion compensation","Pixel","Visualization","Real time systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time global motion compensation","multiexposure imaging algorithms","exposure fusion algorithm","mobile platform","high visual quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HDR","Exposure Fusion","Global Motion Compensation","Mobile Applications","Real Time Applications"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a global motion compensation algorithm, designed to work in real time on low memory and low processing power hardware platforms, such as mobile phones.

In particular, we consider the design of transmit and receive filters that minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) between the legitimate parties subject to a certain eavesdropper MSE level, in the situation where the eavesdropper MIMO channel is a degraded version of the main MIMO channel. We analyze the penalty in terms of MSE in the eavesdropper channel due to the assumption that optimal linear receive filters are used, while the eavesdropper employs nonlinear conditional mean estimation instead. This penalty is also shown to be negligible in regions of operational interest. We present a set of numerical results to illustrate the main conclusions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5929337/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12075591","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of filters for reliable and secure communications conditional mean estimation at the eavesdropper","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of filters for reliable and secure communications conditional mean estimation at the eavesdropper","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047656S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876183","isNumber":"5929030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876183","xplore-issue":"5929030","articleId":"5929337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5929352,"authors":[{"name":"Jari Tissari","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Tissari","id":"37391712200"},{"name":"Tero Hurnanen","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Hurnanen","id":"37680177400"},{"name":"Jussi Poikonen","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Poikonen","id":"37287483100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7487-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7486-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7485-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5929352","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitters","Array signal processing","Receivers","Convergence","Bandwidth","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-based system","frequency-selective channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","single-carrier modulation","wideband system","distributed beamforming algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed beamforming","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Earlier publications on distributed beamforming have discussed only single carrier systems.

The BER expressions have also been applied for LTE, giving a tool for the evaluation of LTE physical layer performance in adjacent channel interference scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929378","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876183/5929030/05929378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929030","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General interference analysis of M-QAM transmission applied to LTE performance evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"General interference analysis of M-QAM transmission applied to LTE performance evaluation","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929378/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12084471","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5929378/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General interference analysis of M-QAM transmission applied to LTE performance evaluation","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041064S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876183","isNumber":"5929030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876183","xplore-issue":"5929030","articleId":"5929378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5929380,"authors":[{"name":"Andrej Trost","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Andrej","lastName":"Trost","id":"37373102100"},{"name":"Baldomir Zajc","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Baldomir","lastName":"Zajc","id":"37348486400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7487-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7486-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7485-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5929380","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929380","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Digital systems","IP networks","Registers","Integrated circuit modeling","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer science education","electronic engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic emulator","digital systems education","digital systems design","programmable device","programmable development board","field programmable gate array","user prototyping requirement","user verification requirement","digital circuits education","microoperation based design entry method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Logic emulators","FPGA","IP cores","educational tools"]}],"abstract":"Logic emulators are extensively used for research and educational purpose in the field of digital systems design. Development of programmable devices enabled hardware emulation of complex digital circuits and systems. Comparing to the traditional digital model simulation, the physical implementation of the circuit on the emulator platform enables real application research. There are a lot of commercial programmable development boards available from the vendors of the FPGA devices. They are typically equipped with plenty of peripheral units and designed as stand-alone boards. On the other hand, a custom system can be specifically designed for prototyping and verification requirements of the user, e.g. verification of IP cores for a specific bus. This paper presents a custom programmable logic emulator developed in our laboratory and the design tools used in digital circuits education. The architecture of the emulator is based on two programmable devices with a PC interface. We will present some educational applications of the logic emulator. Students begin with learning the basic digital design principles using traditional tools and a novel micro-operation based design entry method. They are encouraged to study all the details of the programmable board and the design software. Later they are able to implement required course or diploma projects and master the whole design process.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929380","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929380","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876183/5929030/05929380.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic emulators in digital systems education","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Logic emulators in digital systems education","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12075615","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5929380/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic emulators in digital systems education","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053959S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876183","isNumber":"5929030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876183","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5929030","articleId":"5929380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5929405,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Kaminski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Kaminski","id":"38270962600"},{"name":"Czeslaw T.

It can be a part of satellite interactive terminal for digital video broadcasting - return channel via satellite (DVB-RCS) or can be used in a point-to-point backhaul microwave link for mobile telephony. Using complex signals, polyphase filters are analysed so that they can be used as quadrature generators and as complex filters. The upconverter translates a wideband IF signal between 0.95-1.45 GHz to a 29.5-30.0 GHz RF signal using a 14.275 GHz LO along with a frequency doubler. The upconverter makes use of a double-quadrature topology to do single side-band conversion and hence large image rejection can be achieved. By doing so, the expensive off-chip filter can be left out. The upconverter is designed in a 0.25 \u03bcm BiCMOS technology and achieves a power conversion gain of 6.8 dB, IIP3 of 17.85 dBm and image rejection of 60 dB over the RF image bandwidth. The performance has been verified using SpectreRF simulations. Mismatch is kept within limits and is supported by Monte-Carlo simulation.","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929421","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a

It is found that a stable region in power transfer efficiency (PTE) can be created for sufficiently close spacing between two transmitters, in contrast to the monotonic decay of the single-transmitter case. We next demonstrate through simulation and measurement that such a bound can be approached by using efficient, electrically small, folded cylindrical helix dipoles. The measurement shows a 17% PTE value over a 0.3\u03bb region between the two transmitters, corroborating the theory and simulation. Results from the four-transmitter case show that the stable PTE region can be extended to two-dimensional space.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5730210/05929487.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2160518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2160518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Near-Field Wireless Power Transfer Under Multiple Transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Dipole antennas","Antenna measurements","Receiving antennas","Helical antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-field wireless power transfer","multiple transmitters","upper bound","near-field region","multiple-transmitter scenario","power transfer efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrically small antennas","near field","power transfer efficiency (PTE)","transmitter diversity","wireless power transfer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Near-Field Wireless Power Transfer Under Multiple Transmitters","volume":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5929487/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2011","accessionNumber":"12092018","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Near-Field Wireless Power Transfer Under Multiple Transmitters","sourcePdf":"lawp-yoon-2160518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070944S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"5929487","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5929488,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Chi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Chi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37693440600"},{"name":"Yi-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279539200"},{"name":"Wen-Yueh Jang","affiliation":["Winbond Electronics Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Yueh","lastName":"Jang","id":"37415956000"},{"name":"Chen-Hsi Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Hsi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37366149600"},{"name":"Tseung-Yuen Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tseung-Yuen","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37287702900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5929488","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2252},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"The Ti/ZrO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n/Pt resistive memory devices with one transistor and one resistor (1T1R) architecture are successfully fabricated in this letter.

One distinct advantage of the proposed controller lies in that its implementation only requires a simple second-order model of the system, whereas it does not need to know neither the hysteresis model nor the bounds on system uncertainties. The unmodeled hysteresis is eliminated by the one-step delayed disturbance estimation technique and the neglected residual modes are suppressed by employing a properly-designed state observer. Moreover, the reasons why the model predictive control methodology and PI action can eliminate the chattering effects and produce a low level of tracking error are discovered in state-space framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed MPDSMC controller is superior to both conventional PID and DSMC methods in motion tracking tasks. A precise tracking is achieved by the nanopositioning stage along with the hysteretic nonlinearity mitigated to a negligible level, which validates the feasibility of the proposed controller in the domain of micro-/nanomanipulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Control of a Nanopositioning Piezostage Without Modeling Hysteresis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2157345","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6203515/05929495.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2157345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6203515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Control of a Nanopositioning Piezostage Without Modeling Hysteresis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5929495/","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12853062","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Control of a Nanopositioning Piezostage Without Modeling Hysteresis","sourcePdf":"tcst-li-2157345-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100489S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6203515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6203515","articleId":"5929495","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5929499,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Richardson","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic, and Mechanical Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6133486/5929499/5929499-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Richardson (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are in electric vehicles, distributed energy resources, and distribution networks."]},"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Richardson","id":"37389938300"},{"name":"Damian Flynn","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic, and Mechanical Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6133486/5929499/5929499-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Damian Flynn (M'96) is a senior lecturer in power engineering at University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.

However, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles could lead to adverse effects on the power system, especially for existing distribution networks. These effects would include excessive voltage drops and overloading of network components, which occur mainly during periods of simultaneous charging of large numbers of electric vehicles. This paper demonstrates how controlling the rate at which electric vehicles charge can lead to better utilization of existing networks. A technique based on linear programming is employed, which determines the optimal charging rate for each electric vehicle in order to maximize the total power that can be delivered to the vehicles while operating within network limits. The technique is tested on a section of residential distribution network. Results show that, by controlling the charging rate of individual vehicles, high penetrations can be accommodated on existing residential networks with little or no need for upgrading network infrastructure.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2158247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/05929499.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2158247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","startPage":"268","endPage":"279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Charging of Electric Vehicles in Low-Voltage Distribution Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Charging of Electric Vehicles in Low-Voltage Distribution Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929499/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12479019","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5929499/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Charging of Electric Vehicles in Low-Voltage Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-richardson-2158247-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0726S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"359","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"5929499","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5929500,"authors":[{"name":"Sohan Purohit","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sohan","lastName":"Purohit","id":"37531960000"},{"name":"Martin Margala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Margala","id":"37271535300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5929500","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2384},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Voltage control","Delay","Logic gates","Transistors","Very large scale integration","Logic functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","logic circuits","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit implementation","full-adder circuits","IBM process","split-path data driven dynamic logic","logic function","power consumption","fan-out loads","propagation delays","Monte Carlo simulations","size 90 nm","word length 32 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full adders","Monte Carlo analysis","multipliers","process-voltage variations"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design and characterization of 12 full-adder circuits in the IBM 90-nm process.

However, the adaptive interpolation filtering has a limitation in coding efficiency because of its frame-based update strategy of filter coefficients. Although switched interpolation filter with offset is presented as a sort of block-adaptive filtering for KTA codec, its coding efficiency is generally lower than that of the best adaptive interpolation filter. In order to overcome such a problem, this paper presents an advanced block-adaptive interpolation filtering using well-trained dictionaries which store optimized filter coefficients. We derive those filter coefficients by using learning-based super-resolution. The proposed block-adaptive interpolation filtering for quarter-pel motion compensation consists of two steps: up-scaling of half-pel accuracy and subsequent up-scaling of quarter-pel accuracy. The dictionary optimized for each step is employed to produce the precise up-scaled pixels. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves higher coding efficiency than the previous adaptive interpolation filters for KTA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6145208/05929545.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2160601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2160601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Adaptive Interpolation Filter Using Trained Dictionary for Sub-Pixel Motion Compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Dictionaries","Wiener filter","Motion compensation","Pixel","Encoding","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","image resolution","interpolation","learning (artificial intelligence)","motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block adaptive interpolation filter","sub-pixel motion compensation","sub-pel motion compensation","key techniques","ITU-T key technology area","KTA codec","coding efficiency","frame-based update strategy","switched interpolation filter","block-adaptive filtering","advanced block-adaptive interpolation filtering","well-trained dictionary","optimized filter coefficients","learning-based super-resolution","quarter-pel motion compensation","half-pel accuracy","quarter-pel accuracy","up-scaled pixels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive interpolation filter","sub-pel motion compensation","super-resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Block Adaptive Interpolation Filter Using Trained Dictionary for Sub-Pixel Motion Compensation","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5929545/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12524314","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Adaptive Interpolation Filter Using Trained Dictionary for Sub-Pixel Motion Compensation","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-song-2160601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081552S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6145208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","xplore-issue":"6145208","articleId":"5929545","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5929550,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Massimiliano Capisani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Systems Science, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6175217/5929550/5929550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Massimiliano Capisani (M'06) gained in 2001 the \u201cdiploma in Commercial and Computer Science.\u201d His diploma has been awarded by the young Industrial Association of Mantua.

The friction behavior is described by a nonlinear dynamical model. Since it is difficult to know the nonlinear parts in the frictional model accurately, two neural networks (NNs) are employed in the proposed intelligent controller.

Since the precise model of the VCM is difficult to obtain, a model-free intelligent control system is developed for the precise trajectory tracking of VCMs. This control system comprises a wavelet fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) (WFCMAC) and a fuzzy compensator. The novel WFCMAC incorporates the wavelet decomposition property with a fuzzy CMAC fast learning ability, and it is used to imitate an ideal controller. This WFCMAC is a generalization network. In some special cases, it can be reduced to a fuzzy neural network (NN), a wavelet NN, and a CMAC. Moreover, the fuzzy compensator is developed to attenuate the effect of the approximation error caused by the WFCMAC approximator. The online learning algorithm of the controller's parameters is derived based on the Lyapunov function; thus, the stability of the system can be guaranteed. Finally, the developed control system is applied to the trajectory tracking control of a VCM. From the experimental results, it is verified that the proposed WFCMAC control scheme can achieve favorable tracking performance even if the system model of the VCM is unknown. Furthermore, the salient merits are also indicated in comparison with a proportional-integral-derivative controller.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2160139","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6063570/05929554.pdf","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2160139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Adaptive Wavelet Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Control System Design for Voice Coil Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Adaptive Wavelet Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Control System Design for Voice Coil Motors","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12328302","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5929554/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Adaptive Wavelet Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Control System Design for Voice Coil Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-lin-2160139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07298S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6063570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6063570","articleId":"5929554","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5929557,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Zhang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6046172/5929557/5929557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Zhang received the B.S. degree in automation from the Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China, in 2010.","Since July 2010, he has been with Shenyang E-SUN Technology Company, Ltd., Shenyang.

It is often estimated using a Kalman filter (KF) under the assumption that the statistical properties of the system and measurement errors are known.

In this paper, without the requirement of the known statistical properties, a SOC estimation method is proposed using an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n observer, which can still guarantee the SOC estimation accuracy in the worst statistical error case. Under the conditions of different currents and temperatures, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in the laboratory and field environments. With the comparison of the proposed method and the KF-based one, the experimental results show that the proposed method can still provide accurate SOC estimation when there exist inexact or unknown statistical properties of the errors. The proposed method has been applied successfully to the robot for inspecting the running 500-kV extra high voltage power transmission lines.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2159691","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1095","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6046172/05929557.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2159691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Battery State of Charge With - Observer: Applied to a Robot for Inspecting Power Transmission Lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","System-on-a-chip","Observers","Robots","Capacitors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H\u221e control","inspection","Kalman filters","mobile robots","observers","power filters","power transmission lines","secondary cells","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery state of charge estimation","H\u221e observer","power transmission line inspection","mobile robot","Kalman filter","statistical property","measurement errors","SOC estimation error","voltage 500 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery","$H_{\\infty}$ observer","inspection robot","Kalman filter (KF)","power transmission lines","state of charge (SOC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929557/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Battery State of Charge With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$H_{\\infty}$ </tex></formula> Observer: Applied to a Robot for Inspecting Power Transmission Lines","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5929557/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12300516","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Battery State of Charge With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$H_{\\infty}$ </tex></formula> Observer: Applied to a Robot for Inspecting Power Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2159691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060371S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6046172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6046172","articleId":"5929557","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5929562,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiwu Cao","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Dearborn, MI, USA","School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Ruiwu Cao (S'10) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1980.

This paper proposes a new LDSPM motor design with complementary and modular structure. The key of this structure is that the primary mover is composed of two modules whose positions are mutually four and one half of the stator pole pitch apart and there is a flux barrier between them. Hence, the back electromotive force (EMF) waveform and cogging force of the two modules have 180 electrical degree differences. This design results in the total cogging force being significantly reduced and the back-EMF of each phase becoming symmetrical because the even harmonics are canceled. For fair comparison, an existing linear LDSPM motor is designed based on the same electromagnetic parameters and compared by the means of finite element analysis (FEA). The results reveal that the proposed LDSPM motor can offer symmetrical back-EMF waveforms, smaller cogging force, lower force ripple, and higher magnet utilization factor than the existing one.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Permanent magnet motors","Coils","Stator windings","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric potential","finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear doubly salient permanent magnet motor","modular structure","complementary structure","LDSPM motor design","stator","electromotive force waveform","cogging force","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double salient motor","finite-element method","linear motor","permanent magnet (PM) motor"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2160554","startPage":"4809","endPage":"4821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6084874/05929562.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2160554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Linear Doubly Salient Permanent-Magnet Motor With Modular and Complementary Structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Linear Doubly Salient Permanent-Magnet Motor With Modular and Complementary Structure","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12376438","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","volume":"47","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929562/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linear Doubly Salient Permanent-Magnet Motor With Modular and Complementary Structure","sourcePdf":"tmag-cheng-2160554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07787S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6084874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6084874","articleId":"5929562","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5929570,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri V.

The approach includes three steps: forecast data acquisition, statistical analysis of retrospective information, and prediction of grid balancing requirements for a specified time horizon and a given confidence level. An assessment of the capacity and ramping requirements is performed using a specially developed probabilistic algorithm based on histogram analysis, capable of incorporating multiple sources of uncertainty - both continuous (wind and load forecast errors) and discrete (forced generator outages and startup failures). A new method called the \u201cflying-brick\u201d technique is developed to evaluate the look-ahead required generation performance envelope for the worst-case scenario within a user-specified confidence level. A self-validation process is used to validate the accuracy of the confidence intervals. To demonstrate the validity of the developed uncertainty assessment methods and its impact on grid operation, a framework for integrating the proposed methods with an energy management system (EMS) is developed. Demonstration through EMS integration illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology and the developed tool for actual grid operation and paves the road for integration with EMS systems in control rooms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12230397","volume":"2","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5929570/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Uncertainty of Wind Power Generation Forecast Into Power System Operation, Dispatch, and Unit Commitment Procedures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating Uncertainty of Wind Power Generation Forecast Into Power System Operation, Dispatch, and Unit Commitment Procedures","sourcePdf":"tste-ma-2159254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048663S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"6021408","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6021408","articleId":"5929570","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":5929590,"authors":[{"name":"Y\u0131lmaz Kalkan","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Y\u0131lmaz","lastName":"Kalkan","id":"37064577100"},{"name":"Buyurman Baykal","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, S\u00fcleyman Demirel \u00dcniversitesi, Isparta, Turkey"],"firstName":"Buyurman","lastName":"Baykal","id":"37271393500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0463-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0461-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5929590","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","MIMO","Doppler radar","Conferences","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","direction-of-arrival estimation","Doppler measurement","Doppler shift","MIMO radar","search problems","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency based target localization methods","time of arrival","angle of arrival","frequency of arrival","TOA","unmodulated CW radar","frequency resolution","time resolution","nonmaneuvering target","Doppler-shift measurements","MIMO radar systems","grid searching"]}],"abstract":"A new frequency based target localization method is proposed for MIMO radars which are widely separated.

Although, chaotic circuit outputs track similar traces for the defined parameters, still the circuit outputs preserve their own random characteristics at each trial. PNN is an effective tool for classification of pattern recognition problems. Inherited features of PNN are very compatible with the chaotic circuit output classification problem and it provides satisfying performance. The selection of the proper features in the feature extraction step defines the performance of the classification significantly.

In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate algorithm for classifying of right/left hand movement imagery electroencephalogram data. The algorithm is presented in three basic steps. In the first step, an unit variance normalization is implemented to electroencephalogram data as preprocessing. In the second step, features are extracted from signals by using Fourier Transform algorithm. In the last step, the features are classified by using the Support Vector Machines, the k-Nearest Neighbor and Linear Discriminant Analysis. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to the BCI competition 2003 data set which is named as Data Set III, and achieved a classification accuracy of 91.4 % on test set.

The first problem to be solved by a Cognitive Radio terminal is sensing the signals of the licensed users. In our study, we offer a new sensing method based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of received signals. The method defines a test statistic on the distribution of eigenvalues to give a \u201cYes or No\u201d decision about the signals in the band-of-interest. The main idea behind the method is that eigenvalues belonging to the noise subspace of the covariance matrix tend to exhibit a linear trend of decrease in case of limited number of samples of the received signals. The proposed method presents a realistic approach, and due to its robustness to sensing without suffering from noise power uncertainty, it has advantages against the energy level comparison based detectors that are highly influenced by the noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929695/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12075212","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929695/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Signal detection based on linear trend in the noise-originated eigenvalues of the correlation matrix for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal detection based on linear trend in the noise-originated eigenvalues of the correlation matrix for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054302S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5873567","isNumber":"5929571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5873567","xplore-issue":"5929571","articleId":"5929695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5929698,"authors":[{"name":"Ilhan Ba\u015ft\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130zmir Y\u00fciksek Teknoloji Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilhan","lastName":"Ba\u015ft\u00fcrk","id":"38190455000"},{"name":"Berna \u00d6zbek","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130zmir Y\u00fciksek Teknoloji Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, Turkey"],"firstName":"Berna","lastName":"\u00d6zbek","id":"37269362900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0463-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0461-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5929698","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Bit error rate","Conferences","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Downlink","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fair resource allocation","multiuser MISO-OFDMA systems","multiple-input single-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","transmitter antennas","base stations","Shannon capacity","bit error rate","fairness index","BER","user selection"]}],"abstract":"In this study, the user selection at the base station and resource allocation algorithms are presented for multiuser multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MU-MISO OFDMA) systems when the number of users in a cell is much more than the number of transmitter antennas.

In our system model, we concentrate on single beam opportunistic communication and propose a novel MAC protocol that can perform multiuser diversity gain based on effective SNR (ESNR) metric with the aid of selection combining technique. Packet transfer from sensor nodes to control node is initiated when the channel quality of any node exceeds the predefined threshold. In order to maximize the system performance, we find an optimum threshold for packet transmission decision of sensor nodes. The problem of finding the optimum threshold is formulated using the probability of successful packet reception at the control node. The performance of the suggested MAC protocol is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations for Rayleigh slow fading channel model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5873567/5929571/05929741.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"681","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2011.5929741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2011.5929741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An opportunistic packet transmission scheme for MIMO based wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Conferences","Fading","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","antenna arrays","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","Rayleigh channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic packet transmission","MIMO","wireless sensor networks","single hop architecture","central control node","multiple antennas","MAC protocol","packet transmission decision","Monte Carlo simulations","Rayleigh slow fading channel model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"An opportunistic packet transmission scheme for MIMO based wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12075258","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An opportunistic packet transmission scheme for MIMO based wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049964S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5873567","isNumber":"5929571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5873567","xplore-issue":"5929571","articleId":"5929741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5929750,"authors":[{"name":"Beg\u00fcm Korunur Engiz","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Ondokuz May\u0131s \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Beg\u00fcm Korunur","lastName":"Engiz","id":"38229921100"},{"name":"\u00c7etin Kurnaz","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Ondokuz May\u0131s \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00c7etin","lastName":"Kurnaz","id":"37688558100"},{"name":"Hatice Sezgin","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Ondokuz May\u0131s \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hatice","lastName":"Sezgin","id":"37992023200"},{"name":"H\u00fclya G\u00f6kalp","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Ondokuz May\u0131s \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"H\u00fclya","lastName":"G\u00f6kalp","id":"37329528700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0463-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0461-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5929750","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Conferences","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interpolation","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot bit arrangement","OFDM system performance","comb-type-based channel estimator","computer simulations","least squares algorithm","low-pass interpolation","data subcarriers","pilot subcarriers","bit error rate","optimum pilot ratio","OPR","channel coherence bandwidths","frequency selectivity","spectrum efficiency","channel estimation accuracy"]}],"abstract":"In this study, the effect of pilot bit placement on the performance of an OFDM system with comb-type based channel estimator was investigated.

The pilot ratio (ratio of data bits to pilot bits) that gave the lowest bit error rate was determined as the Optimum Pilot Ratio (OPR) and spacing between the pilot sub-carriers as (\u0394f)\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OPR</sub>\n. Then the relationship between (\u0394f)\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OPR</sub>\n and channels' coherence bandwidths was investigated using four channels with different frequency selectivity. Simulation results show that, taking spectrum efficiency and channel estimation accuracy into account, two or three pilot subcarrier within coherence bandwidth at 0.9 correlation is likely to be an optimum choice.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating the effect of pilot bit arragement on OFDM system performance","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2011.5929750","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5873567/5929571/05929750.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2011.5929750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Investigating the effect of pilot bit arragement on OFDM system performance","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929750/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12075267","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating the effect of pilot bit arragement on OFDM system performance","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087211S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5873567","isNumber":"5929571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5873567","xplore-issue":"5929571","articleId":"5929750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5929760,"authors":[{"name":"Merve Abide Demir","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, DSP Laboratory, Karadeniz Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Merve Abide","lastName":"Demir","id":"37903472000"},{"name":"Ali \u00d6zen","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, DSP Laboratory, Karadeniz Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"\u00d6zen","id":"37892140300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0463-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0461-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5929760","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929760","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary phase shift keying","Decision feedback equalizers","Least squares approximation","WiMAX","Signal processing algorithms","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","decision feedback equalisers","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable step-size soft-decision feedback blind equalizer","error propagation","DFE","variable step-size adjustment method","blind equalization technique","constant modulus algorithm","WiMax standard","IEEE 802.16-2004","VSS-CMA algorithm","normalized CMA algorithm","N-CMA algorithm","frequency 3.5 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIU.2011.5929760","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5873567/5929571/05929760.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2011.5929760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel variable step size soft decision feedback blind equalizer","abstract":"The use of soft decisions to mitigate error propagation in a conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is considered for application to blind equalization in this paper.

However, a widely recognized nonlinear distortion due to the nonlinear power amplifiers reduces the efficiency of the SFBC-OFDM transmission and limits further network deployment. In this paper, we propose the strategy based on using the well-known tone reservation (TR) technique that was initially proposed to be used in conventional single antenna OFDM systems. However, in OFDM systems TR sacrifices a set of subcarrier prior to the transmission in order to reduce the signal envelope fluctuation, thereby reducing the data rate of the transmission. Here, we propose to use the zero tones introduced during the procedure of SFBC encoding using selected orthogonal design instead of reserving the set of subcarriers, which allows for achieving practically full data rate of the transmission. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the out-of-band radiation to the adjacent channels and therefore improve the overall performance of the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tone reservation for SFBC-OFDM transmission systems using null subcarriers","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2011.5929874","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5873567/5929571/05929874.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2011.5929874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Tone reservation for SFBC-OFDM transmission systems using null subcarriers","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929874/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12075389","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tone reservation for SFBC-OFDM transmission systems using null subcarriers","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059074S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5873567","isNumber":"5929571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5873567","xplore-issue":"5929571","articleId":"5929874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5929968,"authors":[{"name":"Sundeep Lal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sundeep","lastName":"Lal","id":"37708817300"},{"name":"Roberto Muscedere","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Muscedere","id":"37294787800"},{"name":"Sazzadur Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sazzadur","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37269503700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0660-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0658-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0659-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"}],"articleNumber":"5929968","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1134},"abstract":"An FPGA implemented signal processing algorithm to determine the range and velocity of targets using a MEMS based tri-mode 77 GHz FMCW automotive radar has been presented.

The monitor collects serial communications from two separate Controller Area Networks (CAN) within the prosthetic limb's embedded system. The information collected can be used by researchers to optimize performance and monitor patient use. The data monitor is designed with an understanding of the constraints inherent in both the prosthesis industry and embedded systems technologies. The design uses a number of verilog logic cores which compartmentalize individual logic areas allowing for more successful validation and verification through both simulations and practical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2011.5929972","publicationTitle":"2011 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888815/5929963/05929972.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2011.5929972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA design for monitoring CANbus traffic in a prosthetic limb sensor network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929972/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA design for monitoring CANbus traffic in a prosthetic limb sensor network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075926","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929972/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA design for monitoring CANbus traffic in a prosthetic limb sensor network","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"p05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066919S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888815","isNumber":"5929963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888815","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5929963","articleId":"5929972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5929976,"authors":[{"name":"Taha Beyrouthy","affiliation":["Concurrent Integrated Systems Group, TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Taha","lastName":"Beyrouthy","id":"37402270600"},{"name":"Laurent Fesquet","affiliation":["Concurrent Integrated Systems Group, TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Fesquet","id":"37295549700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0660-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0658-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0659-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"}],"articleNumber":"5929976","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"abstract":"Non-uniform sampling has proven through different works, to be a better scheme than the uniform sampling to sample low activity signals. With such signals, it generates fewer samples, which means less data to process and lower power consumption. In addition, it is well-known that asynchronous logic is a low power technology. This paper deals with the coupling between a non-uniform sampling scheme and an asynchronous design in order to implement a digital Filter. This paper presents the first design of a micropipeline asynchronous FIR filter architecture coupled to a non-uniform sampling scheme. The implementation has been done on an Altera FPGA board.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An event-driven FIR filter: Design and implementation","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2011.5929976","endPage":"65","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888815/5929963/05929976.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","startPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2011.5929976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929963","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5929976","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Computer architecture","Protocols","Convolution","Logic gates","Synchronization","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven FIR filter","asynchronous logic","asynchronous design","micropipeline asynchronous FIR filter","nonuniform sampling","Altera FPGA board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous logic","non-uniform sampling","FIR filter","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An event-driven FIR filter: Design and implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5929976/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12075930","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An event-driven FIR filter: Design and implementation","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"p09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056939S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888815","isNumber":"5929963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888815","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5929963","articleId":"5929976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5929989,"authors":[{"name":"Mouna Baklouti","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe UMR 8022, CNRS, University of Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Mouna","lastName":"Baklouti","id":"37320398400"},{"name":"Manel Ammar","affiliation":["CES Laboratory, ENIS School, University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Ammar","id":"37709486500"},{"name":"Philippe Marquet","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe UMR 8022, CNRS, University of Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Marquet","id":"37320392700"},{"name":"Mohamed Abid","affiliation":["CES Laboratory, ENIS School, University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Abid","id":"37299902600"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Dekeyser","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe UMR 8022, CNRS, University of Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Dekeyser","id":"37282782900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0660-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0658-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0659-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"}],"articleNumber":"5929989","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"abstract":"Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) based approaches have been proposed as a solution to cope with the inefficiency of current design methods. In this context, this paper presents an MDE-based framework for rapid SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) parametric parallel SoC (System-on-Chip) prototyping to deal with the ever-growing complexity of such embedded systems design process. The design flow covers the design phases from system-level modeling to FPGA prototyping. The proposed framework allows the designer to easily and automatically generate a VHDL parallel SoC configuration from a high-level system specification model using the MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems) standard profile. It is based on an IP (Intellectual Property) library and a basic parallel SoC model. The generated parallel configuration can be adapted to the data-parallel application requirements. In an experimental setting, four steps are needed to generate a parallel SoC: data-parallel programming, SoC modeling, deployment and generation process. Experimental results for a video application validate the approach and demonstrate that the proposed framework facilitates the parallel SoC exploration.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

This problem can be alleviated by an advanced driver generation environment. We have achieved this by systematically synthesizing drivers from a device features model and specifications of hardware and in-kernel interfaces, thereby lessening the impact of human error on driver reliability and reducing the development costs. We present the methodology called Me3D and confirm the feasibility of the driver generation environment by manually converting sources of information captured in different formalisms to a Multimedia Card Interface (MCI) driver for a real MPSoC under a lightweight operating system (OS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5929992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5929992/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075946","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Me3D: A model-driven methodology expediting embedded device driver development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Me3D: A model-driven methodology expediting embedded device driver development","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"p25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090282S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888815","isNumber":"5929963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888815","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5929963","articleId":"5929992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
