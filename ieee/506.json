The base points for this plot On the complex plane are the zeros and poles of the open loop transfer function, which are readily available. The locus of roots is a plot of the values of s which make this transfer function equal to - 1 as loop gain is increased from zero to infinity. The plot can be established in approximate form by inspection and the significant parts of the locus calculated accurately and quickly by use of a simple device. For multiple loop systems, one solves the innermost loop first, which then permits the next loop to be solved by another root locus plot. The resultant plot gives a complete picture of the system, which is particularly valuable for unusual systems or those which have wide variations in parameters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5060108","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5060108/05060121.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1950.5060121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1950.5060121","startPage":"66","endPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control System Synthesis by Root Locus Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1950","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1950","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5060121/","displayDocTitle":"Control System Synthesis by Root Locus Method","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 1950","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control System Synthesis by Root Locus Method","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v69-n1-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039868S","chronDate":"Jan.  1950","isNumber":"5060108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"80","articleId":"5060121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1950","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5060143,"authors":[{"name":"Lee A.

The present paper deals with the two copper wires on the line of poles, for they constitute the wave antenna which has not only marked a distinct advance in the reduction of interference and ''static,'' but because of its aperiodic nature and effectiveness as an energy collector, has made possible the sumultaneous reception of a large number of messages by one antenna, and the automatic relaying of the messages over land wires. The use of two wires is not an essential feature of the wave antenna but permits flexibility in the location of the receiving station. In its elementary form the wave antenna consists of a straight horizontal conductor.

Among the transient phenomena that occur along transmission lines, these are still little known, especially as far as their ``attenuation'' and ``distortion,'' or change in shape near the ``wave front'' are concerned. It is first seen that the ``classical theory'' of the propagation of electrical disturbances along lines, as it has been chiefly developed by Heaviside and Poincare, does not give a correct representation of the facts near the wave front, because it assumes an instantaneous penetration, of the current in the wires. It is shown that this theory is an ``unidimensional'' one, as it considers only one space variable, the coordinate along the line, and, from an electromagnetic point of view, amounts to identifying the traveling waves with plane wave phenomena. Steinmetz's theory of the radiation from traveling waves (TRANS. A. I. E. E. Feb., 1919) is then examined, and, as Carson pointed out (JOUR. A. I. E. E., Oct. 1921), found based on a misconception of the propagation of the electromagnetic field near the wires of a line. It is remarked that this theory amounts to propagating longitudinal electric waves, a conception in conflict with the basis of Maxwell's theory. This latter proves very easily that, along a perfect line, i. e., without ohmic or leakage losses, plane electromagnetic traveling waves are propagated without distortion and without attenuation; hence that there is no radiation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation from Transmission Lines","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1923.5060873","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5060849/05060873.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1923.5060873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5060849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5060873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5060873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January-December  1923","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-December  1923","displayDocTitle":"Radiation from Transmission Lines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"XLII","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"January-December 1923","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation from Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXLII-n0-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021709S","chronDate":"January-December  1923","isNumber":"5060849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5060873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1923","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5060903,"authors":[{"name":"George E.

This limitation found in the heating, is primarily due to the effects of high temperatures on the various types of insulation used in such machines. The American Institute of Electrical Engineers Standards specify the maximum permissible operating temperatures for the various grades of insulation. The temperature of the windings in the machines then, must be kept below this maximum permissible temperature. The heat losses produced in a machine are the results of electrical and mechanical losses. These losses must be transferred from the source of generation to the cooling medium. The first step of the heat flow path is by conduction through the copper, iron or insulation to the ventilating or cooling surfaces. The second step in the transfer of the heat may be called the liberation or dissipation of the heat from these surfaces to the cooling medium. This portion of the heat flow may be divided into two or more stages by the use of an intermediate cooling medium, such as oil, in an oil-insulated transformer. This paper deals with some of the more common types of ventilating and cooling systems used in the electric machines and particularly with the laws governing the flow of heat from the cooling surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1923.5060903","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5060849/05060903.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1923.5060903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5060849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Cooling of Electric Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5060903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January-December  1923","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-December  1923","displayDocTitle":"The Cooling of Electric Machines","volume":"XLII","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January-December 1923","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Cooling of Electric Machines","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXLII-n0-54.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037215S","chronDate":"January-December  1923","isNumber":"5060849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"31","articleId":"5060903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1923","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5060915,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Applying the same method of reasoning used in the case of sectionalizing to the general case of any machine with segmental punchings, the following facts are shown: 1. A principal cause of shaft currents in revolving electric machines is the use of poles and segments in certain ratios. 2. The frequency of the shaft current due to joints in the stator yoke is an odd mnultiple of the frequency of the stator flux, the frequency of the shaft currents due to rotor joints is an odd multiple of the rotor frequency, and these frequency multiples are determined by the ratios of poles to segments. 3. Machines with 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, etc., poles are especially likely to have shaft currents, and machines with 6, 10, 14, 22, etc., poles are relatively immune. 4.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shaft Currents in Electric Machines","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1924.5060981","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5060960/05060981.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1924.5060981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5060960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5060981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5060981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January-December  1924","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-December  1924","displayDocTitle":"Shaft Currents in Electric Machines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"XLIII","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"January-December 1924","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shaft Currents in Electric Machines","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXLIII-n0-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033013S","chronDate":"January-December  1924","isNumber":"5060960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"61","articleId":"5060981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1924","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5060996,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this paper the following two fundamentally important factors in connection with this problem are given principal attention: 1. Signal shaping, i. e., giving signals the best wave shape before impressing them on the transmitting medium so as to be able to send signal elements at maximum speed without undue interference into other circuits. 2. Choice of codes so as to transmit the maximum amount of intelligence with a given number of signal elements. These factors are discussed with the idea of indicating the best methods, as well as to give an idea of what may be expected from these methods. In connection with the choice of codes, consideration is given to the effect of codes differing in the number of ``currentt values'' employed. By this is meant the number of different current values which are employed in a system in forming the different characters.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1924.5060996","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5060960/05060996.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1924.5060996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5060960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January-December  1924","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5060996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-December  1924","displayDocTitle":"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","volume":"XLIII","publicationDate":"January-December 1924","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXLIII-n0-36.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03901S","chronDate":"January-December  1924","isNumber":"5060960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"59","articleId":"5060996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1924","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5061047,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The application of reactors to different circuits is not treated because a number of good papers dealing with this subject has been presented at Institute meetings. Design.-A current-limiting reactor should have low reactance at low currents and high reactance at high currents. Such a reactor has been developed and is known as the ``saturated core'' reactor. It has not been used as yet for current-limiting protection to any extent. A reactor having an iron core and only an a-c. winding gives a drooping voltage-ampere characteristic and, therefore is not suitable for current-limiting protection. Reactors with air cores have straight line volt-ampere characteristics and, therefore, are well adapted for this protection. Since the only function of current-limiting reactors is to limit the current during short circuits to safe values, they should be capable of performing this function when other apparatus is being destroyed, due to excessive current. For this reason, heat resisting materials should be used for holding and insulating the conductor of a reactor. A useful formula is given for determining short-circuit temperature rises. A current-limiting reactor functions as such only when there are short circuits on the system. Short circuits are almost sure to be preceded or accompanied by voltage disturbances of abnormal value. Therefore, the insulation factor of safety in a reactor should be relatively high.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January-December  1924","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-December  1924","publicationDate":"January-December 1924","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","volume":"XLIII","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Current-Limiting Reactors Their Design, Installation and Operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-Limiting Reactors Their Design, Installation and Operation","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXLIII-n0-87.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041754S","chronDate":"January-December  1924","isNumber":"5060960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5061047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1924","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5061210,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The authors have called attention to the great value of the mathmatical work by the German engineer, Rogowski, and the graphical methods by the French engineer, Lehmann. These German and French articles contain the only extensive practical applications of the plotting of magnetic fields in current-carrying regions with which the present authors are familiar.

A 240 pole synchronous motor of the variable reluctance type is used as a basis. Coupled to it a direct curent motor carries the steady component of the load. Hunting is eliminated by a condenser in series with the two synchronous motors whose capacitance is slightly less than that required to tune the circuit. As the motor might lock into step in any of 120 possible angular positions, only one of which would give the proper phase relations, a two-pole motor, with only one locking position, was provided by tapping the armature of the direct current motor at two points and bringing out the leads to slip rings. This was used for synchronizing while the 240 pole motor, connected subsequently, held the close synchronism required. The disks rotate at 1062.5 rev. per min. which gives 17.7 cycles on the two-pole and 2125 cycles on the 240-pole motor. For transmission the synchronizing current is attenuated to a level of 0.6 milliwatt and amplified at the receiving end. The 17.7-cycle current is an undesirably low frequency for transmission over telephone cables and so is used to modulate a 760-cycle current through a polarized relay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization af Television","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1927.5061434","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5061332/05061434.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1927.5061434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January-December  1927","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-December  1927","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization af Television","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"XLVI","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"January-December 1927","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization af Television","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXLVI-n0-102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022257S","chronDate":"January-December  1927","isNumber":"5061332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5061434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1927","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5061485,"authors":[{"name":"Ren-Jie Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5170177/5061485/5061485-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ren-Jie Lee (S'07) received the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan, in 2000.

As a result, the iterative interface design has been a time-consuming process. This paper proposes a novel and efficient approach to designating pin-out, which is a package ball chart describing pin locations for flip-chip BGA package when designing chipsets. The proposed approach can not only automate the assignment of more than 200 input/output (I/O) pins on package, but also precisely evaluate package size which accommodates all pins with almost no void pin positions, as good as the one from manual design. Furthermore, the practical experience and techniques in designing such interface has been accounted for, including signal integrity, power delivery and routability. This efficient pin-out designation and package size estimation by pin-block design and floorplanning provides much faster turn around time, thus enormous improvement in meeting design schedule. Our pin-block design contains two major parts. First, we have pin-block construction to locate signal pins within a block along the specific patterns. Six pin patterns are proposed as templates which are automatically generated according to the user-defined constraints.

On one hand, learning overcomplete dictionaries that facilitate a sparse representation of the data as a liner combination of a few atoms from such dictionary leads to state-of-the-art results in image and video restoration and classification. On the other hand, the framework of compressed sensing (CS) has shown that sparse signals can be recovered from far less samples than those required by the classical Shannon-Nyquist Theorem. The samples used in CS correspond to linear projections obtained by a sensing projection matrix. It has been shown that, for example, a nonadaptive random sampling matrix satisfies the fundamental theoretical requirements of CS, enjoying the additional benefit of universality. On the other hand, a projection sensing matrix that is optimally designed for a certain class of signals can further improve the reconstruction accuracy or further reduce the necessary number of samples. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the joint design and optimization, from a set of training images, of the nonparametric dictionary and the sensing matrix. We show that this joint optimization outperforms both the use of random sensing matrices and those matrices that are optimized independently of the learning of the dictionary. Particular cases of the proposed framework include the optimization of the sensing matrix for a given dictionary as well as the optimization of the dictionary for a predefined sensing environment. The presentation of the framework and its efficient numerical optimization is complemented with numerous examples on classical image datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2022459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5073253/05061489.pdf","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2022459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Sense Sparse Signals: Simultaneous Sensing Matrix and Sparsifying Dictionary Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061489/","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Sense Sparse Signals: Simultaneous Sensing Matrix and Sparsifying Dictionary Optimization","volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10704744","pubMedId":"19497818","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061489/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Sense Sparse Signals: Simultaneous Sensing Matrix and Sparsifying Dictionary Optimization","sourcePdf":"18tip07-gsapiro-2022459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116049S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5073253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"372","xplore-issue":"5073253","articleId":"5061489","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061501,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Stanley McFall","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, Fogelsville, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5191259/5061501/5061501-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kevin Stanley McFall received the B.S. degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, in 1995, the M.S. degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2006, all in mechanical engineering.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor of Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, Lehigh Valley campus, Fogelsville, and has previously held faculty positions at universities in Sweden and France.

Separate research work has been published on the stability of fuzzy neural network and LS issue of unknown coupled chaotic neural networks, as well as its application in secure communication. However, there have not been any studies that integrate the two. Motivated by the achievements from both fields, we explored the benefits of integrating fuzzy logic theories into the study of LS problems and applied the findings to secure communication. Based on adaptive feedback control techniques and suitable parameter identification, several sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee the LS of coupled chaotic delayed YYFCNN with or without noise perturbation. The problem studied in this paper is more general in many aspects. Various problems studied extensively in the literature can be treated as special cases of the findings of this paper, such as complete synchronization (CS), effect of fuzzy logic, and noise perturbation. This paper presents an illustrative example and uses simulated results of this example to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed adaptive scheme. This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of application of the proposed adaptive feedback scheme in secure communication by comparing chaotic masking with fuzziness with some previous studies. Chaotic signal with fuzziness is more complex, which makes unmasking more difficult due to the added fuzzy logic.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2016842","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5159575/05061502.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2016842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lag Synchronization of Unknown Chaotic Delayed Yang\u2013Yang-Type Fuzzy Neural Networks With Noise Perturbation Based on Adaptive Control and Parameter Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Adaptive control","Parameter estimation","Chaotic communication","Fuzzy logic","Stability","Neural networks","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","chaos","feedback","fuzzy control","fuzzy logic","fuzzy neural nets","neurocontrollers","noise","perturbation techniques","stability","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lag synchronization","noise perturbation","adaptive control","parameter identification","unknown coupled chaotic delayed Yang-Yang-type fuzzy neural networks","stability","unknown coupled chaotic neural networks","secure communication","fuzzy logic theory","adaptive feedback control techniques","sufficient conditions","complete synchronization","adaptive feedback scheme","chaotic masking","chaotic signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","fuzzy cellular neural networks","parameter identification","synchronization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adaptation, Physiological","Algorithms","Artifacts","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Cortical Synchronization","Fuzzy Logic","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Lag Synchronization of Unknown Chaotic Delayed Yang\u2013Yang-Type Fuzzy Neural Networks With Noise Perturbation Based on Adaptive Control and Parameter Identification","volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5061502/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774890","pubMedId":"19497816","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lag Synchronization of Unknown Chaotic Delayed Yang\u2013Yang-Type Fuzzy Neural Networks With Noise Perturbation Based on Adaptive Control and Parameter Identification","sourcePdf":"tnn-xia-2016842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159846S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5159575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5159575","articleId":"5061502","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5061519,"authors":[{"name":"Hussam G.

To efficiently reduce power consumption, a novel dynamic-range detector is developed to dynamically detect the effective dynamic ranges of two input operands. The detection result is used to not only pick the operand with smaller dynamic range for Booth encoding to increase the probability of partial products becoming zero but also deactivate the redundant switching activities in ineffective ranges as much as possible. Moreover, the output product of the proposed multiplier can be truncated to further decrease power consumption by sacrificing a bit of output precision. To efficiently and correctly combine these techniques, some additional components, including a correcting-vector generator, an adjustor, a sign-bit generator, a modified error compensation circuit, etc., are also developed. Finally, three real-life applications are adopted to evaluate the power efficiency and error performance of the proposed multiplier. The results show that the proposed multiplier is more complex than non-CBMs, but significant power and energy savings can be achieved. Furthermore, the proposed multiplier maintains an acceptable output quality for these applications when truncation is performed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5424135/05061521.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2023763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2023763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5424135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Power-Efficient Configurable Booth Multiplier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Multimedia systems","Digital signal processing","Dynamic range","Encoding","Detectors","Error compensation","Circuits","Signal processing","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","encoding","multiplying circuits","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-efficient 16 times 16 configurable booth multiplier","power consumption reduction","dynamic-range detector","booth encoding","partial products probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Booth multiplier (BM)","configurable multiplication","low-power design","truncation","partially guarded computation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Power-Efficient Configurable Booth Multiplier","volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5061521/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11156356","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Power-Efficient Configurable Booth Multiplier","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kuang-2023763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123277S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5424135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5424135","articleId":"5061521","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061524,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 van Bezooijen","affiliation":["EPCOS Netherlands B.V., Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5410062/5061524/5061524-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andr\u00e9 van Bezooijen (M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Breda Technical University, Breda, The Netherlands, in 1984, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in adaptive RF front ends at the Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.","In 1998, he became a Senior Engineer with Philips Semiconductors, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, where, as a Project Leader, he was engaged in the concept development of power amplifier and front-end modules for cellular-phone applications.

The least square (LS) estimation problem of sparse OFDM channels is first formulated, showing that the key to sparse channel estimation lies in the detection of the MSTs. An in-depth study of the second-order statistics of the signal received through a noise-free sparse OFDM channel reveals the sparsity and other properties of the correlation functions of the received signal. These properties lead to a direct relationship between the positions of the MSTs of the sparse channel and the most significant lags of the correlation functions, which is then used in conjunction with a pilot-assisted LS estimation to detect the MSTs in a semi-blind fashion. It os also shown that the new MST detection algorithm can be extended for the estimation of multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)\u2013OFDM channels. A number of computer-simulation-based experiments for various sparse channels are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed semi-blind approach. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2023765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5424135/05061526.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2023765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5424135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Blind Most Significant Tap Detection for Sparse Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061526/","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Blind Most Significant Tap Detection for Sparse Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061526/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Blind Most Significant Tap Detection for Sparse Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsi-swamy-2023765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145591S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5424135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5424135","articleId":"5061526","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061527,"authors":[{"name":"Vanessa Moreno-Font","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5410062/5061527/5061527-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vanessa Moreno-Font was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1975.

First, the operation modes and the steady-state properties of the converter are addressed, and, then, a stability analysis that includes both the power stage and control parameters is carried out. Different bifurcations are determined from the averaged model and from the discrete-time model. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion is used to obtain the stability regions of the averaged (slow-scale) dynamics in the design parameter space, and a discrete-time approach is used to obtain more accurate results and to detect possible (fast-scale) subharmonic oscillations. Experimental measurements were taken from a system prototype to confirm the analytical results and numerical simulations. Some possible nonsmooth bifurcations due to the change in the switching patterns are also illustrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular

The key issue in current-based bearing fault detection is to extract bearing fault signatures from the motor stator current. Since the bearing fault signature in the stator current is typically very subtle, particularly when the fault is at an incipient stage, it is difficult to detect the fault signature directly. Therefore, in this paper, the bearing fault signature is detected alternatively by estimating and removing nonbearing fault components via a noise cancellation method. In this method, all the components of the stator current that are not related to bearing faults are regarded as noise and are estimated by a Wiener filter. Then, all these noise components are cancelled out by their estimates in a real-time fashion, and a fault indicator is established based on the remaining components which are mainly caused by bearing faults. Machine parameters, bearing dimensions, nameplate values, and the stator current spectrum distribution are not required in the method. The results of online experiments with a 20-hp induction motor under multiple load levels have confirmed the effectiveness of this method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incipient Bearing Fault Detection via Motor Stator Current Noise Cancellation Using Wiener Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2023566","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5166536/05061552.pdf","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2023566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Incipient Bearing Fault Detection via Motor Stator Current Noise Cancellation Using Wiener Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5061552/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"July-aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10781252","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incipient Bearing Fault Detection via Motor Stator Current Noise Cancellation Using Wiener Filter","sourcePdf":"tia-zhou-2023566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076915S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5166536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5166536","articleId":"5061552","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5061556,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Fan","affiliation":["Business and Economic Forecasting Unit, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5166536/5061556/5061556-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shu Fan (M'08) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 1995, 2000, and 2004, respectively.","He conducted postdoctoral research sponsored by the Japanese Government at Osaka Sangyo University, Daito, Japan, from 2004 to 2006.

In the deregulated power system, an improvement of a few percentages in the prediction accuracy would bring benefits worth of millions of dollars, which makes load forecasting become more important than ever before. This paper focuses on the short-term load forecasting for a power system in the U.S., where several alternative meteorological forecasts are available from different commercial weather services. To effectively take advantage of the alternative meteorological predictions in the load forecasting system, a new comprehensive forecasting methodology has been proposed in this paper. Specifically, combining forecasting using adaptive coefficients is applied to share the strength of the different temperature forecasts in the first stage, and then, ensemble neural networks have been used to improve the model's generalization performance based on bagging. The proposed load forecasting system has been verified by using the real data from the utility. A range of comparisons with different forecasting models have been conducted. The forecasting results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10781254","volume":"45","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5061556/","publicationDate":"July-aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Using Comprehensive Combination Based on Multimeteorological Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Using Comprehensive Combination Based on Multimeteorological Information","sourcePdf":"tia-fan-2023571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058324S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5166536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5166536","articleId":"5061556","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":5061558,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Shieh Kung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Taiwan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/5061558/5061558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying-Shieh Kung (M'03) was born in Taiwan in 1957.

A point-to-point (PTP) motion trajectory designed with the trapezoidal velocity profile is considered to smooth the move of the PMLSM at the start and stop conditions. Second, a finite-state machine (FSM) joined by a multiplier, an adder, a lookup table, and some comparators and registers is presented to model the overall AFC, and a VHSIC hardware description language is adopted to describe the circuit of the FSM. In addition, a Nios II embedded processor is used to implement the function of the PTP motion-trajectory algorithm by software. Finally, an experimental system is established to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FPGA-based AFC and the PTP motion-control system, and some experimental results are confirmed theoretically.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2023638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/05061558.pdf","startPage":"2923","endPage":"2932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2023638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Realization of an Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for PMLSM Drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Realization of an Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for PMLSM Drive","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061558/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793160","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Realization of an Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for PMLSM Drive","sourcePdf":"tie-kung-2023638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093029S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"5061558","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061559,"authors":[{"name":"Faqiang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Faqiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085796519"},{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293133600"},{"name":"Xikui Ma","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xikui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279528000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"5061559","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":982},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Slow-Scale Instability in Boost PFC Converter Using the Method of Harmonic Balance and Floquet Theory","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> In this paper, the slow-scale instability in a boost PFC converter under average current mode control is studied via the harmonic balance method and Floquet theory. Systematic and general numerical algorithm of the technique is developed. The objective is to identify instability of the system. If instability exists, the type of bifurcation and the boundaries of slow-scale instability in the parameter space of the system can be found for facilitating the design of such converters. Firstly, based on the fact that the current compensator is designed very well and what we considered is the slow-scale instability, the simplified model of a boost PFC converter under average current mode control is derived. And then, the solution of the simplified model is calculated by using the harmonic balance method. Subsequently, both the stability of the circuit system and the type of bifurcation are identified via Floquet theory. Meanwhile, the critical conditions of the stable operation in the parameter space of the system are given accurately.

The presence of many factorial terms in direct methods for computing Zernike-type moments makes their computation process a very time consuming task. Although the computational power of the modern computers is impressively increasing, the calculation of the factorial of a big number is still an inaccurate numerical procedure. The main concept of this paper is that, using Stirling's approximation for the factorial and applying some suitable mathematical properties, novel factorial-free direct methods can be developed.

In addition, their variability does not affect their ability to uniquely describe and distinguish the objects that they represent.

In this paper, an available method is proposed to solve them by using neural networks (NNs) and a robust control scheme for improving the performance. First, a simplified torque calculation model based on finite-element method results can guarantee quick prediction of electromagnetic torque with lower error. Thus, the system model considering the friction, load, and disturbances is developed. Second, a robust NN (RNN) control scheme is presented to eliminate uncertainties to improve the tracking robust stability and overcome the undesired influence of uncertainties based on the nonlinear system dynamic model under continuous-trajectory tracking mode. Finally, as an example, the step-response and continuous-tracking processes of the motor using an RNN controller are simulated, and experiments, including the tracking using RNN proportional-differential control, are carried out to confirm the usefulness of the proposed control scheme. The simulation and experimental results of the proposed control scheme on the spherical stepper motor system demonstrate the effectiveness on satisfactory tracking performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2023639","startPage":"2945","endPage":"2954","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/05061562.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2023639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Control of PM Spherical Stepper Motor Based on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Neural networks","Uncertainty","Recurrent neural networks","Proportional control","Friction","Torque","Robust stability","Control systems","Magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","machine control","neural nets","permanent magnet motors","robust control","stepping motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet spherical stepper motor","robust control","robust neural networks","real dynamic system","3D tracking performance","simplified torque calculation","finite element method","electromagnetic torque","robust stability","nonlinear system dynamic model","continuous trajectory tracking mode","proportional-differential control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic model","permanent magnet (PM)","robust neural network (RNN) control","spherical stepper motor","tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Control of PM Spherical Stepper Motor Based on Neural Networks","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5061562/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10793161","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Control of PM Spherical Stepper Motor Based on Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2023639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060632S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"5061562","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5061563,"authors":[{"name":"Xinmiao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5424135/5061563/5061563-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinmiao Zhang (S'04\u2013M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, in 2005, all in electrical engineering.","Since then, she has been with Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, where she is currently a Timothy E. and Allison L.

Algebraic soft-decision decoding (ASD) of RS codes can achieve substantial coding gain with polynomial complexity. Among practical ASD algorithms, the iterative bit-level generalized minimum distance (BGMD) decoding can achieve similar or higher coding gain with lower complexity. The interpolation is a major step of ASD. The maximum achievable speed of this step is limited by the inherent serial nature of the interpolation algorithm. In this paper, a novel interpolation scheme that is capable of combining multiple interpolation iterations, as well as sharing interpolation results from previous decoding iterations, is developed for the iterative BGMD decoding. In addition, efficient VLSI architectures are proposed to implement the developed scheme. Based on the proposed architectures, an interpolator for a (255, 239) RS code is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. On a Xilinx Virtex-II device, our interpolator can achieve a throughput of 440 Mbps, which is 64% higher than the fastest previous design, with 51% less FPGA resource.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11156357","htmlLink":"/document/5061563/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Throughput Interpolation Architecture for Algebraic Soft-Decision Reed\u2013Solomon Decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Throughput Interpolation Architecture for Algebraic Soft-Decision Reed\u2013Solomon Decoding","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhu-2023935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068992S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5424135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5424135","articleId":"5061563","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061564,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongkui Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5382607/5061564/5061564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongkui Li received the B.S. degree in aerospace engineering from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2005.

A distributed observer-type consensus protocol based on relative output measurements is proposed. A new framework is introduced to address in a unified way the consensus of multiagent systems and the synchronization of complex networks. Under this framework, the consensus of multiagent systems with a communication topology having a spanning tree can be cast into the stability of a set of matrices of the same low dimension. The notion of consensus region is then introduced and analyzed. It is shown that there exists an observer-type protocol solving the consensus problem and meanwhile yielding an unbounded consensus region if and only if each agent is both stabilizable and detectable. A multistep consensus protocol design procedure is further presented. The consensus with respect to a time-varying state and the robustness of the consensus protocol to external disturbances are finally discussed. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated through numerical simulations, with an application to low-Earth-orbit satellite formation flying.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","volume":"57","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11162413","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5061564/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Consensus of Multiagent Systems and Synchronization of Complex Networks: A Unified Viewpoint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus of Multiagent Systems and Synchronization of Complex Networks: A Unified Viewpoint","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zli-2023937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.235335S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5382607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1491","xplore-issue":"5382607","articleId":"5061564","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5061569,"authors":[{"name":"Ockgoo Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5424135/5061569/5061569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ockgoo Lee (S\u201905) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2005, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.","During 2008, he was an Intern with Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, where he was engaged in the investigation on inductors over active circuitry.

The converter is based on a digital bang-bang delay-lock loop, which allows constant resolution over process and temperatures spreads, avoids an off-chip filter and guarantees fast lock. The clock rate of the digital filter is scaled down by eight from the 3.5-GHz input to allow its implementation with standard cells. The occurrence of a limit cycle is analytically predicted and properly minimized, and its effect on the PLL phase noise is discussed. The circuit fabricated in 90-nm CMOS entails 16 delay stages, which lock to the input frequency in the 2.9-3.9-GHz range (limited by the available signal source). The delay of each TDC cell can be controlled with 50-fs step and the TDC time resolution is 16 ps at 3.9 GHz. The power consumption ranges between 8.1 and 16.5 mW, respectively.

Artificial light interference (ALI) is a periodic signal with a spectrum profile extending up to the MHz range. It is the dominant source of performance degradation at low data rates, which can be removed using a high-pass filter (HPF). On the other hand, ISI is more severe at high data rates and an equalizing filter is incorporated at the receiver to compensate for the ISI. This paper provides the simulation results for a discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-artificial neural network (ANN)-based receiver architecture for on-and-off keying (OOK) non-return-to-zero (NRZ) scheme for a diffuse indoor OW link in the presence of ALI and ISI. ANN is adopted for classification acting as an efficient equalizer compared to the traditional equalizers. The ALI is effectively reduced by proper selection of the DWT coefficients resulting in improved receiver performance compared to the digital HPF. The simulated bit error rate (BER) performance of proposed DWT-ANN receiver structure for a diffuse indoor OW link operating at a data range of 10-200 Mbps is presented and discussed. The results are compared with performance of a diffuse link with an HPF-equalizer, ALI with/without filtering, and a line-of-sight (LOS) without filtering. We show that the DWT-ANN display a lower power requirement when compared to the receiver with an HPF-equalizer over a full range of delay spread in presence of ALI. However, as expected compared to the ideal LOS link the power penalty is higher reaching to 6 dB at 200 Mbps data rate.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5224043/05061572.pdf","startPage":"4493","endPage":"4500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2024432","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2024432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Denoising and Adaptive Equalization of Indoor Optical Wireless Channel With Artificial Light Using the Discrete Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effective Denoising and Adaptive Equalization of Indoor Optical Wireless Channel With Artificial Light Using the Discrete Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061572/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061572/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10860176","volume":"27","issue":"20","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Denoising and Adaptive Equalization of Indoor Optical Wireless Channel With Artificial Light Using the Discrete Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jlt-rajbhandari-2024432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062529S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5224043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5224043","articleId":"5061572","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061574,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxia Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/5061574/5061574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoxia Wu (S'06) received the B.E. degree from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2004, and the M.E degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2006.

Simultaneous identification of optical signal-to-noise-ratio (OSNR), chromatic dispersion (CD), and polarization-mode-dispersion (PMD) from eye-diagram parameters is shown via simulation in both 40 Gb/s on-off keying (OOK) and differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) systems. Experimental verification is performed to simultaneously identify OSNR and CD. We then extend this technique to simultaneously identify accumulated fiber nonlinearity, OSNR, CD, and PMD from eye-diagram and eye-histogram parameters in a 3-channel 40 Gb/s DPSK wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) system. Furthermore, we propose using this ANN approach to monitor impairment causing changes from a baseline. Simultaneous identification of accumulated fiber nonlinearity, OSNR, CD, and PMD causing changes from a baseline by use of the eye-diagram and eye-histogram parameters is obtained and high correlation coefficients are achieved with various baselines. Finally, the ANNs are also shown for simultaneous identification of in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) data misalignment and data/carver misalignment in return-to-zero differential quadrature phase shift keying (RZ-DQPSK) transmitters.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2024435","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5170198/05061574.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2024435","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"3580","endPage":"3589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Artificial Neural Networks in Optical Performance Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Artificial Neural Networks in Optical Performance Monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061574/","volume":"27","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/5061574/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10792973","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Artificial Neural Networks in Optical Performance Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jlt-wu-2024435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081423S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5170198","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5170198","articleId":"5061574","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5061575,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathon W.

Recognition paradigms must adapt with the user in order to be clinically viable over time. Most existing paradigms are static, although two forms of adaptation have received limited attention. Supervised adaptation can achieve high accuracy since the intended class is known, but at the cost of repeated cumbersome training sessions. Unsupervised adaptation attempts to achieve high accuracy without knowledge of the intended class, thus achieving adaptation that is not cumbersome to the user, but at the cost of reduced accuracy. This study reports a novel adaptive experiment on eight subjects that allowed repeated measures post-hoc comparison of four supervised and three unsupervised adaptation paradigms. All supervised adaptation paradigms reduced error over time by at least 26% compared to the nonadapting classifier. Most unsupervised adaptation paradigms provided smaller reductions in error, due to frequent uncertainty of the correct class. One method that selected high-confidence samples showed the most practical implementation, although the other methods warrant future investigation. Supervised adaptation should be considered for incorporation into any clinically viable pattern recognition controller, and unsupervised adaptation should receive renewed interest in order to provide transparent adaptation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10730201","pubMedId":"19497834","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5061575/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Pattern Recognition of Myoelectric Signals: Exploration of Conceptual Framework and Practical Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Pattern Recognition of Myoelectric Signals: Exploration of Conceptual Framework and Practical Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tnsre-jsensinger-2023282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063897S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5089923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"5089923","articleId":"5061575","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5061581,"authors":[{"name":"Cynthia A.

Current systems have primarily been designed for immobile patients, such as tetraplegics functioning in a rather static, carefully tailored environment. However, an active patient such as amputee in a normal dynamic, everyday environment may be quite different in terms of the neural control of movement. In order to study motor control in a more unconstrained natural setting, we seek to develop an animal model of freely moving humans. Therefore, we have developed and tested HermesC-INI3, a system for recording and wirelessly transmitting neural data from electrode arrays implanted in rhesus macaques who are freely moving. This system is based on the integrated neural interface (INI3) microchip which amplifies, digitizes, and transmits neural data across a ~ 900 MHz wireless channel. The wireless transmission has a range of ~ 4 m in free space. All together this device consumes 15.8 mA and 63.2 mW. On a single 2 A-hr battery pack, this device runs contiguously for approximately six days. The smaller size and power consumption of the custom IC allows for a smaller package (51 times 38 times 38 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) than previous primate systems. The HermesC-INI3 system was used to record and telemeter one channel of broadband neural data at 15.7 kSps from a monkey performing routine daily activities in the home cage.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2023293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/5200715/05061581.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2023293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HermesC: Low-Power Wireless Neural Recording System for Freely Moving Primates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061581/","displayDocTitle":"HermesC: Low-Power Wireless Neural Recording System for Freely Moving Primates","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816739","pubMedId":"19497829","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061581/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HermesC: Low-Power Wireless Neural Recording System for Freely Moving Primates","sourcePdf":"tnsre-kshenoy-2023293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094607S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5200715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5200715","articleId":"5061581","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061582,"authors":[{"name":"Nitin Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/5349072/5061582/5061582-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nitin Sharma received the B.E. degree in industrial engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (Currently, Thapar University), Patiala, India, in 2004.

Towards this goal, the objective of the current effort is to develop a NMES controller to produce a knee position trajectory that will enable a human shank to track any continuous desired trajectory (or constant setpoint). A nonlinear control method is developed to control the human quadriceps femoris muscle undergoing nonisometric contractions. The developed controller does not require a muscle model and can be proven to yield asymptotic stability for a nonlinear muscle model in the presence of bounded nonlinear disturbances (e.g., spasticity, delays, fatigue). The performance of the controller is demonstrated through a series of closed-loop experiments on human subjects. The experiments illustrate the ability of the controller to enable the leg shank to track single and multiple period trajectories with different periods and ranges of motion, and also track desired step changes with changing loads.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2023294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/5349072/05061582.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2023294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Tracking Control of a Human Limb","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061582/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Tracking Control of a Human Limb","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11037605","pubMedId":"19497828","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061582/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Tracking Control of a Human Limb","sourcePdf":"tnsre-dixon-2023294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092431S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5349072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5349072","articleId":"5061582","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061585,"authors":[{"name":"Reid R.

The spread is shown to be independent of the tunnel-dielectric stack composition for low amplitudes of the programming staircase, for which the granular electron injection follows the Poisson statistics. Differences in the spread arise instead for large staircase step amplitudes, as in this regime the sub-Poissonian nature of the electron-injection process strictly depends on the steepness of the tunnel-dielectric current-voltage characteristics. This steepness can be modified by changing the electron-injection regime from Fowler-Nordheim (FN) to direct tunneling (DT) to modified FN (MFN): MFN is shown to allow a reduction of the electron-injection spread with respect to FN tunneling, while the DT regime gives rise to a large increase of the spread.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10731592","htmlLink":"/document/5061605/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the Electron-Injection Spread in Barrier-Engineered <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">NAND </emphasis> Flash Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the Electron-Injection Spread in Barrier-Engineered <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">NAND </emphasis> Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"led-monziocompagnoni-2021494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112429S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5109799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5109799","articleId":"5061605","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061611,"authors":[{"name":"Songnian Fu","affiliation":["Network Technology Research Centre School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Songnian","lastName":"Fu","id":"37307492100"},{"name":"Wen-De Zhong","affiliation":["Network Technology Research Centre School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wen-De","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37279780200"},{"name":"Perry Ping Shum","affiliation":["Network Technology Research Centre School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Perry Ping","lastName":"Shum","id":"37272536900"},{"name":"Chinlon Lin","affiliation":["Network Technology Research Centre School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chinlon","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278420400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5061611","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Optical polarization","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Microwave generation","Signal generators","Microwave frequencies","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Optical harmonic generation","Optical interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light polarisation","microwave photonics","optical harmonic generation","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency multiplication","microwave signals","self-induced nonlinear polarization rotation","semiconductor optical amplifiers","carrier-to-noise ratio","frequency doubling","Mach-Zehnder interferometer","frequency 10 GHz","frequency 20 GHz","frequency 40 GHz","wavelength 1520 nm to 1560 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave photonics","nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR)","photonic microwave generation","semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061611","abstract":"We propose and demonstrate a photonic approach for frequency multiplication of microwave signals based on the self-induced nonlinear polarization rotation arising in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs).

To accomplish the process of cross-range scaling, the rotating velocity (RV) of the target should be estimated first. For a uniformly planar rotating object, a novel method based on a concept of rotation correlation is proposed to obtain the RV in this letter, and neither prominent scattering centers nor phase coefficient extraction is required. Furthermore, a three-step fast-Fourier-transform-based convolution interpolation scheme is proposed to realize the above correlation, which makes the proposed method more efficient for implementation. Finally, experimental results with both simulated and real ISAR data are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for different targets.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2009.2021990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5153590/05061616.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2009.2021990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153590","startPage":"597","endPage":"601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Range Scaling for ISAR Based on Image Rotation Correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Range Scaling for ISAR Based on Image Rotation Correlation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10735832","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5061616/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Range Scaling for ISAR Based on Image Rotation Correlation","sourcePdf":"lgrs-yeh-2021990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092019S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5153590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5153590","articleId":"5061616","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061618,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir A.

This is especially evident in multi-user systems, where the spatial user separability determines the multiplexing gain, but it is also important for transmission-rate adaptation in single-user systems. To limit the feedback load, the unknown and multi-dimensional channel needs to be represented by a limited number of bits. When combined with long-term channel statistics, the norm of the channel matrix has been shown to provide substantial CSI that permits efficient user selection, linear precoder design, and rate adaptation. Herein, we consider quantized feedback of the squared Frobenius norm in a Rayleigh fading environment with arbitrary spatial correlation. The conditional channel statistics are characterized and their moments are derived for both identical, distinct, and sets of repeated eigenvalues. These results are applied for minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of signal and interference powers in single- and multi-user systems, for the purpose of reliable rate adaptation and resource allocation. The problem of efficient feedback quantization is discussed and an entropy-maximizing framework is developed where the post-user-selection distribution can be taken into account in the design of the quantization levels. The analytic results of this paper are directly applicable in many widely used communication techniques, such as space-time block codes, linear precoding, space division multiple access (SDMA), and scheduling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","volume":"57","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10869435","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5061630/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Quantized Channel Norm Feedback Through Conditional Statistics in Arbitrarily Correlated MIMO Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Quantized Channel Norm Feedback Through Conditional Statistics in Arbitrarily Correlated MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-ebjornson-2024266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104732S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"5061630","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5061634,"authors":[{"name":"Nadine Gergel-Hackett","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nadine","lastName":"Gergel-Hackett","id":"38274264500"},{"name":"Behrang Hamadani","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Behrang","lastName":"Hamadani","id":"37316595000"},{"name":"Barbara Dunlap","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Dunlap","id":"38277620900"},{"name":"John Suehle","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Suehle","id":"37281743300"},{"name":"Curt Richter","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Curt","lastName":"Richter","id":"37297319900"},{"name":"Christina Hacker","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Hacker","id":"37322358400"},{"name":"David Gundlach","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gundlach","id":"37268911600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5061634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":183,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2955},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061634","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","NIST","Nonvolatile memory","Spinning","Contacts","Computer hacking","Polymer gels","Titanium","Substrates","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible electronics","resistors","sol-gel processing","titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible solution-processed memristor","rewriteable low-power operation","nonvolatile device","spinning","sol-gel method","polymer sheet","memory behavior","temperature 293 K to 298 K","TiO2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flexible electronics","flexible memory","memristor","sol gel","titanium dioxide"]}],"abstract":"A rewriteable low-power operation nonvolatile physically flexible memristor device is demonstrated.

To this end, a fully distributed (D-) RLS algorithm is developed for use by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) whereby sensors exchange messages with one-hop neighbors to consent on the network-wide estimates adaptively. The WSNs considered here do not necessarily possess a Hamiltonian cycle, while the inter-sensor links are challenged by communication noise. The novel algorithm is obtained after judiciously reformulating the exponentially-weighted least-squares cost into a separable form, which is then optimized via the alternating-direction method of multipliers. If powerful error control codes are utilized and communication noise is not an issue, D-RLS is modified to reduce communication overhead when compared to existing noise-unaware alternatives. Numerical simulations demonstrate that D-RLS can outperform existing approaches in terms of estimation performance and noise resilience, while it has the potential of performing efficient tracking.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Recursive Least-Squares for Consensus-Based In-Network Adaptive Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2024278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05061644.pdf","startPage":"4583","endPage":"4588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2024278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Recursive Least-Squares for Consensus-Based In-Network Adaptive Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5061644/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918075","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Recursive Least-Squares for Consensus-Based In-Network Adaptive Estimation","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-ggiannakis-2024278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051018S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5061644","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5061645,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chai","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Metallurgical Automation and Measurement Technology, and the Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Equipment and Control, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5238723/5061645/5061645-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Chai (S'00\u2013M'03) received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and the M.

By means of electrothermal finite-element simulations and measurements, the characteristics of the reset state (resistance after switching, threshold voltage, and stability of the state) are related to the physical parameters during reset switching (the temporal and spatial distribution of the temperature during switching, the evolution of the melting and molten phases, and the time that the line is molten). From a device point of view, we emphasize the following aspects: 1) Due to good thermal isolation, the line cell can be reset using a 5-ns short current pulse of limited amplitude; 2) longer pulsewidths allow lower reset current amplitudes due to the gradual heating of surrounding dielectric; 3) the reset resistance has no direct relation with the threshold voltage but is strongly related to the number of reset pulses applied to the cell; and 4) shorter pulsewidths allow extended endurance lifetimes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061650/","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5061650/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10705058","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transient Characteristics of the Reset Programming of a Phase-Change Line Cell and the Effect of the Reset Parameters on the Obtained State","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Characteristics of the Reset Programming of a Phase-Change Line Cell and the Effect of the Reset Parameters on the Obtained State","sourcePdf":"ted-goux-2021444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149821S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5075842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5075842","articleId":"5061650","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5061734,"authors":[{"name":"Shin Kamei","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5208445/5061734/5061734-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shin Kamei was born in Saitama, Japan, on September 19, 1972.

It has the ability to achieve NRZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK to CSRZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK, RZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK to CSRZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK, and CSRZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK to RZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK format conversions. A comprehensive dynamic model to investigate twelve FWM-related waves in SOA is presented. Using this model, the proposed module with multiple format conversions is numerically investigated. We find that the SOA based scheme can be used for high-speed all-optical multifunction format conversion, because one of the FWM participators also serves as an assist light to accelerate SOA gain recovery. Meanwhile three identical converted signals with different wavelengths can be obtained simultaneously for all-optical wavelength multicast application. Finally, the bit-error-rate (BER) measurements of some 10 Gb/s operations are demonstrated in order to further verify the proposed multifunction format conversion module.

Multihop data delivery between vehicles is an important aspect for the support of VANET-based applications. Although data dissemination and routing have extensively been addressed, many unique characteristics of VANETs, together with the diversity in promising applications, offer newer research challenges. This paper introduces the improved greedy traffic-aware routing protocol (GyTAR), which is an intersection-based geographical routing protocol that is capable of finding robust and optimal routes within urban environments. The main principle behind GyTAR is the dynamic and in-sequence selection of intersections through which data packets are forwarded to the destinations. The intersections are chosen considering parameters such as the remaining distance to the destination and the variation in vehicular traffic. Data forwarding between intersections in GyTAR adopts an improved greedy carry-and-forward mechanism. Evaluation of the proposed routing protocol shows significant performance improvement in comparison with other existing routing approaches. With the aid of extensive simulations, we also validate the optimality and sensitivity of significant GyTAR parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2024341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05061874.pdf","startPage":"5048","endPage":"5059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2024341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Efficient Geographic Routing in Urban Vehicular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061874/","displayDocTitle":"Towards Efficient Geographic Routing in Urban Vehicular Networks","volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966637","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061874/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Efficient Geographic Routing in Urban Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-jerbi-2024341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117544S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5061874","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5061876,"authors":[{"name":"Dusan Gleich","affiliation":["Laboratory of Signal Processing and Remote Control, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Dusan","lastName":"Gleich","id":"37063718500"},{"name":"Matej Kseneman","affiliation":["Laboratory of Signal Processing and Remote Control, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Matej","lastName":"Kseneman","id":"37322404000"},{"name":"Mihai Datcu","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute IMF, German AeroSpace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Datcu","id":"37265637100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5061876","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents the despeckling of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images within the bandelet and contourlet domains.

We propose two algorithms, one for the estimation of the masks which are to be applied to the mixture in the TF domain for the separation of signals in the frequency domain, and the other for solving the permutation problem. The algorithm for mask estimation is based on the concept of angles in complex vector space. Unlike the previously reported methods, the algorithm does not require any estimation of the mixing matrix or the source positions for mask estimation. The algorithm clusters the mixture samples in the TF domain based on the Hermitian angle between the sample vector and a reference vector using the well known \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n -means or fuzzy \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</i>\n -means clustering algorithms. The membership functions so obtained from the clustering algorithms are directly used as the masks. The algorithm for solving the permutation problem clusters the estimated masks by using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-means clustering of small groups of nearby masks with overlap.

In multirate anypath routing, each node uses both a set of next hops and a selected transmission rate to reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the nodes in the set and one of them forwards the packet on to the destination. To date, there is no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of next hops and the transmission rate used by each node. We bridge this gap by introducing a polynomial-time algorithm to this problem and provide the proof of its optimality. The proposed algorithm runs in the same running time as regular shortest-path algorithms and is therefore suitable for deployment in link-state routing protocols. We conducted experiments in a 802.11b testbed network, and our results show that multirate anypath routing performs on average 80% and up to 6.4 times better than anypath routing with a fixed rate of 11 Mbps. If the rate is fixed at 1 Mbps instead, performance improves by up to one order of magnitude.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","startPage":"37","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061904.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate Anypath Routing in Wireless Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5061904/","displayDocTitle":"Multirate Anypath Routing in Wireless Mesh Networks","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685400","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate Anypath Routing in Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-02-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086155S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5061923,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Assuming that the sender is providing the same data to multiple receivers over independent packet erasure channels, we focus on the case of perfect feedback and heterogeneous erasure probabilities. Based on a general analytical framework for evaluating the decoding delay, we show that existing ARQ schemes fail to ensure that receivers with weak channels are able to recover from packet losses within reasonable time. To overcome this problem, we re-define the encoding rules in order to break the chains of linear combinations that cannot be decoded after one of the packets is lost. Our results show that sending uncoded packets at key times ensures that all the receivers are able to meet specific delay requirements with very high probability.","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061923.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"216","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Delay Control in Online Network Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effective Delay Control in Online Network Coding","htmlLink":"/document/5061923/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685419","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Delay Control in Online Network Coding","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-06-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066716S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5061924,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In response, Shanghai Grid (SG) aims to provide abundant intelligent transportation services to improve the traffic condition. A challenging service in SG is to estimate the real-time traffic condition on surface streets. In this paper, we present an innovative approach SEER to tackle this problem. In SEER, we deploy a cost-effective system of taxi traffic sensors. These taxi sensory data are found to be noisy and very lossy in both time and space. By intensively mining the spatio-temporal correlations along with the evolution of traffic condition, SEER provides wealthy knowledge to setup statistical models for inferring traffic condition when they cannot be directly calculated. As an example, we demonstrate utilizing multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) to iteratively produce estimates of traffic condition in a metropolitan scale. The optimal window width of MSSA is determined with the basic periodicity found in traffic condition. Moreover, we minimize the number of channels required by MSSA to estimate traffic condition at any location. Given a desired estimation granularity, we optimize the MSSA parameters to minimize the estimation error.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061924","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","startPage":"217","endPage":"225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEER: Metropolitan-Scale Traffic Perception Based on Lossy Sensory Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SEER: Metropolitan-Scale Traffic Perception Based on Lossy Sensory Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061924/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685420","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5061924/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEER: Metropolitan-Scale Traffic Perception Based on Lossy Sensory Data","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-07-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073311S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5061926,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Our objective is to devise a fully-distributed caching strategy whereby nodes, independently of each other, decide whether to cache or not some content, and for how long. Each node takes this decision according to its perception of what nearby users may be storing in their caches and with the aim to differentiate its own cache content from the others'. We aptly named such algorithm \"Hamlet\". The result is the creation of a content diversity within the nodes neighborhood, so that a requesting user likely finds the desired information nearby. We simulate our caching algorithm in an urban scenario, featuring vehicular mobility, as well as in a mall scenario with pedestrians carrying mobile devices. Comparison with other caching schemes under different forwarding strategies confirms that Hamlet succeeds in creating the desired content diversity thus leading to a resource-efficient information access.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061926.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To Cache or Not To Cache?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Telecommunication traffic","Cooperative caching","Vehicles","Weather forecasting","Broadcasting","Ad hoc networks","Cache storage","Communications Society","Mobile ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cache storage","distributed processing","mobile radio","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative caching","mobile ad hoc network","peer-to-peer computing","Hamlet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"To Cache or Not To Cache?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061926/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685422","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To Cache or Not To Cache?","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-07-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061991S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5061943,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Achieving high-throughputs while reducing both memory-usage and memory-bandwidth needs is inherently difficult. In this paper, we propose a pattern (string) matching algorithm that achieves high throughput while limiting both memory-usage and memory-bandwidth. We achieve this by moving away from a byte-oriented processing of patterns to a block-oriented scheme. However, different from previous block-oriented approaches, our scheme uses variable-stride blocks. These blocks can be uniquely identified in both the pattern and the input stream, hence avoiding the multiplied memory costs which is intrinsic in previous approaches. We present the algorithm, tradeoffs, optimizations, and implementation details. Performance evaluation is done using the Snort and ClamAV pattern sets. Using our algorithm, the throughput of a single search engine can easily have a many-fold increase at a small storage cost, typically less than three bytes per pattern character.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061946","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061946.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061946","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","startPage":"415","endPage":"423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-Stride Multi-Pattern Matching For Scalable Deep Packet Inspection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Variable-Stride Multi-Pattern Matching For Scalable Deep Packet Inspection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061946/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061946/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685442","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-Stride Multi-Pattern Matching For Scalable Deep Packet Inspection","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-12-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102406S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5061947,"authors":[{"name":"N.

While popular systems like Snort are used in many network locations, comprehensive deployment across Tier-1 service provider networks is costly due to the need for high-speed monitors at many network ingress points. Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept. We evaluate prediction accuracy of candidate ML algorithms on actual packet traces. The duration of prediction effectiveness is an issue for ML approaches and more so in resource intensive network applications. Initial results show little impairment of performance over periods of one or two weeks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061947.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rule-Based Anomaly Detection on IP Flows","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Payloads","Inspection","Monitoring","Statistics","Costs","Intrusion detection","Computer worms","Buffer overflow","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","learning (artificial intelligence)","security of data","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule-based anomaly detection","packet classification","network traffic","network security","Tier-1 service provider network","IP flow","machine learning approach","network-wide flow-alarming architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Rule-Based Anomaly Detection on IP Flows","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061947/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685443","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rule-Based Anomaly Detection on IP Flows","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-12-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125615S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5061948,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The paper establishes an asymptotic regime in which systems with and without coding have the same performance. The space of all systems is partitioned into two regions where coding is beneficial and detrimental, respectively.

Our previous work has attempted to design a hardware-accelerated and multi-threaded implementation of network coding to fully utilize multi-core CPUs, as well as SSE2 and AltiVec SIMD vector instructions on X86 and PowerPC processors. This paper represents another step forward, and presents the first attempt in the literature to maximize the performance of network coding by taking advantage of not only multi-core CPUs, but also potentially hundreds of computing cores in commodity off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPU). With GPU computing gaining momentum as a result of increased hardware capabilities and improved programmability, our work shows how the GPU, with a design involving thousands of lightweight threads, can boost network coding performance significantly. Many-core GPUs can be deployed as an attractive alternative and complementary solution to multi-core servers, by offering a better price/performance advantage. In fact, multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs can be deployed and used to perform network coding simultaneously, potentially useful in media streaming servers where hundreds of peers are served concurrently by these dedicated servers. In this paper, we present Nuclei, the design and implementation of GPU-based network coding. With Nuclei, only one mainstream NVidia 8800 GT GPU outperforms an 8-core Intel Xeon server in most test cases. A combined CPU-GPU encoding scenario achieves coding rates of up to 116 MB/second for a variety of coding settings, which is sufficient to saturate a Gigabit Ethernet interface.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061951.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"467","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nuclei: GPU-Accelerated Many-Core Network Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Network servers","Computer networks","Streaming media","Computational complexity","Graphics","Hardware","Yarn","Testing","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","encoding","local area networks","media streaming","multicast communication","multimedia servers","multi-threading","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nuclei GPU-accelerated many-core network coding","optimal flow rate","multicast session","computational complexity","multithreaded implementation","multicore CPU","SSE2 SIMD vector instruction","AltiVec SIMD vector instruction","X86 processor","PowerPC processor","off-the-shelf graphics processing unit","multicore server","media streaming server","NVidia 8800 GT GPU","8-core Intel Xeon server","CPU-GPU encoding scenario","Gigabit Ethernet interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nuclei: GPU-Accelerated Many-Core Network Coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685447","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nuclei: GPU-Accelerated Many-Core Network Coding","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-13-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074456S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5061954,"authors":[{"name":"I.-H.

Two problems arise when dealing with traffic with QoS constraints. One is admission control, which consists of determining whether it is possible to fulfill the demands of a set of clients. The other is finding an optimal scheduling policy to meet the demands of all clients. In this paper, we propose a framework for jointly addressing three QoS criteria: delay, delivery ratio, and channel reliability. We analytically prove the necessary and sufficient condition for a set of clients to be feasible with respect to the above three criteria. We then establish an efficient algorithm for admission control to decide whether a set of clients is feasible. We further propose two scheduling policies and prove that they are feasibility optimal in the sense that they can meet the demands of every feasible set of clients. In addition, we show that these policies are easily implementable on the IEEE 802.11 mechanisms. We also present the results of simulation studies that appear to confirm the theoretical studies and suggest that the proposed policies outperform others tested under a variety of settings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theory of QoS for Wireless","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061954","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061954.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Theory of QoS for Wireless","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061954/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685450","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theory of QoS for Wireless","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-14-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054424S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5061958,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Inspired by sparse random graph codes, counter braids solves two central problems of per-flow measurement: one-to-one flow-to-counter association and large amount of unused counter space. It eliminates the one-to-one association by randomly hashing a flow label to multiple counters and minimizes counter space by incrementally compressing counts as they accumulate. The random hash values are reproduced offline from a list of flow labels, with which flow sizes are decoded using a fast message passing algorithm. The decoding of counter braids introduces the problem of collecting flow labels active in a measurement epoch. An exact solution to this problem is expensive. This paper complements the previous proposal with an approximate flow label collection scheme and a novel error-resilient decoder that decodes despite missing flow labels. The approximate flow label collection detects new flows with variable-length signature counting Bloom filters in SRAM, and stores flow labels in high-density DRAM. It provides a good trade-off between space and accuracy: more than 99 percent of the flows are captured with very little SRAM space. The decoding challenge posed by missing flow labels calls for a new algorithm as the original message passing decoder becomes error-prone. In terms of sparse random graph codes, the problem is equivalent to decoding with graph deficiency, a scenario beyond coding theory. The error-resilient decoder employs a new message passing algorithm that recovers most flow sizes exactly despite graph deficiency. Together, our solution achieves a 10-fold reduction in SRAM space compared to hash-table based implementations, as demonstrated with Internet trace evaluations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Counting Via Counter Braids: An Error-Resilient Network Measurement Architecture","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061958","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061958.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Counting Via Counter Braids: An Error-Resilient Network Measurement Architecture","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061958/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685454","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Counting Via Counter Braids: An Error-Resilient Network Measurement Architecture","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-15-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073425S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5061962,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, the savings could come at a significant cost in delay performance. Recently, researchers have attempted to exploit the inherent broadcast nature of the wireless medium to reduce this delay with virtually no additional energy cost. These schemes are called \"anycasting,\" where each sensor node forwards the packet to the first node that wakes up among a set of candidate next-hop nodes. In this paper, we develop a delay-optimal anycasting scheme under periodic sleep-wake patterns. Our solution is computationally simple and fully distributed. We show that periodic sleep-wake patterns result in the smallest delay among all wake-up patterns under given energy constraints. Simulation results illustrate the benefit of our proposed schemes over the state-of-the art.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061968","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","startPage":"612","endPage":"620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Anycast Technique for Delay-Sensitive Energy-Constrained Asynchronous Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Anycast Technique for Delay-Sensitive Energy-Constrained Asynchronous Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061968/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685464","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5061968/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Anycast Technique for Delay-Sensitive Energy-Constrained Asynchronous Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-18-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065567S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5061969,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Although a sensor node is likely to be equipped with only one antenna, it is possible to group several sensors to form a virtual MIMO link. Such grouping can be formed by means of clustering. In this paper, we propose a distributed MIMO-adaptive energy-efficient clustering/routing scheme, coined cooperative MIMO (CMIMO), which aims at reducing energy consumption in multi- hop WSNs. In CMIMO, each cluster has up to two cluster heads (CHs), which are responsible for routing traffic between clusters (i.e., inter-cluster communications). CMIMO has the ability to adapt the transmission mode and transmission power on a per-packet basis. The transmission mode can be one of four transmit/receive configurations: 1 times 1 (SISO), 2 times 1 (MISO), 1 times 2 (SIMO), and 2 times 2 (MIMO). We study the performance of CMIMO via simulations. Results indicate that our proposed scheme achieves a significant reduction in energy consumption, compared to non-adaptive clustered WSNs.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061969","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061969.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Clustering/Routing for Cooperative MIMO Operation in Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061969/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Clustering/Routing for Cooperative MIMO Operation in Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685465","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061969/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Clustering/Routing for Cooperative MIMO Operation in Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-18-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104236S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5061972,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

To fill the gap between theory and practice, in this paper, we propose a novel packet classification algorithm named HyperSplit. Compared to the well-known HiCuts and HSM algorithms, HyperSplit achieves superior performance in terms of classification speed, memory usage and preprocessing time. The practicability of the proposed algorithm is manifested by two facts in our test: HyperSplit is the only algorithm that can successfully handle all the rule sets; HyperSplit is also the only algorithm that reaches more than 6Gbps throughput on the Octeon3860 multi-core platform when tested with 64-byte Ethernet packets against 10K ACL rules.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061972","startPage":"648","endPage":"656","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061972.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet Classification Algorithms: From Theory to Practice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061972/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Packet Classification Algorithms: From Theory to Practice","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061972/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10685468","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet Classification Algorithms: From Theory to Practice","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-19-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064118S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5061975,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For a cognitive radio network to achieve this goal, spectrum policies and the ability to enforce them are necessary. Detection of an unauthorized (anomalous) usage is one of the critical issues in spectrum etiquette enforcement. In this paper, we present a network structure for dynamic spectrum access and formulate the anomalous usage detection problem using statistical significance testing. The detection problem is classified into two subproblems. For the case where no authorized signal is present, we describe the existing cooperative sensing schemes and investigate the impact of signal path loss on their performance. For the case where an authorized signal is present, we propose three methods that detect anomalous transmissions by making use of the characteristics of radio propagation. Analytical models are formulated for two special cases and, due to the intractability of the general problem, we present an algorithm using machine learning techniques to solve the general case. Our simulation results show that our approaches can effectively detect unauthorized spectrum usage with high detection rate and low false positive rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ALDO: An Anomaly Detection Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061975","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061975.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"ALDO: An Anomaly Detection Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061975/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685471","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ALDO: An Anomaly Detection Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-19-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091284S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5061979,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Long term characteristics are investigated both at TCP/IP layers (packet and flow attributes) and application usages. The analysis of this unique dataset provides new insights into changes in traffic statistics, notably on the persistence of Long Range Dependence, induced by the on-going increase in link bandwidth. Traffic in the MAWI dataset is subject to bandwidth changes, to congestions, and to a variety of anomalies. This allows the comparison of their impacts on the traffic statistics but at the same time significantly impairs long term evolution characterizations. To account for this difficulty, we show and explain how and why random projection (sketch) based analysis procedures provide practitioners with an efficient and robust tool to disentangle actual long term evolutions from time localized events such as anomalies and link congestions. Our central results consist in showing a strong and persistent long range dependence controlling jointly byte and packet counts. An additional study of a 24-hour trace complements the long-term results with the analysis of intraday variabilities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061979.pdf","startPage":"711","endPage":"719","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seven Years and One Day: Sketching the Evolution of Internet Traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Robustness","Statistics","Statistical analysis","Bandwidth","Long Term Evolution","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Spine","TCPIP"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","Internet","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet traffic","TCP/IP layers","longitudinal study","long range dependence","MAWI dataset","robust estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Seven Years and One Day: Sketching the Evolution of Internet Traffic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061979/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685475","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seven Years and One Day: Sketching the Evolution of Internet Traffic","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-20-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10943S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5061987,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A major challenge in this respect is the VN embedding problem that deals with efficient mapping of virtual nodes and virtual links onto the substrate network resources. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, previous research focused on designing heuristic-based algorithms which had clear separation between the node mapping and the link mapping phases. This paper proposes VN embedding algorithms with better coordination between the two phases. We formulate the VN embedding problem as a mixed integer program through substrate network augmentation. We then relax the integer constraints to obtain a linear program, and devise two VN embedding algorithms D-ViNE and R-ViNE using deterministic and randomized rounding techniques, respectively. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithms increase the acceptance ratio and the revenue while decreasing the cost incurred by the substrate network in the long run.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061987","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061987.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Network Embedding with Coordinated Node and Link Mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5061987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061987/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Network Embedding with Coordinated Node and Link Mapping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685483","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5061987/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Network Embedding with Coordinated Node and Link Mapping","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-22-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0599S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"495","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5061995,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper presents a new mobility model called SLAW (self-similar least action walk) that can produce synthetic walk traces containing all these features. This is by far the first such model. Our performance study using using SLAW generated traces indicates that SLAW is effective in representing social contexts present among people sharing common interests or those in a single community such as university campus, companies and theme parks. The social contexts are typically common gathering places where most people visit during their daily lives such as student unions, dormitory, street malls and restaurants. SLAW expresses the mobility patterns involving these contexts by fractal way points and heavy-tail flights on top of the way points. We verify through simulation that SLAW brings out the unique performance features of various mobile network routing protocols.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","startPage":"855","endPage":"863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05061995.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLAW: A New Mobility Model for Human Walks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5061995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5061995/","displayDocTitle":"SLAW: A New Mobility Model for Human Walks","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685491","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLAW: A New Mobility Model for Human Walks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-24-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.199002S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"303","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5061995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062006,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

But the distributed architecture also makes it challenging to build a highly secure and dependable yet lightweight data storage system. On the one hand, sensor data are subject to not only Byzantine failures, but also dynamic pollution attacks, as along the time the adversary may modify/pollute the stored data by compromising individual sensors. On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of WSNs precludes the applicability of heavyweight security designs. To address the challenges, we propose a novel dependable and secure data storage scheme with dynamic integrity assurance in this paper. Based on the principle of secret sharing and erasure coding, we first propose a hybrid share generation and distribution scheme to achieve reliable and fault-tolerant initial data storage by providing redundancy for original data components. To further dynamically ensure the integrity of the distributed data shares, we then propose an efficient data integrity verification scheme exploiting the technique of algebraic signatures. The proposed scheme enables individual sensors to verify in one protocol execution all the pertaining data shares simultaneously in the absence of the original data. Extensive security and performance analysis shows that the proposed schemes have strong resistance against various attacks and are practical for WSNs.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062006","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062006.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dependable and Secure Sensor Data Storage with Dynamic Integrity Assurance","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062006/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685502","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062006/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependable and Secure Sensor Data Storage with Dynamic Integrity Assurance","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-27-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088959S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5062007,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While distributed architecture enjoys a more robust and fault-tolerant wireless sensor network (WSN), such architecture also poses a number of security challenges especially when applied in mission-critical applications such as battle field and e-healthcare. First, as sensor data are stored and maintained by individual sensors and unattended sensors are easily subject to strong attacks such as physical compromise, it is significantly harder to ensure data security. Second, in many mission-critical applications, fine-grained data access control is a must as illegal access to the sensitive data may cause disastrous result and/or prohibited by the law. Last but not least, sensors usually are resource-scarce, which limits the direct adoption of expensive cryptographic primitives. To address the above challenges, we propose in this paper a distributed data access control scheme that is able to fulfill fine-grained access control over sensor data and is resilient against strong attacks such as sensor compromise and user colluding. The proposed scheme exploits a novel cryptographic primitive called attribute-based encryption (ABE), tailors, and adapts it for WSNs with respect to both performance and security requirements. The feasibility of the scheme is demonstrated by experiments on real sensor platforms. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to realize distributed fine-grained data access control for WSNs.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062007","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062007.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDAC: Toward Fine-Grained Distributed Data Access Control in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062007/","displayDocTitle":"FDAC: Toward Fine-Grained Distributed Data Access Control in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685503","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062007/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDAC: Toward Fine-Grained Distributed Data Access Control in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-27-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096645S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5062009,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The implications are heavily debated in telecom policy circles, and some advocates of \"Network Neutrality\" have opposed price based differentiation in connectivity. However, pricing content providers can possibly subsidize the end-user's cost of connectivity, and the consequent increase in end-user demand can benefit ISPs and content providers. This paper provides a framework to quantify the precise trade-off in the distribution of benefits among ISPs, content-providers, and end-users. The framework generalizes the well-known utility maximization based rate allocation model, which has been extensively studied as an interplay between the ISP and the end-users, to incorporate pricing of content-providers. We derive the resulting equilibrium prices and data rates in two different ISP market conditions: competition and monopoly. Network neutrality based restriction on content-provider pricing is then modeled as a constraint on the maximum price that can be charged to content-providers. We demonstrate that, in addition to gains in total and end- user surplus, content-provider experiences a net surplus from participation in rate allocation under low cost of connectivity. The surplus gains are, however, limited under monopoly conditions in comparison to competition in the ISP market.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062010","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062010.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Pricing and Rate Allocation with Content Provider Participation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062010/","displayDocTitle":"Network Pricing and Rate Allocation with Content Provider Participation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685506","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062010/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Pricing and Rate Allocation with Content Provider Participation","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-28-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107925S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5062011,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Open, market-based spectrum trading motivates existing spectrum owners (as sellers) to lease their selected idle spectrum to new spectrum users, and provides new users (as buyers) the spectrum they desperately need. The most significant challenge is how to make the auction economic-robust (truthful in particular) while enabling spectrum reuse to improve spectrum utilization. Unfortunately, existing designs either do not consider spectrum reuse or become untruthful when applied to double spectrum auctions. We address this challenge by proposing TRUST, a general framework for truthful double spectrum auctions. TRUST takes as input any reusability-driven spectrum allocation algorithm, and applies a novel winner determination and pricing mechanism to achieve truthfulness and other economic properties while significantly improving spectrum utilization. To our best knowledge, TRUST is the first solution for truthful double spectrum auctions that enable spectrum reuse. Our results show that economic factors introduce a tradeoff between spectrum efficiency and economic robustness.

To guarantee survivability we add additional logical links called protection edges, if necessary. This investigation has provided much insight into the structural properties of solutions to this problem and the structure of survivable logical graphs. Specifically, we present a highly simplified version of CUTSET-SMART that always provides a survivable mapping as long as G is 3-edge connected, and a survivable logical topology structure.

The fundamental idea adopted in this paper is to characterize the utility functions used in optimization problems, which motivate fairness concepts, based on a trade-off between user and system satisfaction. Here, user satisfaction is evaluated using information divergence measures that were originally used in information theory to evaluate the difference between two probability distributions. In this paper, information divergence measures are applied to evaluate the difference between the implemented resource allocation and a requested resource allocation. The requested resource allocation is assumed to be ideal in some sense from the user's point of view. Also, system satisfaction is evaluated based on the efficiency of the implemented resource utilization, which is defined as the total amount of resources allocated to each user. The results discussed in this paper indicate that the well-known fairness concept called weighted alpha-proportional fairness can be characterized using the alpha-divergence measure, which is a general class of information divergence measures, as an equilibrium of the trade-off described above. In the process of obtaining these results, we also obtained a new utility function that has a parameter to control the trade-off. This new function is then applied to typical examples to solve resource allocation problems in simple network models such as those for two-link networks and wireless LANs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062017/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685513","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Information-Theoretic Characterization of Weighted alpha-Proportional Fairness","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Information-Theoretic Characterization of Weighted alpha-Proportional Fairness","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-30-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081987S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5062035,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Each server has a time-dependent and user-dependent service rate for each user at each timeslot. A schedule specifies which server serves which user per timeslot, with a typical objective of maximizing the total rate that the users receive. The servers are numbered by a set of consecutive integers. A strict contiguity constraint enforces that each user is served by at most one contiguous interval of the servers. We show that a strict contiguity requirement makes the scheduling problem APX hard to solve, which means we cannot approximate an optimal schedule arbitrarily closely. On the positive side, we also offer two approximation algorithms, a simple one that guarantees a logarithmic approximation and a more complex one that guarantees a constant approximation. In addition, we also present a complete taxonomy of the scheduling variants that consider issues in the following dimensions, (i) Strict contiguity vs soft contiguity, where the latter allows multiple intervals of servers to serve the same user but imposes a penalty; (ii) Full buffer vs finite buffer, where the former assumes each user always has a large queue and for the latter the service a user receives is upper bounded by its queue size; (iii) slot-by-slot scheduling vs template scheduling, where the former creates a schedule for every timeslot and the latter creates a schedule for multiple timeslots at a time; (iv) Time-variant vs time-invariant service rates for template scheduling.

We propose algorithms that automatically create efficient, soft fractional frequency reuse (FFR) patterns for enhancing performance of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based cellular systems for forward link best effort traffic. The Multi- sector Gradient (MGR) algorithm adjusts the transmit powers of the different sub-bands by systematically pursuing maximization of the overall network utility. We show that the maximization can be done by sectors operating in a semi-autonomous way, with only some gradient information exchanged periodically by neighboring sectors. The Sector Autonomous (SA) algorithm adjusts its transmit powers in each sub-band independently in each sector using a non-trivial heuristic to achieve out- of-cell interference mitigation. This algorithm is completely autonomous and requires no exchange of information between sectors. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that both algorithms provide substantial performance improvements. In particular, they can improve the cell edge data throughputs significantly, by up to 66% in some cases for the MGR, while maintaining the overall sector throughput at the same level as that achieved by the traditional approach. The simulations also show that both algorithms lead the system to \"self-organize\" into efficient, soft FFR patterns with no a priori frequency planning.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062043.pdf","startPage":"1287","endPage":"1295","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Organizing Dynamic Fractional Frequency Reuse for Best-Effort Traffic through Distributed Inter-Cell Coordination","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Interference","Throughput","Telecommunication traffic","Utility programs","MIMO","Scheduling algorithm","Fading","Communications Society","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing dynamic fractional frequency reuse","best-effort traffic","distributed inter-cell coordination","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multi-sector gradient algorithm","cellular systems","sector autonomous algorithm","interference mitigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Self-Organizing Dynamic Fractional Frequency Reuse for Best-Effort Traffic through Distributed Inter-Cell Coordination","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062043/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685538","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Organizing Dynamic Fractional Frequency Reuse for Best-Effort Traffic through Distributed Inter-Cell Coordination","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-36-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093047S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062048,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The aim is to choose transmission powers for each connection so as to maximize the number of connections for which this threshold is met. We believe that analyzing this problem is important both in its own right and also because it arises as a subproblem in many other areas of wireless networking. We study both the complexity of the problem and also present some game theoretic results regarding capacity that is achieved by completely distributed algorithms. We also feel that this problem is intriguing since it involves both continuous aspects (i.e. choosing the transmission powers) as well as discrete aspects (i.e. which connections should be supported). Our results are: ldr We show that maximizing the number of supported connections is NP-hard, even when there is no background noise. This is in contrast to the problem of determining whether or not a given set of connections is feasible since that problem can be solved via linear programming. ldr We present a number of approximation algorithms for the problem. All of these approximation algorithms run in polynomial time and have an approximation ratio that is independent of the number of connections. ldr We examine a completely distributed algorithm and analyze it as a game in which a connection receives a positive payoff if it is successful and a negative payoff if it is unsuccessful while transmitting with nonzero power. We show that in this game there is not necessarily a pure Nash equilibrium but if such an equilibrium does exist the corresponding price of anarchy is independent of the number of connections. We also show that a mixed Nash equilibrium corresponds to a probabilistic transmission strategy and in this case such an equilibrium always exists and has a price of anarchy that is independent of the number of connections.

In this paper we present a framework for detecting and localizing performance anomalies based on using an active probe-enabled measurement infrastructure deployed on the periphery of a network. Our framework has three components: an algorithm for detecting performance anomalies on a path, an algorithm for selecting which paths to probe at a given time in order to detect performance anomalies (where a path is defined as the set of links between two measurement nodes), and an algorithm for identifying the links that are causing an identified anomaly on a path (i.e., localizing). The problem of detecting an anomaly on a path is addressed by comparing probe-based measures of performance characteristics with performance guarantees for the network (e.g., SLAs). The path selection algorithm is designed to enable a tradeoff between ensuring that all links in a network are frequently monitored to detect performance anomalies, while minimizing probing overhead. The localization algorithm is designed to use existing path measurement data in such a way as to minimize the number of paths necessary for additional probing in order to identify the link(s) responsible for an observed performance anomaly. We assess the feasibility of our framework and algorithms by implementing them in ns-2 and conducting a set of simulation-based experiments using several different network topologies. Our results show that our method is able to accurately detect and localize performance anomalies in a timely fashion and with lower probe and computational overheads than previously proposed methodologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Performance Anomaly Detection and Localization","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062053","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062053.pdf","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Network Performance Anomaly Detection and Localization","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062053/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685547","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Performance Anomaly Detection and Localization","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-39-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065059S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062056,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Mobile nodes in MobTorrent use the WWAN network as a control channel. When a mobile client wants to initiate a download, instead of waiting for contact with the AP, it informs one (or multiple) selected AP(s) to prefetch the content. The scheduling algorithm in MobTorrent then replicates the prefetched data on the mobile helpers so that the total amount of data transferred and the average transfer rate to the mobile clients are maximized. Therefore, instead of limiting high speed data transfer to the short contact periods between APs and mobile clients, high speed transfers among vehicles are opportunistically exploited. Evaluation based on testbed measurement and trace-driven simulation shows that MobTorrent provides substantial improvement over existing architectures. For the case of a single AP, its performance approximates that of an off-line optimal scheduler. In case of multiple APs, our evaluation shows that MobTorrent's performance is robust in a variety of settings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MobTorrent: A Framework for Mobile Internet Access from Vehicles","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062056","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062056.pdf","startPage":"1404","endPage":"1412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"MobTorrent: A Framework for Mobile Internet Access from Vehicles","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062056/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685550","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MobTorrent: A Framework for Mobile Internet Access from Vehicles","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-40-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096117S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5062057,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this application, mobile users subscribe to a dynamic-content distribution service, offered by their service provider. To improve coverage and increase capacity, we assume that users share any content updates they receive with other users they meet. We make two contributions. First, we determine how the service provider can allocate its bandwidth optimally to make the content at users as \"fresh\" as possible. More precisely, we define a global fairness objective (namely, maximizing the aggregate utility over all users) and prove that the corresponding optimization problem can be solved by gradient descent. Second, we specify a condition under which the system is highly scalable: even if the total bandwidth dedicated by the service provider remains fixed, the expected content age at each user grows slowly (as log(n)) with the number of users n. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address these two aspects (optimality and scalability) of the distribution of dynamic content over a mobile social network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685552","htmlLink":"/document/5062058/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and scalable distribution of content updates over a mobile social network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and scalable distribution of content updates over a mobile social network","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-40-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0865S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5062064,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

However, with this increased openness, the fear of rogue programs written to propagate from one phone to another becomes ever more real. This paper proposes a counter-mechanism to contain the propagation of a mobile worm at the earliest stage by patching an optimal set of selected phones. The counter-mechanism continually extracts a social relationship graph between mobile phones via an analysis of the network traffic. As people are more likely to open and download content that they receive from friends, this social relationship graph is representative of the most likely propagation path of a mobile worm. The counter mechanism partitions the social relationship graph via two different algorithms, balanced and clustered partitioning and selects an optimal set of phones to be patched first as those which have the capability to infect the most number of other phones. The performance of these partitioning algorithms is compared against a benchmark random partitioning scheme. Through extensive trace-driven experiments using real IP packet traces from one of the largest cellular networks in the US, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed counter-mechanism in containing a mobile worm.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062064","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062064.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062064","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Social Network Based Patching Scheme for Worm Containment in Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Social Network Based Patching Scheme for Worm Containment in Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062064/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685558","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Social Network Based Patching Scheme for Worm Containment in Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-42-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095391S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062069,"authors":[{"name":"B.

However, due to the limited number of radios and available orthogonal channels, designing efficient channel assignment and scheduling algorithms in such networks is a major challenge. In this paper, we present provably-good distributed algorithms for simultaneous channel allocation of individual links and packet-scheduling, in software-defined radio (SDR) wireless networks. Our distributed algorithms are very simple to implement, and do not require any coordination even among neighboring nodes. A novel access hash function or random oracle methodology is one of the key drivers of our results. With this access hash function, each radio can know the transmitters' decisions for links in its interference set for each time slot without introducing any extra communication overhead between them. Further, by utilizing the inductive-scheduling technique, each radio can also backoff appropriately to avoid collisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our bounds are valid in practice.","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062069.pdf","startPage":"1521","endPage":"1529","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Strategies for Channel Allocation and Scheduling in Software-Defined Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Strategies for Channel Allocation and Scheduling in Software-Defined Radio Networks","htmlLink":"/document/5062069/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685563","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Strategies for Channel Allocation and Scheduling in Software-Defined Radio Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-43-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090978S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062071,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Motivated by the recent 802.16j standard, we consider two sub-carrier grouping models (PUSC, AMC). While the extent of diversity gain varies depending on the model, spatial reuse is common to both the models and is crucial in delivering the promised throughput benefits of relays. Hence leveraging spatial reuse forms the prime focus of this work with diversity gains being leveraged when available. We establish the hardness of the problem under these two models and propose efficient approximation algorithms for the scheduling problem considered. Our solutions are simple to implement at the base station, while also providing worst case guarantees.

In such networks and in the absence of regenerators, the signal quality of transmission degrades due to physical layer impairments. We initially present an algorithm for solving the static RWA problem based on an LP relaxation formulation that tends to yield integer solutions. To account for signal degradation due to physical impairments, we model the effects of the path length, the path hop count, and the interference among ligthpaths by imposing additional (soft) constraints on RWA. The objective of the resulting optimization problem is not only to serve the connection requests using the available wavelengths, but also to minimize the total accumulated signal degradation on the selected lightpaths. Our simulation studies indicate that the proposed RWA algorithms select the lightpaths for the requested connections so as to avoid impairment generating sources, thus dramatically reducing the overall physical-layer blocking when compared to RWA algorithms that do not account for impairments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10685567","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062073/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impairment-Aware Offline RWA for Transparent Optical Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impairment-Aware Offline RWA for Transparent Optical Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-44-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05293S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5062077,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) is used as the quantity that determines the association. We make some surprising observations: (i) displacing a base station a little in one direction may result in a displacement of the boundary of the corresponding cell to the opposite direction; (ii) A cell corresponding to a BS may be the union of disconnected sub-cells. We then study the Stackelberg equilibrium in the combined BS location and mobile association problem: we determine where to locate the BSs so as to maximize the revenues obtained at the induced SINR mobile association game.

However a significant weakness of this approach has been in routing, because the traditional back-pressure algorithm explores and exploits all feasible paths between each source and destination. While this extensive exploration is essential in order to maintain stability when the network is heavily loaded, under light or moderate loads, packets may be sent over unnecessarily long routes and the algorithm could be very inefficient in terms of end-to-end delay and routing convergence times. This paper proposes new routing/scheduling back-pressure algorithms that not only guarantees network stability (through-put optimality), but also adaptively selects a set of optimal routes based on shortest-path information in order to minimize average path-lengths between each source and destination pair. Our results indicate that under the traditional back-pressure algorithm, the end-to-end packet delay first decreases and then increases as a function of the network load (arrival rate). This surprising low-load behavior is explained due to the fact that the traditional back-pressure algorithm exploits all paths (including very long ones) even when the traffic load is light. On the otherhand, the proposed algorithm adaptively selects a set of routes according to the traffic load so that long paths are used only when necessary, thus resulting in much smaller end-to-end packet delays as compared to the traditional back-pressure algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062086","startPage":"1674","endPage":"1682","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062086.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Combining Shortest-Path and Back-Pressure Routing Over Multihop Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Combining Shortest-Path and Back-Pressure Routing Over Multihop Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062086/","accessionNumber":"10685580","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062086/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Combining Shortest-Path and Back-Pressure Routing Over Multihop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-47-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082753S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5062088,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Firstly, for a simplified model falling in the classical Markov decision process framework where arrival and channel statistics are known, we numerically compute and evaluate the characteristics of mean-delay-optimal scheduling policies. The computed policies exhibit radial sum-rate monotonicity (RSM), i.e., when users' queues grow linearly (i.e. scaled up by a constant), the scheduler allocates service in a manner that de-emphasizes the balancing of unequal queues in favor of maximizing current system throughput (being opportunistic). This is in sharp contrast to previously proposed policies, e.g., MaxWeight and Exp rule. The latter, however, are throughput-optimal, in that without knowledge of arrival/channel statistics they achieve stability if at all feasible. To meet performance and robustness objectives, secondly, we propose a new class of policies, called the Log rule, that are radial sum-rate monotone and provably throughput optimal. Our simulations for realistic wireless channels confirm the superiority of the Log rule which achieves up to 80% reduction in mean packet delays. However, recent asymptotic analysis showed that Exp rule is optimal in terms of minimizing the asymptotic probability of max-queue overflow. In turn, in a companion paper we have shown that an RSM policy minimizes the asymptotic probability of sum-queue overflow. Finally, we use extensive simulations to explore the various possible design objectives for opportunistic schedulers. When users see heterogenous channels, we find that minimizing the worst asymptotic exponent across users may excessively compromise the overall delay. Our simulations show that only if perfectly tuned to the load will the Exp rule achieve low homogenous tails across users. Otherwise the Log rule achieves a 20-75% reduction in the 99\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n percentile for most, if not all, the users. We conclude that for wireless environments, where precise resource allocation is virtually impossible, the Log rule may be more desirable for its robust and graceful degradation to unpredicted changes.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062088","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062088.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Optimal Opportunistic Scheduling and Approximations: The Log Rule","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062088/","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Optimal Opportunistic Scheduling and Approximations: The Log Rule","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685582","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062088/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Optimal Opportunistic Scheduling and Approximations: The Log Rule","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-48-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105644S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5062089,"authors":[{"name":"P. van de Ven","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics & Computer Science, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"P.","lastName":"van de Ven","id":"37313508800"},{"name":"S.

The maximum-stability guarantees however rely on the fundamental premise that the system consists of a fixed set of sessions with stationary ergodic traffic processes. In the present paper we examine a scenario where the population of active sessions varies over time, as sessions eventually end while new sessions occasionally start. We identify a simple necessary and sufficient condition for stability, and show that MaxWeight policies may fail to provide maximum stability. The intuitive explanation is that these policies tend to give preferential treatment to flows with large backlogs, so that the rate variations of flows with smaller backlogs are not fully exploited. In the usual framework with a fixed collection of flows, the latter phenomenon cannot persist since the flows with smaller backlogs will build larger queues and gradually start receiving more service. With a dynamic population of flows, however, MaxWeight policies may constantly get diverted to arriving flows, while neglecting the rate variations of a persistently growing number of flows in progress with relatively small remaining backlogs. We also perform extensive simulation experiments to corroborate the analytical findings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062089/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10685583","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062089/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Instability of MaxWeight Scheduling Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instability of MaxWeight Scheduling Algorithms","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-48-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075785S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062093,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Our main technical contribution involves extracting, in polynomial time, a constant number of isometric and balanced tree separators from a given CUDG. We do this by extending the celebrated Lipton-Tarjan separator theorem for planar graphs to CUDGs. Our techniques extend to other classes of graphs; for example, for general graphs, we obtain an O(log n)-stretch greedy embedding into O(log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nn)-dimensional space.

Yet, traditional rateless codes usually make no use of a feedback communication channel, a feature available in many wireless settings. As such, we generalize LT codes to situations where receiver(s) provide feedback to the broadcaster. Our approach, referred to as Shifted LT (SLT) code, modifies the robust soliton distribution of LT codes at the broadcaster, based on the number of input symbols already decoded at the receivers. While implementing this modification entails little change to the LT encoder and decoder, we show both analytically and through real experiments, that it achieves significant savings in communication complexity, memory usage, and overall energy consumption. Furthermore, we show that significant savings can be even achieved with a low number of feedback messages (on the order of the square root of the total number of input symbols) transmitted at a uniform rate. The practical benefits of Shifted LT codes are demonstrated through the implementation of a real over-the-air programming application for sensor networks, based on the Deluge protocol.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rateless Coding with Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062099.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Rateless Coding with Feedback","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062099/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685593","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rateless Coding with Feedback","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-52-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07585S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062100,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We provide an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before stopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet erasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver requires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time to complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. We show that its performance is very close to that of a full duplex system, while transmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in performance, especially if latency is high. Also, we study the throughput performance of our scheme and compare it to existing half-duplex go-back-N and selective repeat ARQ schemes.

Since data in UWSNs are transmitted by acoustic signals, the characteristics of a UWSN are different from those of a terrestrial sensor network. In other words, the high propagation delay of acoustic signals in UWSNs causes spatial-temporal uncertainty, and makes transmission scheduling in UWSNs a challenging problem. Hence, in this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal MAC scheduling protocol, called ST-MAC, which is designed to overcome spatial-temporal uncertainty based on TDMA-based MAC scheduling for energy saving and throughput improvement. We construct the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">spatial-temporal</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">conflict</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">graph</i>\n (ST-CG) to describe the conflict delays among transmission links explicitly, and model ST-MAC as a new vertex coloring problem of ST-CG. We then propose a novel heuristic, called the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">traffic-based</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">one-step</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">trial</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">approach</i>\n (TOTA), to solve the coloring problem. In order to obtain the optimal solution of the scheduling problem, we also derive a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Finally, we present a comprehensive performance study via simulations. The results show that ST-MAC can perform better than existing MAC schemes (such as S-MAC, ECDiG, and T-Lohi) in terms of the network throughput and energy cost.","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062103.pdf","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1835","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ST-MAC: Spatial-Temporal MAC Scheduling for Underwater Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"ST-MAC: Spatial-Temporal MAC Scheduling for Underwater Sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/5062103/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685597","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ST-MAC: Spatial-Temporal MAC Scheduling for Underwater Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-53-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075962S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062105,"authors":[{"name":"M.

C-MAC exploits concurrent wireless channel access based on empirical power control and physical interference models. Nodes running C-MAC estimate the level of interference based on the physical signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) model and adjust the transmission power accordingly for concurrent channel access. C-MAC employs a block-based communication mode that not only amortizes the overhead of channel assessment, but also improves the probability that multiple nodes within the interference range of each other can transmit concurrently. C-MAC has been implemented in TinyOS-1.x and extensively evaluated on Tmote nodes. Our experiments show that C-MAC significantly outperforms the state-of-art CSMA protocol in TinyOS with respect to system throughput, delay and energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062105/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685599","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"C-MAC: Model-Driven Concurrent Medium Access Control for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C-MAC: Model-Driven Concurrent Medium Access Control for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-53-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144587S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5062106,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Typically, an RF tag sends an encrypted message to the reader, then the reader searches for the key that can decrypt the cipher to identify the tag. Due to the large-scale deployment of today's RFID systems, the key search scheme for any PPA requires a short response time. Previous designs construct balance-tree based key management structures to accelerate the search speed to 0(logN), where N is the number of tags. Being efficient, such approaches are vulnerable to compromising attacks. By capturing a small number of tags, compromising attackers are able to identify other tags that have not been corrupted. To address this issue, we propose an Anti- Compromising authenticaTION protocol, ACTION, which employs a novel sparse tree architecture, such that the key of every tag is independent from one another. The advantages of this design include: 1) resilience to the compromising attack, 2) reduction of key storage for tags from 0(logN) to 0(1), which is significant for resource critical tag devices, and 3) high search efficiency, which is 0(logN), as good as the best in the previous designs.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1961","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062117.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACTION: Breaking the Privacy Barrier for RFID Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Radiofrequency identification","Authentication","Protection","Radio frequency","Cryptography","Large-scale systems","Delay","Acceleration","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","message authentication","radiofrequency identification","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ACTION","privacy barrier","RFID systems","privacy protection","radio frequency identification systems","privacy-preserving authentication","dominated tags","private information","RF tag","encrypted message","short response time","balance-tree based key management structures","Anti- Compromising authenticaTION protocol","sparse tree architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"ACTION: Breaking the Privacy Barrier for RFID Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062117/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062117/","accessionNumber":"10685611","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACTION: Breaking the Privacy Barrier for RFID Systems","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-56-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074738S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5062123,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One effective method for reducing energy consumption is dynamic speed scaling, which adapts the processing speed to the current load. This paper studies how to optimally scale speed to balance mean response time and mean energy consumption under processor sharing scheduling. Both bounds and asymptotics for the optimal speed scaling scheme are provided. These results show that a simple scheme that halts when the system is idle and uses a static rate while the system is busy provides nearly the same performance as the optimal dynamic speed scaling.

However, there exists an inherent trade off between the gains in terms of probability of detection of the primary user (PU) and the costs in terms of false alarm probability. In this paper, we study the impact of this trade off on the topology and the dynamics of a network of SUs seeking to reduce the interference on the PU through collaborative sensing. Moreover, while existing literature mainly focused on centralized solutions for collaborative sensing, we propose distributed collaboration strategies through game theory. We model the problem as a non-transferable coalitional game, and propose a distributed algorithm for coalition formation through simple merge and split rules. Through the proposed algorithm, SUs can autonomously collaborate and self-organize into disjoint independent coalitions, while maximizing their detection probability taking into account the cooperation costs (in terms of false alarm). We study the stability of the resulting network structure, and show that a maximum number of SUs per formed coalition exists for the proposed utility model. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows a reduction of up to 86.6% of the average missing probability per SU (probability of missing the detection of the PU) relative to the non-cooperative case, while maintaining a certain false alarm level. In addition, through simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed distributed solution with respect to an optimal centralized solution that minimizes the average missing probability per SU. Finally, the results also show how the proposed algorithm autonomously adapts the network topology to environmental changes such as mobility.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062135","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062135.pdf","startPage":"2114","endPage":"2122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coalitional Games for Distributed Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Coalitional Games for Distributed Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062135/","accessionNumber":"10685629","publicationDate":"April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coalitional Games for Distributed Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-61-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070512S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062136,"authors":[{"name":"A.

If providers cooperate, i.e., pool their resources, such as spectrum and base stations, and agree to serve each others' customers, their aggregate payoffs, and individual shares, can potentially substantially increase through efficient utilization of resources and statistical multiplexing. The potential of such cooperation can however be realized only if each provider intelligently determines who it would cooperate with, when it would cooperate, and how it would share its resources during such cooperation. Also, when the providers share their aggregate revenues, developing a rational basis for such sharing is imperative for the stability of the coalitions. We model such cooperation using transferable payoff coalitional game theory. We first consider the scenario that locations of the base stations and the channels that each provider can use have already been decided apriori. We show that the optimum cooperation strategy, which involves the allocations of the channels and the base stations to mobile customers, can be obtained as solutions of convex optimizations. We next show that the grand coalition is stable in this case, i.e. if all providers cooperate, there is always an operating point that maximizes the providers' aggregate payoff, while offering each such a share that removes any incentive to split from the coalition. Next, we show that when the providers can choose the locations of their base stations and decide which channels to acquire, the above results hold in important special cases. Finally, we examine cooperation when providers do not share their payoffs, but still share their resources so as to enhance individual payoffs. We show that the grand coalition continues to be stable.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062136.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062136","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","startPage":"2123","endPage":"2131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Profit Sharing in Coalition Based Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Profit Sharing in Coalition Based Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062136/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685630","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Profit Sharing in Coalition Based Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-61-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102855S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062138,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, it is not clear how network coding based cooperative diversity can be exploited effectively in multi-channel networks where overhearing is not readily available. Moreover, the question of how to practically realize the promising gains available, including multi-user diversity, cooperative diversity and network coding in multi-channel networks, also remains unexplored. This work represents the first attempt to unravel these two questions. In this paper, we propose XOR-CD, a novel XOR-assisted cooperative diversity scheme in OFDMA wireless networks. It can greatly improve the relay efficiency by over 100% mostly, thus uplifting the throughput performance by over 30% compared to conventional cooperative diversity scheme. In addition, we formulate a unifying optimization framework that jointly considers relay assignment, relay strategy selection, channel assignment and power allocation to reap different forms of gains. We design efficient polynomial time algorithms to solve the NP-hard problem with provably the best approximation factor, and verify their effectiveness using realistic simulations.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062138","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062138.pdf","startPage":"2141","endPage":"2149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"XOR-Assisted Cooperative Diversity in OFDMA Wireless Networks: Optimization Framework and Approximation Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062138/","displayDocTitle":"XOR-Assisted Cooperative Diversity in OFDMA Wireless Networks: Optimization Framework and Approximation Algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685632","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062138/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"XOR-Assisted Cooperative Diversity in OFDMA Wireless Networks: Optimization Framework and Approximation Algorithms","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-61-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121366S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5062142,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In such scenarios, the traditional network-protocol paradigm of separately specifying the source identity and the message in distinct fields leads to inefficient communication. This work addresses the question of how should communication happen in such identity-aware sensor networks. We reexamine the traditional source-identity/message separation and propose a scheme for jointly encoding the two. We use this to develop a communication method for identity-aware sensor networks and show it to be energy efficient, simple to implement, and gracefully adaptable to scenarios frequently encountered in sensor networks - for instance, node failures, or large numbers of nodes where only few are active during each reporting round.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062142/","accessionNumber":"10685636","displayDocTitle":"Identity Aware Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identity Aware Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-62-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068382S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5062147,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We propose a cross-layer optimization approach to multicast video in CR networks. Specifically, we model CR video multicast as an optimization problem, while considering important design factors including scalable video coding, video rate control, spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access, modulation, scheduling, retransmission, and primary user protection. The objective is to optimize the overall received video quality as well as achieving proportional fairness among multicast users, while keeping the interference to primary users below a prescribed threshold. Although the problem can be solved using advanced optimization techniques, we propose a sequential fixing algorithm and a greedy algorithm with low complexity and proven optimality gap. Our simulations using MPEG-4 fine grained scalability (FGS) demonstrate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed approach as compared with an alternative equal allocation scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685641","htmlLink":"/document/5062147/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Video Multicast in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Video Multicast in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-64-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136894S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5062153,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is well understood that, the current practice where servers are connected by a tree hierarchy of network switches cannot meet these requirements (Fares et al., 2008 and Guo et al., 2008). In this paper, we explore a new server-interconnection structure. We observe that the commodity server machines used in today's data centers usually come with two built-in Ethernet ports, one for network connection and the other left for backup purpose. We believe that, if both ports are actively used in network connections, we can build a low-cost interconnection structure without the expensive higher-level large switches. Our new network design, called FiConn, utilizes both ports and only the low-end commodity switches to form a scalable and highly effective structure. Although the server node degree is only two in this structure, we have proven that FiConn is highly scalable to encompass hundreds of thousands of servers with low diameter and high bisection width. The routing mechanism in FiConn balances different levels of links. We have further developed a low-overhead traffic-aware routing mechanism to improve effective link utilization based on dynamic traffic state. Simulation results have demonstrated that the routing mechanisms indeed achieve high networking throughput.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062153","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062153.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FiConn: Using Backup Port for Server Interconnection in Data Centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FiConn: Using Backup Port for Server Interconnection in Data Centers","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062153/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685647","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062153/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FiConn: Using Backup Port for Server Interconnection in Data Centers","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-65-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072345S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062155,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The heterogeneity of both spectrum availability and traffic demand in secondary users has brought significant challenge for efficient spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks. Observing that spectrum resource can be better matched to traffic demand of secondary users with the help of relay node that has rich spectrum resource, in this paper we exploit a new research direction for cognitive radio networks by utilizing cooperative relay to assist the transmission and improve spectrum efficiency. An infrastructure-based secondary network architecture has been proposed to leverage relay-assisted discontiguous OFDM (D-OFDM) for data transmission. In this architecture, relay node will be selected which can bridge the source and the destination using its common channels between those two nodes. With the introduction of cooperative relay, many unique problems should be considered, especially the issue for relay selection and spectrum allocation. We propose a centralized heuristic solution to address the new resource allocation problem. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of cooperative relay for cognitive radio, a new MAC protocol has been proposed and implemented in a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)-based testbed. Experimental results show that the throughput of the whole system is greatly increased by exploiting the benefit of cooperative relay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Relay for Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062156","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062156.pdf","startPage":"2304","endPage":"2312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Relay for Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062156/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685650","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Relay for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-66-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072771S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5062158,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We propose a distributed MAC protocol for such networks that enables unlicensed users to dynamically utilize the available spectrum while limiting the imposed interference on primary (PR) users. Our proposed protocol is novel in three aspects. First, it does not require CR users to coordinate with PR users. Second, it does not assume any predefined CR-to-PR power mask, and thus can exploit the available spectrum more efficiently. Third, it provides the PR users with a statistical guarantee on the fraction of time that their reception may be corrupted by CR users. To avoid corrupting PR user receptions, the protocol computes the maximum power that a CR transmission can use based on current network conditions. We show how to compute this maximum power by deriving models for the PR-to-CR and PR-to-PR interference. Simulation experiments illustrate that our MAC protocol can satisfy the statistical guarantee for PR users under various user deployment models and traffic loads.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062158.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062158","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","startPage":"2322","endPage":"2330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Protocol Without Power Mask Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Protocol Without Power Mask Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062158/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062158/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685652","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Protocol Without Power Mask Constraints","confLoc":"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-66-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103183S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5062169,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Our proposed application differs from previous work in that they typically treat the sensor network as a media of data acquisition while in our navigation application, in-situ interactions between users and sensors become ubiquitous. In addition, human safety and time factors are critical to the success of our objective. Without any pre-knowledge of user and sensor locations, the design of an effective and efficient navigation protocol faces non-trivial challenges. We propose to embed a road map system in the sensor network without location information so as to provide users navigating routes with guaranteed safety. We accordingly design efficient road map updating mechanisms to rebuild the road map in the event of changes in dangerous areas. In this navigation system, each user only issues local queries to obtain their navigation route. The system is highly scalable for supporting multiple users simultaneously. We implement a prototype system with 36 TelosB motes to validate the effectiveness of this design.

In a cognitive radio (CR) environment, there are several key challenges that must be addressed apart from the above concerns. The intermittent spectrum sensing undertaken by the CR users, the activity of the licensed users of the spectrum, large-scale bandwidth variation based on spectrum availability, and the channel switching process need to be considered in the transport protocol design. In this paper, a window-based transport protocol for CR ad-hoc networks, TP-CRAHN, is proposed that distinguishes each of these events by a combination of explicit feedback from the intermediate nodes and the destination. This is achieved by adapting the classical TCP rate control algorithm running at the source to closely interact with the physical layer channel information, the link layer functions of spectrum sensing and buffer management, and a predictive mobility framework that is developed at the network layer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the transport layer to specifically address the concerns of the CR ad-hoc networks and our approach is thoroughly validated by simulation experiments.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062176.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062176","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","startPage":"2482","endPage":"2490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TP-CRAHN: a Transport Protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"TP-CRAHN: a Transport Protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062176/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685670","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TP-CRAHN: a Transport Protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-71-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060663S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5062180,"authors":[{"name":"H.

To match these line rates, a single router line card needs to forward more than 150 million packets per second. This requires a corresponding amount of longest prefix match operations. Furthermore, the increased use of IPv6 requires core routers to perform the longest prefix match on several hundred thousand prefixes varying in length up to 64 bits. It is a challenge to scale existing algorithms simultaneously in the three dimensions of increased throughput, table size and prefix length. Recently, Bloom filter-based IP lookup algorithms have been proposed. While these algorithms can take advantage of hardware parallelism and fast on-chip memory to achieve high performance, they have significant drawbacks (discussed in the paper) that impede their use in practice. In this paper, we present the distributed and load balanced bloom filters to address these drawbacks. We develop the practical IP lookup algorithm for use in 100 Gbps line cards. The regular and modular hardware architecture of our scheme directly maps to the state-of-art ASICs and FPGAs with reasonable resource consumption. Also, our scheme outperforms TCAMs on most metrics including cost, power dissipation, and board footprint.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062180","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062180.pdf","startPage":"2518","endPage":"2526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IPv6 Lookups using Distributed and Load Balanced Bloom Filters for 100Gbps Core Router Line Cards","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"IPv6 Lookups using Distributed and Load Balanced Bloom Filters for 100Gbps Core Router Line Cards","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062180/","accessionNumber":"10685674","publicationDate":"April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IPv6 Lookups using Distributed and Load Balanced Bloom Filters for 100Gbps Core Router Line Cards","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01-72-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045551S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062189,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Like in OFDMA downlink, it enables multiple users to be served simultaneously in uplink as well. However, its single carrier property requires that all the subcarriers allocated to a single user must be contiguous in frequency within each time slot. This contiguous allocation constraint limits the scheduling flexibility, and frequency-domain packet scheduling algorithms in such system need to incorporate this constraint while trying to maximize their own scheduling objectives. In this paper we explore this fundamental problem of LTE SC-FDMA uplink scheduling by adopting the conventional time-domain proportional fair algorithm to maximize its objective (i.e. proportional fair criteria) in the frequency-domain setting. We show the NP-hardness of the frequency-domain scheduling problem under this contiguous allocation constraint and present a set of practical algorithms fine tuned to this problem. We demonstrate that competitive performance can be achieved in terms of system throughput as well as fairness perspective, which is evaluated using 3GPP LTE system model simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proportional Fair Frequency-Domain Packet Scheduling for 3GPP LTE Uplink","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062197.pdf","startPage":"2611","endPage":"2615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Proportional Fair Frequency-Domain Packet Scheduling for 3GPP LTE Uplink","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062197/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685691","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proportional Fair Frequency-Domain Packet Scheduling for 3GPP LTE Uplink","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-04-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060008S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062199,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Most works have been limited to theory; few works in literature address the practical benefits and realizability of adaptive beamforming. In this paper, we design and implement the first indoor WLAN beamforming system with multi-element array antennas and software radio platforms, that forms a testbed for exploration of practical benefits of beamforming, and evaluation of algorithms for efficient beamforming in diverse environments. In the process of building the system, we identify and address several challenges with practical beamforming that are often ignored in theoretical works. Most importantly, channel estimation for forming the best beam to a user is hindered by oscillator drifts on the transmitter and receiver side that introduce hard-to-isolate phase and frequency offsets from the estimated channel coefficients. We describe these issues and incorporate novel solutions in our system to address them without requiring hardware modifications. We use the system to demonstrate the realizable benefits of adaptive beamforming in a typical indoor office environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685693","htmlLink":"/document/5062199/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Towards Adaptive Beamforming in Indoor Wireless Networks: An Experimental Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Adaptive Beamforming in Indoor Wireless Networks: An Experimental Approach","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-04-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073232S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062201,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A fundamental capability of all such systems is that of inter-cache coordination, which can be divided into two main types: explicit and implicit coordination. While the former allows for greater control over resource allocation, the latter does not suffer from the additional communication overhead needed for coordination. In this paper, we consider a network in which each router has a local cache that caches files passing through it. By additionally storing minimal information regarding caching history, we develop a simple content caching, location, and routing systems that adopts an implicit, transparent, and best-effort approach towards caching.

Using RDS and a previously proposed technique, namely Metropolized Random Walk (MRW) sampling, we examine the efficiency of estimating node properties in unstructured overlays and identify some of the key factors that determine the accuracy of sampling techniques. We evaluate the RDS and MRW techniques using simulation over a wide range of static and dynamic graphs as well as experiments over a widely deployed Gnutella network. Our study sheds light on how the connectivity structure among nodes and its dynamics affect the accuracy and efficiency of the two sampling techniques. Both techniques exhibit a rather similar performance over a wide range of scenarios. However, RDS significantly outperforms MRW when the overlay structure exhibits a combination of highly skewed node degrees and highly skewed (local) clustering coefficients.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062215","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062215.pdf","startPage":"2701","endPage":"2705","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Respondent-Driven Sampling for Characterizing Unstructured Overlays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Respondent-Driven Sampling for Characterizing Unstructured Overlays","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685709","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062215/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Respondent-Driven Sampling for Characterizing Unstructured Overlays","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-08-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056176S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5062233,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Structon is composed of three ideas which we realize in three corresponding steps. First, we extract geolocation information of Web server IP addresses from Web pages. Second, we devise heuristic algorithms to improve both the accuracy and the coverage of the IP geolocation database using these Web server IP addresses and their geolocations as input. Third, for those segments that are not covered in the first two steps, we use IP traceroute to identify the access routers of those segments. When the location of the access router is known, we can deduce the location of the associated segment since it is co-located together with the access router. By mining 500-million Web pages collected in China in 2006 (11 percent of the total Web pages in China at that time), we are able to identify the geolocations for 103 million IP addresses. This represents nearly 88 percent IP addresses allocated to China in March 2008. Structon is 87.4 percent accurate at city granularity and up to 93.5 percent accurate at province level. We also used 10 day Windows Live client log to evaluate our client IP addresses coverage: Structon identified geolocations of 98.9 percent of client IP addresses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062243/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062243/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10685737","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Mining the Web and the Internet for Accurate IP Address Geolocations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining the Web and the Internet for Accurate IP Address Geolocations","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-13-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045425S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5062248,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A recent work has shown that PCA is very sensitive to calibration settings. Unfortunately, the authors did not provide further explanations for this observation. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide the reasoning behind the found discrepancies. We revisit PCA for anomaly detection and evaluate its performance on our data. We develop a slightly modified version of PCA that uses only data from a single router. Instead of correlating data across different spatial measurement points, we correlate the data across different metrics. With the help of the analyzed data, we explain the pitfalls of PCA and underline our argumentation with measurement results. We show that the main problem is that PCA fails to capture temporal correlation. We propose a solution to deal with this problem by replacing PCA with the Karhunen-Loeve transform. We find that when we consider temporal correlation, anomaly detection results are significantly improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying PCA for Traffic Anomaly Detection: Problems and Solutions","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062248","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062248.pdf","startPage":"2866","endPage":"2870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Applying PCA for Traffic Anomaly Detection: Problems and Solutions","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062248/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685742","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying PCA for Traffic Anomaly Detection: Problems and Solutions","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-14-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047239S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5062249,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this band, the use of narrow beams is essential for attaining the required link ranges in order to overcome the higher path loss at mm wave carrier frequencies. However, highly directional links make standard MAC methods for interference management, such as carrier sense multiple access, which rely on neighboring nodes hearing each other, become inapplicable. In this paper, we study the extent to which we can reduce, or even dispense with, interference management, by exploiting the reduction in interference due to the narrow beamwidths and the oxygen absorption characteristic of the 60 GHz band. We provide a probabilistic analysis of the interference incurred due to uncoordinated transmissions, and show that, for the parameters considered, the links in the network can be thought of as pseudo-wired. That is, interference can essentially be ignored in MAC design, and the challenge is to schedule half-duplex transmissions in the face of the \"deafness\" resulting from highly directional links. We provide preliminary simulation results to validate our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685743","htmlLink":"/document/5062249/","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Medium Access Control for 60 GHz Outdoor Mesh Networks with Highly Directional Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium Access Control for 60 GHz Outdoor Mesh Networks with Highly Directional Links","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-15-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.524151S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062251,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We propose a novel angular interference model, which is not only practical, but also makes the problem of TDMA scheduling tractable.

However, its delay performance may be quite poor even when the traffic load is not close to network capacity due to the following two reasons. First, each node has to maintain a separate queue for each commodity in the network, and only one queue is served at a time. Second, the backpressure routing algorithm may route some packets along very long routes. In this paper, we present solutions to address both of the above issues, and hence, improve the delay performance of the back-pressure algorithm. One of the suggested solutions also decreases the complexity of the queueing data structures to be maintained at each node.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5061888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062262","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061887/5061888/05062262.pdf","startPage":"2936","endPage":"2940","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Architectures and Algorithms for Delay Reduction in Back-Pressure Scheduling and Routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel Architectures and Algorithms for Delay Reduction in Back-Pressure Scheduling and Routing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062262/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685756","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062262/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Architectures and Algorithms for Delay Reduction in Back-Pressure Scheduling and Routing","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-17-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05558S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5062264,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, the effectiveness of active-measurement techniques depends on being able to deploy measurement hosts at appropriate locations, and to inject necessary amounts of probe traffic without impacting the performance of interest. On the other hand, existing passive-measurement methods like [1] require router support and suffer from deployment limitations for the foreseeable future. In this paper, we propose a new estimation technique that does not require any new router features or measurement infrastructure, and only uses the sampled flow level statistics that are routinely collected in operational networks. The technique is designed to handle challenges of sampled flow-level aggregation such as information aggregation and non-alignment of flow records with measurement intervals. We develop three different schemes and derive analytical bounds on the variance of loss estimation from such a flow-based approach. Our analysis shows that link data rates are now becoming sufficiently large to counteract the effects on sampling on estimation accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062264/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685758","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On Passive One-Way Loss Measurements Using Sampled Flow Statistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Passive One-Way Loss Measurements Using Sampled Flow Statistics","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"02-18-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086757S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061887","isNumber":"5061888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061887","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5061888","articleId":"5062264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5062267,"authors":[{"name":"K.

First, leveraging node position diversity through scheduling yields large improvements in channel utilization. Second, STUMP does not require tight node synchronization to achieve high channel utilization, allowing nodes to use simple or more energy efficient synchronization protocols.

Recently, optically reconfigurable gate arrays (ORGAs) with a holographic memory were developed. They realize rapid reconfigurations and numerous reconfiguration contexts. Furthermore, optically differential reconfigurable gate arrays (ODRGAs) have been developed to accelerate optical reconfigurations of conventional ORGAs. However, fast configuration experiments under multiple contexts exploiting the ODRGA architecture have never been reported. Therefore, this paper presents a four-context ODRGA system and experimental results demonstrating its fast reconfiguration. The advantage of the ODRGA architecture is discussed based on those results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Four-Context Optically Differential Reconfigurable Gate Array","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2024173","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5224043/05062295.pdf","startPage":"4460","endPage":"4470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2024173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Four-Context Optically Differential Reconfigurable Gate Array","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"20","htmlLink":"/document/5062295/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10860174","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Four-Context Optically Differential Reconfigurable Gate Array","sourcePdf":"jlt-mwatanabe-2024173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065395S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5224043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5224043","articleId":"5062295","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5062296,"authors":[{"name":"Aashish Shah","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Materials Joining, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6104/5161435/5062296/5062296-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aashish Shah received the B.Tech. degree from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, in 2002 and the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

However, the ultrasound level required for Cu is approximately 1.3 times than that required for Au. Consequently, about 30% higher ultrasonic forces induced to the bonding pad are measured using integrated real-time microsensors. The accompanying higher stresses increase the risk of under-pad damage. One way to reduce ultrasonic bonding stresses is by choosing the softer of the two Cu wire types, resulting in a measured ultrasonic force reduction of about 5%. A second way is to reduce the ultrasound level. While this causes the average shear strength to fall by 15%, the ultrasonic force falls by 9%.

Control strategies aiming at achieving proper sharing of the voltage and/or current at the input or output sides are studied in detail. The relationship between sharing of input voltages/currents and that of output voltages/currents is studied. In particular, the inherent stability of control operations applied at the input side and the output side is analyzed. Based on the analysis, a general control strategy for series-parallel systems, which decouples the output voltage control loop and the sharing control loop, is proposed. Furthermore, three modularization architectures are proposed for input-series-output-parallel (ISOP), input-parallel-output-series (IPOS), and input-series-output-series (ISOS) connected systems. These architectures enjoy full advantages of modularization and no external controller is needed to coordinate the sharing control for the individual modules. Experimental prototypes are built and tested to validate the general control strategy and the proposed modularization architectures.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4939357/05062315.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939357","startPage":"1463","endPage":"1474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC/DC Conversion Systems Consisting of Multiple Converter Modules: Stability, Control, and Experimental Verifications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DC/DC Conversion Systems Consisting of Multiple Converter Modules: Stability, Control, and Experimental Verifications","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712667","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062315/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC/DC Conversion Systems Consisting of Multiple Converter Modules: Stability, Control, and Experimental Verifications","sourcePdf":"tpel-chen-2012406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058782S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4939357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"244","xplore-issue":"4939357","articleId":"5062315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5062321,"authors":[{"name":"Bozhi Yang","affiliation":["Infinia Corporation, Kennewick, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5062320/5062321/5062321-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bozhi Yang received the B.S. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1997, the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2006, with thesis research on creation and modeling of MEMS fluid control devices.","At Carnegie Mellon, he also developed surface-tension-based microdevices, humidity sensors, and viscosity sensors for glucose monitoring.

The device features a series of compliant membranes that form deformable walls of a microchannel. For an incoming pulsatile flow, passive vibrations of the membranes allow the fluid to be accumulated for an overflow and discharged for an underflow, resulting in drastically reduced fluctuations in flow rate and pressure. A lumped-parameter model is developed to simulate the device characteristics, in which the coupling of membrane vibrations and fluid flow in individual channel sections associated with a single membrane is first represented by squeeze-film theory and inertia-free structural dynamics. The entire device is next represented as a system by connecting individual channel sections in series. The model is numerically solved, and the results agree with experiments. The theoretical and experimental results both show that a five-membrane device can stabilize a pulsating flow by a factor of about 20. These results also reveal that smaller average flow rate, smaller fluctuation, and higher fluctuation frequency lead to more effective flow stabilization. With these characteristics, the flow stabilizer can be used to obtain steady flow in microfluidic systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compliance-Based Microflow Stabilizer","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2021826","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5062320/05062321.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2021826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Compliance-Based Microflow Stabilizer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5062321/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712738","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compliance-Based Microflow Stabilizer","sourcePdf":"jmems-lin-2021826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048052S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5062320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5062320","articleId":"5062321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062331,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Optimality of competing VR topologies, such as conventional (Conv) buck, coupled inductor, and extended duty ratio converters, is examined using efficiency norms and a new cost-per-watt metric to compare the amount of output capacitance (which is strongly correlated to the VR cost) to the efficiency. Coupled inductors provide a higher steady-state inductance than transient inductance. Lower transient inductance allows for smaller output capacitance. However, lower output capacitance requires a higher switching frequency and thus yields greater switching losses and lower efficiency. Extended duty ratio mechanisms reduce the switching voltage, and hence, reduce switching losses and increase efficiency. Experimental data are provided that the coupled inductor extended duty ratio converter has the same average efficiency, has higher light-load efficiency, and uses one-third of the output capacitance as the Conv multiphase buck converter. Hence, the combination of multiwinding coupled inductors and extended duty ratio mechanisms is shown to be the optimal VR configuration. The optimality concepts contributed in this paper resolve the ambiguity between VR cost and efficiency, and are essential for selecting the best solution among several competing VR designs. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2013223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4939357/05062425.pdf","startPage":"1494","endPage":"1505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2013223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939357","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage Regulator Optimization Using Multiwinding Coupled Inductors and Extended Duty Ratio Mechanisms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Voltage Regulator Optimization Using Multiwinding Coupled Inductors and Extended Duty Ratio Mechanisms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062425/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712670","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage Regulator Optimization Using Multiwinding Coupled Inductors and Extended Duty Ratio Mechanisms","sourcePdf":"tpel-oraw-2013223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035316S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4939357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"28","articleId":"5062425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5062429,"authors":[{"name":"Catalin Borcia","affiliation":["Department of Plasma Physics, Al.I.Cuza University, Iasi, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/5062427/5062429/5062429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Catalin Borcia received the B.S. degree from the Al.

The problem is formulated as the definition of the element clustering into spatially contiguous subarrays and the corresponding weights to obtain a pattern with the lowest (i.e., minimum achievable) sidelobe level (SLL). The problem is addressed with an unconstrained approach based on an excitation matching method where the synthesis of subarray weights and sizes is simultaneously carried out. Successively, a hybrid version of such an approach is proposed to directly enforce into the optimization procedure the SLL constraints. A set of representative results concerned with both sum and difference patterns are shown.

Since these evanescent waves contain the finest spatial details of the source, the image suffers a loss of resolution and is referred to as ldquodiffraction-limited.rdquo Superlensing is the ability to create an image with fine features beyond the diffraction limit, and can be achieved with a ldquoVeselago-Pendryrdquo lens made from a metamaterial. Such a Veselago-Pendry superlens for imaging in free space must be stringently designed to restore both propagating and evanescent waves, but meeting these design conditions (isotropic \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n = epsiv\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n = mu\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n = -1) has proven difficult and has made its realization elusive. We demonstrate free-space imaging with a resolution over three times better than the diffraction limit at microwave frequencies using a Veselago-Pendry metamaterial superlens based on the negative-refractive-index transmission-line (NRI-TL) approach, which affords precise control over its properties and is also less susceptible to losses than other approaches. A microwave superlens can be particularly useful for illumination and discrimination of closely spaced buried objects over practical distances by way of back-scattering, e.g., in tumour or landmine detection, or for targeted irradiation over electrically small regions in tomography/hyperthermia applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-Space Imaging Beyond the Diffraction Limit Using a Veselago-Pendry Transmission-Line Metamaterial Superlens","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2019890","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5062486/05062500.pdf","startPage":"1720","endPage":"1727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2019890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Free-Space Imaging Beyond the Diffraction Limit Using a Veselago-Pendry Transmission-Line Metamaterial Superlens","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5062500/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712910","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-Space Imaging Beyond the Diffraction Limit Using a Veselago-Pendry Transmission-Line Metamaterial Superlens","sourcePdf":"57tap06-eleftheriades-2019890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046041S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5062486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5062486","articleId":"5062500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5062501,"authors":[{"name":"Gokhan Mumcu","affiliation":["ElectroScience Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5062486/5062501/5062501-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gokhan Mumcu (s'03) was born on March 30, 1982 in Bursa, Turkey.

The proposed beamforming algorithm uses a sequentially perturbation gradient estimation method to update the control voltages of the phase shifters, with the objective of maximizing the received power by the array. This algorithm does not require either the knowledge of phase shifter characteristics or signal direction-of-arrival. Moreover, in this paper, the algorithm parameters are derived for the stationary and mobile platform configurations. For the stationary array, it is shown how the proper selection of the beamforming parameters limits the noise effects and increases the array output power. For the mobile array, a condition for the fast convergence is derived and the advantage of using nonuniform step size to update the control voltages is illustrated. When phase shifters suffer from the imbalanced insertion loss the proposed beamforming technique perturbs the phase-conjugate condition to increase the total received power. This algorithm has been implemented with the low-cost microwave components and applied to a Ku-band phased array antenna with 34 sub-arrays. The experimental results verify the broadband performance, and the fast convergence of the algorithm for different platform maneuvers.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2019911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5062486/05062512.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2019911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Beamforming for Mobile Satellite Receiver Phased Arrays: Theory and Experiment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast Beamforming for Mobile Satellite Receiver Phased Arrays: Theory and Experiment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062512/","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5062512/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712921","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Beamforming for Mobile Satellite Receiver Phased Arrays: Theory and Experiment","sourcePdf":"57tap06-mfakharzadeh-2019911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108802S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5062486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5062486","articleId":"5062512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5062515,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Klemm","affiliation":["Centre of Communications Research, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5062486/5062515/5062515-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maciej Klemm was born in 1978.

The array consists of 16 UWB aperture-coupled stacked-patch antennas located on a section of a hemisphere. The radar system is designed to be used with realistic three-dimensional (3D) breast phantoms, which have been developed, as well as with real breast cancer patients during initial clinical trials. Images are formed using two different beamforming algorithms and the performance of these algorithms is firstly compared through numerical simulation. Experimental results for the same beamforming techniques are then presented, demonstrating the successful detection of 4 and 6 mm diameter spherical tumors in the curved breast phantom.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062515/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","volume":"57","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10712923","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5062515/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radar-Based Breast Cancer Detection Using a Hemispherical Antenna Array\u2014Experimental Results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar-Based Breast Cancer Detection Using a Hemispherical Antenna Array\u2014Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"57tap06-mklemm-2019856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129344S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5062486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"287","xplore-issue":"5062486","articleId":"5062515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5062520,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37311125400"},{"name":"Wei Hong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hong","id":"37277098600"},{"name":"Zhenqi Kuai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenqi","lastName":"Kuai","id":"37318202800"},{"name":"Junfeng Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309894300"},{"name":"Haiming Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292552300"},{"name":"Jixin Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jixin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280683400"},{"name":"Hongjun Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Tang","id":"37289159900"},{"name":"Jianyi Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianyi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291307800"},{"name":"Ke Wu","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique, University of Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278659100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5062520","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4062},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062520","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless communication","Antenna measurements","Antenna arrays","Directive antennas","Slot antennas","Azimuth","Butler matrix","Antenna feeds","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multibeam antennas","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam antenna","substrate integrated waveguide technology","MIMO wireless communications","24-beams slot array antenna","multiple input multiple output wireless communications","Butler matrix","low side lobe level","amplitude distribution","frequency 16 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam-forming","Butler matrix","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)"]}],"abstract":"A 24-beams slot array antenna, which achieves 360-degrees coverage over azimuth direction, based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology is designed, fabricated and measured for supporting the concept of triangle cell, beam diversity and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless communications.

We formulate the ADI technique for use in tunnels with rectangular, circular and arched cross sections and with lossy walls. The electrical parameters of the lossy walls are characterized by an equivalent surface impedance. A vector PE is also formulated for use in tunnels with lossy walls. It is shown that the ADI is more computationally efficient than the Crank Nicolson method. However, boundary conditions become more difficult to model. The boundary conditions of the ADI intermediate planes are given the same boundary conditions as the physical plane and the overall accuracy is reduced. Also, when implementing the ADI in tunnels with circular cross sections the order at which the line by line decomposition occurs becomes important. To validate the ADI-PE, we show simulation results for tunnel test cases with known analytical solutions. Furthermore, the ADI-PE is used to simulate real tunnels in order to compare with experimental data. It is shown that the PE models the electric fields most accurately in real tunnels at large distances, where the lower order modes dominate.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2019891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5062486/05062523.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2019891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062486","startPage":"1759","endPage":"1770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ADI-PE Approach for Modeling Radio Transmission Loss in Tunnels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An ADI-PE Approach for Modeling Radio Transmission Loss in Tunnels","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712909","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5062523/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ADI-PE Approach for Modeling Radio Transmission Loss in Tunnels","sourcePdf":"57tap06-rjanaswamy-2019891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082636S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5062486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5062486","articleId":"5062523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5062526,"authors":[{"name":"Terence S.

The antenna printed on a printed circuit board (PCB) slab consists of two notched triangular radiating elements with two feeding ports. A ground plane is etched on the reverse side of the PCB. The shape of the ground plane is optimized to improve the isolation between the ports as well as impedance matching. The simulated and measured results show that across the operating bandwidth, the antenna can achieve a broad impedance bandwidth with good performance in terms of isolation of < -20 dB, average gain of > -2 dBi, and efficiency of > 70%. The correlation between the radiation patterns shows consistent diversity performance across the UWB bandwidth. A method to derive thetransfer function of the antenna has been proposed, which can be used to obtain the radiated pulses in the time domain. Furthermore, a parametric study is conducted to provide antenna engineers with useful information for designing and optimizing the antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5062486/05062526.pdf","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2019908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2019908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ultrawideband Diversity Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Ultra wideband antennas","Bandwidth","Frequency diversity","Antenna feeds","Printed circuits","Slabs","Etching","Shape","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","diversity reception","microstrip antennas","mobile antennas","printed circuits","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrawideband diversity antenna","portable devices","printed antenna","printed circuit board","PCB slab","notched triangular radiating element","feeding port","impedance matching","radiation patterns","transfer function","time domain analysis","frequency 3.1 GHz to 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity","portable devices","ultrawideband (UWB) antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Ultrawideband Diversity Antenna","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5062526/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712932","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ultrawideband Diversity Antenna","sourcePdf":"57tap06-tsee-2019908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048464S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5062486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5062486","articleId":"5062526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5062527,"authors":[{"name":"Wim Aerts","affiliation":["Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) Group, Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), TELEMIC Division, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5062486/5062527/5062527-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wim Aerts was born in Wilrijk, Belgium, in 1978.

A smooth control circuit (SCC) is proposed to ensure the stable transition from the constant-current (CC) to the constant-voltage (CV) stage. Due to the external parasitic resistance of the Li-ion battery-pack system, the charger circuit switches from the CC to the CV stage without fully charging the cell. The BRC technique dynamically estimates the external resistance to extend the CC stage. The experimental results show that the period of the CC stage can be extended to 40% of that of the original design. The charging time is effectively reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5410062/05062557.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2023830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2023830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Li-Ion Battery Charger With Smooth Control Circuit and Built-In Resistance Compensator for Achieving Stable and Fast Charging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Switches","Voltage","Protection","Switching circuits","Manufacturing","Cellular phones","Personal digital assistants","Degradation","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","electric resistance","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium-ion battery charger","smooth control circuit","built-in resistance compensator","stable charging","fast charging","resistance compensator technique","constant current","constant voltage","external parasitic resistance","Li"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Built-in resistance compensator (BRC)","charger","fast charging","Li-ion cell","smooth control circuit (SCC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5062557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Li-Ion Battery Charger With Smooth Control Circuit and Built-In Resistance Compensator for Achieving Stable and Fast Charging","volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5062557/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11105804","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Li-Ion Battery Charger With Smooth Control Circuit and Built-In Resistance Compensator for Achieving Stable and Fast Charging","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chen-2023830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079352S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5410062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5410062","articleId":"5062557","onlineDate":"02 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5066451,"authors":[{"name":"Meiko Jensen","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute of IT Security, Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Meiko","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37310179000"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Schwenk","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute of IT Security, Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Schwenk","id":"37317810500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3572-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3564-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5066451","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floods","Service oriented architecture","Computer crime","TCPIP","Credit cards","Availability","Access control","Application software","Software engineering","Thumb"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accountability problem","flooding attack","service-oriented architecture","Denial-of-Service attack threat","network-based service security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["accountability","service-oriented architecture","flooding attacks","Denial of Service","Web Services"]}],"abstract":"The threat of Denial of Service attacks poses a serious problem to the security of network-based services in general.

In large-scale computing clusters, component failures become norms instead of exceptions, caused by the ever-increasing system complexity. VM construction and reconfiguration is a potent tool for efficient online system maintenance and failure resilience. In this paper, we study how VM-based HPC clusters benefits from failure prediction in resource management for dependable computing. We consider both the reliability and performance status of compute nodes in making selection decisions. We define a capacity-reliability metric to combine the effects of both factors, and propose the Best-fit algorithm to find the best qualified nodes on which to instantiate VMs to run user jobs. We have conducted experiments using failure traces from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HPC clusters. The results show the enhancement of system dependability by using our proposed strategy with practically achievable accuracy of failure prediction. With the Best-fit strategies, the job completion rate is increased by 10.5% compared with that achieved in the current LANL HPC cluster. The task completion rate reaches 82.5% with improved utilization of relatively unreliable nodes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive Resource Management for Failure Resilient High Performance Computing Clusters","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","doi":"10.1109/ARES.2009.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066393/5066394/05066481.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARES.2009.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5066394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5066481","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5066481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Resource Management for Failure Resilient High Performance Computing Clusters","conferenceDate":"16-19 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5066481/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10690453","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive Resource Management for Failure Resilient High Performance Computing Clusters","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"3564a257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083162S","chronDate":"16-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066393","isNumber":"5066394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066393","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5066394","articleId":"5066481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5066482,"authors":[{"name":"Mourad Elhadef","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Elhadef","id":"37296313200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3572-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3564-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5066482","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Broadcasting","Ad hoc networks","Performance evaluation","System testing","Network topology","Polynomials","Availability","Computer network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","graph theory","perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptron neural network","asymmetric comparison-based system-level fault diagnosis","interconnected independent heterogeneous nodes","undirected comparison graph","perceptron-based diagnosis algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault tolerance","System-level diagnosis","Multiprocessor systems","Comparison models","Neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5066482","abstract":"The system-level fault diagnosis problem aims at answering the very simple question \"Who's faulty and who's fault-free?\", in systems known to be diagnosable. In this paper, we answer such a question using neural networks. Our objective is to identify faulty nodes based on an input syndrome that has been generated using the asymmetric comparison model. In such a model, the system, which is composed of interconnected independent heterogeneous nodes, is modeled using an undirected comparison graph. Tasks are assigned to pairs of nodes and the results of executing these tasks are compared. Based on the agreements and disagreements among the nodes' outputs, the diagnosis algorithm must identify faulty nodes. In general, it is assumed that faults are permanent, and that at most t nodes can fail simultaneously. The new solution we introduce in this paper uses a perceptron neural network to solve the fault identification problem. The neural network is first trained using various input syndromes with known fault sets. Extensive simulations have been conducted next using randomly generated diagnosable systems. Surprisingly, the neural network was able to identify all the millions of faulty situations we have tested, including those that are unlikely to occur. Simulations results indicate that the perceptron-based diagnosis algorithm is a viable addition to present diagnosis problems.","doi":"10.1109/ARES.2009.137","startPage":"265","endPage":"272","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARES.2009.137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5066394","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066393/5066394/05066482.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Perceptron Neural Network for Asymmetric Comparison-Based System-Level Fault Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5066482/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Perceptron Neural Network for Asymmetric Comparison-Based System-Level Fault Diagnosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5066482/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10690454","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Perceptron Neural Network for Asymmetric Comparison-Based System-Level Fault Diagnosis","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"3564a265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059684S","chronDate":"16-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066393","isNumber":"5066394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066393","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5066394","articleId":"5066482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5066491,"authors":[{"name":"Pin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Pin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37307286100"},{"name":"Xiangwei Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiangwei","lastName":"Kong","id":"37276443500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3572-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3564-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5066491","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":448},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5066491","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Statistics","Digital images","Feature extraction","Image processing","Computer vision","Image segmentation","Testing","Pattern matching","Transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image fusion","image matching","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital image tamper detection","feature fusion","image processing software development","feature statistics extraction","camera","one-class classifier training","image sliding segmentation","feature pattern matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital forensics","feature fusion","image forensic","image tampering","tampering detection"]}],"abstract":"Along with the development of sophisticated image processing software, it is getting easier forging a digital image but harder to detect it.

These feature statistics are used for training a one-class classifier in order to get the feature pattern of the given camera. Then, we do sliding segmentation to testing images. Finally, feature statistics extracted from image blocks are fed into the trained one-class classifier to match the feature pattern of the given camera. The images with low percentage of matched blocks are classified as tampered ones.

To embed a watermark bit into a triplet, the standard deviation of triplet coefficients magnitude is set to zero for zero bit or increased for a one bit. Three constant are used to increase the standard deviations of a triplet coefficients. The value of these constants affects the robustness of algorithm and the quality of image. To specify the optimal values for constants a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is used.

Our approach takes into account not only the NFC-subsystem but also software components that can be controlled through the NFC-interface. Through our testing approach, we were able to identify a number of previously unknown vulnerabilities, some of which can be exploited for spoofing of tag content, an NFC-based worm, and for denial-of-service attacks.

Conventional heuristic AND/OR tree search algorithms expand nodes in only a descending order of heuristic evaluation values. However, since the evaluation values are heuristic, a solution node group sometimes includes nodes with lower evaluation values. The tree which has a solution node group including nodes with lower evaluation values requires a long time to be solved by the conventional algorithms. The proposed algorithm allows us to search paths including nodes with lower evaluation values and paths including nodes with higher evaluation values concurrently. For searching various paths concurrently, the proposed algorithm uses pseudo-threads and a pseudo-thread scheduler managed by a user program with low overhead compared with the OS thread management. The pseudo-thread scheduler can weight the amount of search on each path and schedule the pseudo-threads. The proposed algorithm can solve trees which have solutions including nodes with lower evaluation values also quickly. For performance evaluation, the proposed algorithm was applied to a Tsume-Shogi (Japanese chess problem) solver as a typical AND/OR tree search problem. In tsume-shogi, players can reuse captured pieces.

SWCNN has better performance than CNN. One of weak points of SWCNN is fault tolerance. We proposed multiple SWCNN layers in order to improve fault tolerance of SWCNN.

The difficulty to define the filtering rules lies where normal and anomaly packets have to be distinguished in incoming packets. The purpose of our research is to explore the early detective method for anomaly accesses based on statistic analysis. In this paper, we defined the chi-square method, and then analyze the all amount of incoming packets to our College focusing on the source IP address using chi-square method. As the results, we were able to extract the following features. Firstly, the number of packets was the more suitable scale of the window in the chi-square method than the time scale. Secondly, the setting of the window size with 500 packets and 2 bins made the detection of the DoS attacks within 10 minutes for DNS packets possible. Finally, we verified that the DoS attacks from the same source IP address was detected using the chi-square method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066710/5066711/05066799.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"292","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2009.116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2009.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5066711","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5066799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of Characteristics of Anomaly Accessed IP Packets Using Chi-square Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Educational institutions","Computer crime","Filtering","Web server","Intrusion detection","Information security","Network servers","Testing","Competitive intelligence","Software systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","IP networks","statistical analysis","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP packet","chi-square method","denial of service attack","access filtering mechanism","intrusion detection system","statistic analysis","DoS attack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DoS attacks","Chi-square method","Anomaly access","DNS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5066799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of Characteristics of Anomaly Accessed IP Packets Using Chi-square Method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5066799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10702163","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of Characteristics of Anomaly Accessed IP Packets Using Chi-square Method","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"3575a287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04138S","chronDate":"16-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066710","isNumber":"5066711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066710","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5066711","articleId":"5066799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5066865,"authors":[{"name":"Monika Lanzenberger","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Lanzenberger","id":"37318074800"},{"name":"Jennifer Sampson","affiliation":["EPSIS, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Sampson","id":"37308809300"},{"name":"Markus Rester","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rester","id":"37318076400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3575-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5066865","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":700},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Data visualization","Tree graphs","Resource description framework","Switches","Competitive intelligence","Software systems","Software tools","Shape","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","ontologies (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ontology visualization tool","graph visualization","ontologies","ontology engineering","ontology mapping","information visualization","Web application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information Visualzation","Ontology","Alignment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5066865","abstract":"With a literature study we found an enormous number of ontology visualization tools.

Multilateration, as a basic building block of localization, however, has not yet overcome the challenges of 1) poor ranging measurements; 2) dynamic and noisy environments; and 3) fluctuations in wireless communications. Hence, multilateration-based approaches often suffer from poor accuracy and can hardly be employed in practical applications. In this study, we propose Quality of Trilateration (QoT) that quantifies the geometric relationship of objects and ranging noises. Based on QoT, we design a confidence-based iterative localization scheme, in which nodes dynamically select trilaterations with the highest quality for location computation. To validate this design, a prototype network based on wireless sensor motes is deployed and the results show that QoT well represents trilateration accuracy, and the proposed scheme significantly improves localization accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5066966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","volume":"21","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"11206083","publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5066966/","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Trilateration: Confidence-Based Iterative Localization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of Trilateration: Confidence-Based Iterative Localization","sourcePdf":"ttd2010050631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061782S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5439161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"5439161","articleId":"5066966","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5066989,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Mashad Nemati","affiliation":["Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/5066989/5066989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Mashad Nemati (S'07) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1980.

By partitioning the entire symbol buffer into four separate parts with a special low-conflict access control strategy, the symbol deinterleaver can be implemented with four-bank single-port on-chip memory blocks with slight overhead. The experimental result shows that 30% savings of hardware cost can be achieved compared with the conventional double-buffer approach. In addition, a lookahead online circuit of a symbol permutation-address generator is also proposed, which can provide the required permutation addresses every cycle to avoid either the use of a lookup table or an extra temporary buffer. Being the major part of the entire DVB forward-error-correction decoder, the proposed symbol deinterleaver can contribute a great saving of the overall decoder cost.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5453312/05067007.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5453312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multibank Memory-Based VLSI Architecture of DVB Symbol Deinterleaver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067007/","displayDocTitle":"A Multibank Memory-Based VLSI Architecture of DVB Symbol Deinterleaver","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11260226","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067007/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multibank Memory-Based VLSI Architecture of DVB Symbol Deinterleaver","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ychang-2015456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082693S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5453312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5453312","articleId":"5067007","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5067008,"authors":[{"name":"Jinjin He","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5453312/5067008/5067008-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinjin He (S'08) was born in Nanjing, China, in 1981.

Effect of eddy current damper with different shapes and fixed positions are studied in a seven-bulk YBaCuO levitation system over the permanent magnet guideway (PMG). Similarly to the direct optimizations of the HTS-PMG system, this method is able to improve the damping performance of the HTS Maglev vehicle system without changing other performance. On the other hand, the drag force caused by eddy current damper has been discussed and analysed, which is regarded as a possible technical obstacle for the practical HTS Maglev application.

The voltage traces measured on the conduit (jacket) of these conductors during tests, give V-I characteristics that significantly differ from the typical transition from the superconducting to the resistive state measured on single strands. In these measurements, after an initial ramping of the transport current up to the test value, the temperature is increased by steps until the resistive transition occurs. However, even in the first phase of the current ramping, when the cable is still fully or almost superconductive, early voltages are measured along the jacket at different angular positions around the cable. In particular, this was observed in the ITER TF conductors recently tested in the SULTAN facility at Villigen PSI, Switzerland. These samples showed significant ramps of voltages taken in the proximity of the joints and terminations.

The test program includes a series of tests at various speeds, field currents and temperatures (65 K-77 K) with the machine in open circuit to determine the critical currents of the HTS rotor, the waveform and harmonic characteristics of generated voltage at different levels of iron saturation. Stationary measurements of the rotor critical current are carried out using dc current in the stator windings to quantify the influence of stator field on the performance of the superconducting winding.

Model building allows the information contained in the 2-D and 3-D time series to be presented in a more useful and concise form than the raw image data. This is particularly relevant as the trend in biology tends more and more towards high-throughput applications, and the resulting increase in the amount of acquired image data makes visual inspection impractical. The intelligent acquisition system uses an active learning approach to choose the acquisition regions that let us build our model most efficiently, resulting in a shorter acquisition time, as well as a reduction of the amount of photobleaching and phototoxicity incurred during acquisition. We validate our methodology by modeling object motion within a cell. For intelligent acquisition, we propose a set of algorithms to evaluate the information contained in a given acquisition region, as well as the costs associated with acquiring this region in terms of the resulting photobleaching and phototoxicity and the amount of time taken for acquisition. We use these algorithms to determine an acquisition strategy: where and when to acquire, as well as when to stop acquiring. Results, both on synthetic as well as real data, demonstrate accurate model building and large efficiency gains during acquisition.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2024580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5200729/05067288.pdf","startPage":"2071","endPage":"2084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2024580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Acquisition and Learning of Fluorescence Microscope Data Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067288/","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Acquisition and Learning of Fluorescence Microscope Data Models","volume":"18","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816695","pubMedId":"19502128","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067288/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Acquisition and Learning of Fluorescence Microscope Data Models","sourcePdf":"18tip09-cjackson-2024580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072838S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5200729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5200729","articleId":"5067288","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5067295,"authors":[{"name":"Francesca Bovolo","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5165149/5067295/5067295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesca Bovolo (S'05\u2013M'07) received the Laurea (B.S.) and the Laurea Specialistica (M.S.) degrees (summa cum laude) in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information technologies from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2001, 2003, and 2006, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral member with the Remote Sensing Laboratory, Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento.

In particular, according to an experimental analysis driven from a theoretical study, the main effects of RN on VHR images are identified and some important properties are derived and described in a polar framework for change vector analysis. In addition, a technique for an adaptive and unsupervised explicit estimation of the RN distribution in the polar domain is proposed. This technique derives the RN distribution according to both a multiscale analysis of the distribution of spectral change vectors and the Parzen windows method. Experimental results obtained on simulated and real multitemporal data sets confirm the validity of the proposed analysis, the reliability of the derived properties on RN, and the effectiveness of the proposed estimation technique. This technique represents a very promising tool for the definition of change-detection methods for VHR multitemporal images robust to RN.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Adaptive Estimation of the Registration Noise Distribution in Multitemporal VHR Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2017014","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5165149/05067295.pdf","startPage":"2658","endPage":"2671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2017014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Adaptive Estimation of the Registration Noise Distribution in Multitemporal VHR Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5067295/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764039","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Adaptive Estimation of the Registration Noise Distribution in Multitemporal VHR Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bruzzone-2017014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081858S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5165149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5165149","articleId":"5067295","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5067297,"authors":[{"name":"Kwan-Jung Oh","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechatronics, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwan-Jung","lastName":"Oh","id":"37309213700"},{"name":"Sehoon Yea","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sehoon","lastName":"Yea","id":"37313522500"},{"name":"Anthony Vetro","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Vetro","id":"37274798600"},{"name":"Yo-Sung Ho","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechatronics, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yo-Sung","lastName":"Ho","id":"37289814300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5067297","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":869},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067297","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Sampling methods","Image reconstruction","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image sampling","Image coding","Layout","Signal processing algorithms","TV","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image sampling","rendering (computer graphics)","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth reconstruction filter","3D video depth coding","depth image-based rendering","3D video system","depth down/up sampling techniques","rendering quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D video","depth down/up sampling","depth reconstruction filter","free viewpoint television (FTV)"]}],"abstract":"A depth image represents three-dimensional (3-D) scene information and is commonly used for depth image-based rendering (DIBR) to support 3-D video and free-viewpoint video applications.

This paper therefore proposes a generic compensation scheme to accommodate the effects of such converter nonlinearities and, in doing so, improve the harmonic quality of the machine phase currents.

Different studies have focused on the assessment of pantograph control systems, addressing actuator configurations and control strategies, mainly by means of numerical experiments. In the last few years, it has become possible to transfer the knowledge gained from numerical experiments to real operating conditions. Due to the high cost of on-track tests, which are necessary for the final assessment of active pantograph performances, it is desirable to perform these tests on a system that has already demonstrated its capabilities with less expensive laboratory tests, in which at least the basic features of the real operating conditions are reproduced. This paper deals with the development of a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test rig, which allows the reproduction of the dynamical interaction between the overhead lines and the pantograph in high-speed railways. The HIL test rig makes it possible to verify the control strategies, the electrical drive configurations for active control, and the contact force estimation procedures on a real pantograph under conditions that are similar to those encountered on the real line. Some examples of test bench applications for pantograph active control and contact force estimation are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2023632","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05067305.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2023632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"4071","endPage":"4078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-in-the-Loop Overhead Line Emulator for Active Pantograph Testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-in-the-Loop Overhead Line Emulator for Active Pantograph Testing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067305/","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5067305/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869395","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-in-the-Loop Overhead Line Emulator for Active Pantograph Testing","sourcePdf":"tie-mauri-2023632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106906S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5067305","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5067306,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquin J.

Second, with multiple receiving coils, the power delivery to an individual receiver is less sensitive to changes in the loads attached to other coils. By using a 16 cm by 18 cm primary and a 6 cm by 8 cm secondary coil, going from a 1:2 coupling to a 2:2 coupling, we show an increase in received power from 1.8 to 9.5 W, with only a small change in coupling efficiency.

By imposing a structural assumption on the unknown input distribution vector, the observability of the disturbance with respect to the output is safeguarded, and the disturbance can be estimated from the sliding surface. Under a Lipschitz condition for the nonlinear part, the nonlinear observers are designed under the structural assumption that the system is observable with respect to any input. In the sliding mode, the disturbance under an equivalent control becomes an increment of Lipschitzian function, and the convergence of the estimation error dynamics can be proven similar to the analysis of HGOs. The proposed technique can be applied for fault detection and isolation. The simulation results for the bioreactor application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5200775/05067309.pdf","startPage":"3386","endPage":"3393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2023636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2023636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Gain Observers With Sliding Mode for State and Unknown Input Estimations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","State estimation","Nonlinear systems","Robustness","Observability","Sliding mode control","Convergence","Estimation error","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","nonlinear control systems","observability","observers","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-gain observers","sliding mode control","state estimation","nonlinear system","scalar disturbance","nonlinear vector","structural assumption","observability","Lipschitz condition","estimation error dynamics","fault detection","fault isolation","bioreactor application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-gain observers (HGOs)","nonlinear transformation","sliding-mode observers (SMOs)","unknown input estimations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-Gain Observers With Sliding Mode for State and Unknown Input Estimations","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5067309/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816628","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Gain Observers With Sliding Mode for State and Unknown Input Estimations","sourcePdf":"tie-veluvolu-2023636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160688S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5200775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5200775","articleId":"5067309","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5067311,"authors":[{"name":"Wojciech Sleszynski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Control Engineering, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5067311/5067311-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wojciech Sleszynski received the M.Sc. degree in control engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Faculty of Electrical and Control Engineering, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland, in 2000 and 2007.","Since 2001, he has been with the Faculty of Electrical and Control Engineering, Gdansk University of Technology, where he is currently an Assistant Professor.

Its hardware implementation becomes essential in many cases where real-time execution is needed. However, impulsive noise affects the proper operation of the filter and the adaptation process. This noise is one of the most damaging types of signal distortion, not always considered when implementing algorithms, particularly in specific hardware platforms. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are used widely for real-time applications where timing requirements are strict. Nowadays, two main design processes can be followed for embedded system design, namely, a hardware description language (e.g., VHDL) and a high-level synthesis design tool. This paper proposes the FPGA implementation of an adaptive algorithm that is robust to impulsive noise using these two approaches. Final comparison results are provided in order to test accuracy, performance, and logic occupation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5711419/05067312.pdf","startPage":"860","endPage":"870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of an Adaptive Filter Robust to Impulsive Noise: Two Approaches","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2023641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2023641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of an Adaptive Filter Robust to Impulsive Noise: Two Approaches","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11804976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5067312/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of an Adaptive Filter Robust to Impulsive Noise: Two Approaches","sourcePdf":"tie-rosadomunoz-2023641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081067S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5711419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5711419","articleId":"5067312","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5067318,"authors":[{"name":"Tam\u00e1s Kerekes","affiliation":["Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5662271/5067318/5067318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tam\u00e1s Kerekes (S'06\u2013M'09) was born in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 1978.

In addition, additional capacitors are added as voltage dividers for the two phases for reducing the voltage stress of active switches and diodes, which enables one to adopt lower voltage rating devices to further reduce both switching and conduction losses. Furthermore, the corresponding model is also derived, and analysis of the steady-state characteristic is made to show the merits of the proposed converter. Finally, a 200-W rating prototype system is also constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter. It is seen that an efficiency of 93.3% can be achieved when the output power is 150-W and the output voltage is 200-V with 0.56 duty ratio.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5463268/05067325.pdf","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2024100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2024100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Efficiency High Step-Up Converter With Low Switch Voltage Stress for Fuel-Cell System Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Switching converters","Low voltage","Stress","Diodes","Analog-digital conversion","Topology","Degradation","Electromagnetic interference","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","fuel cell power plants","power capacitors","switching convertors","voltage dividers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-efficiency high step-up converter","low switch voltage stress","fuel-cell system applications","two-phase version configuration","Cuk-type converter","voltage dividers","voltage stress reduction","active switches","power 150 W","power 200 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuel cell","high step-up converter","interleaved control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A High-Efficiency High Step-Up Converter With Low Switch Voltage Stress for Fuel-Cell System Applications","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5067325/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11286135","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Efficiency High Step-Up Converter With Low Switch Voltage Stress for Fuel-Cell System Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-pan-2024100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071467S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5463268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"5463268","articleId":"5067325","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":5067326,"authors":[{"name":"Lotfi Mostefai","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Japan","Mohamed Boudiaf University of Science and Technology of Oran, Oran, Algeria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5067326/5067326-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lotfi Mostefai received the M.S. degree in electrical control engineering in 2002.

To enhance the tracking performance of the robot joint, a dynamic model is derived from the local physical properties of friction. The model is the basis of a precompensator taking into account the dynamics of the overall corrected system by means of a minor loop. The proposed structure does not claim to faithfully reproduce complex phenomena driven by friction. However, the linearity of the local models simplifies the design and implementation of the observer, and its estimation capabilities are improved by the nonlinear integral gain. The controller can then be robustly synthesized using linear matrix inequalities to cancel the effects of inexact friction compensation. Experimental tests conducted on a robot joint with a high level of friction demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy observer-based control strategy for tracking system trajectories when operating in zero-velocity regions and during motion reversals.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2024101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"3832","endPage":"3839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2024101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05067326.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Robust control","Fuzzy control","Friction","Robots","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Linearity","Control system synthesis","Linear matrix inequalities","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","friction","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities","nonlinear control systems","observers","optimal control","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control design","robust fuzzy friction compensation","robot joint structure","nonlinear friction","linear matrix inequalities","fuzzy observer-based control strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Friction compensation","fuzzy modeling","fuzzy observers","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","optimal $H_{ \\infty}$ control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Control Design for Robust Fuzzy Friction Compensation in a Robot Joint","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067326/","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5067326/","accessionNumber":"10869404","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Control Design for Robust Fuzzy Friction Compensation in a Robot Joint","sourcePdf":"tie-mostefai-2024101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073481S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5067326","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5067327,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Constructive algorithms provide an attractive automatic way of determining a near-optimal ANN architecture for a given problem. Several such algorithms have been proposed in the literature and shown their effectiveness. This paper presents a new constructive algorithm (NCA) in automatically determining ANN architectures. Unlike most previous studies on determining ANN architectures, NCA puts emphasis on architectural adaptation and functional adaptation in its architecture determination process. It uses a constructive approach to determine the number of hidden layers in an ANN and of neurons in each hidden layer. To achieve functional adaptation, NCA trains hidden neurons in the ANN by using different training sets that were created by employing a similar concept used in the boosting algorithm. The purpose of using different training sets is to encourage hidden neurons to learn different parts or aspects of the training data so that the ANN can learn the whole training data in a better way. In this paper, the convergence and computational issues of NCA are analytically studied. The computational complexity of NCA is found to be <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$O(W \\times P_{t} \\times \\tau)$</tex></formula>, where <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$W$</tex></formula> is the number of weights in the ANN, <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$P_{t}$</tex></formula> is the number of training examples, and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\tau$</tex></formula> is the number of training epochs. This complexity has the same order as what the backpropagation learning algorithm requires for training a fixed ANN architecture. A set of eight classification and two approximation benchmark problems was used to evaluate the performance of NCA. The experimental results show that NCA can produce ANN architectures with fewer hidden neurons and better generalization ability compared to existing constructive and nonconstructive algorithms. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2021849","startPage":"1590","endPage":"1605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2021849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238715","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5238715/05067327.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Constructive Algorithm for Architectural and Functional Adaptation of Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067327/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Constructive Algorithm for Architectural and Functional Adaptation of Artificial Neural Networks","volume":"39","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5067327/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10879857","pubMedId":"19502131","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Constructive Algorithm for Architectural and Functional Adaptation of Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-islam-2021849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192068S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5238715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5238715","articleId":"5067327","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5067332,"authors":[{"name":"Vineetha Kalavally","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, School of Engineering, MONASH University, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5224043/5067332/5067332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vineetha Kalavally (M'06) received the B.Tech. degree (first class honors) in electrical electronics engineering from the Regional Engineering College, Calicut, India, in 1991 and the M.Sc. degree in communications from the University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K., in 2001.

Recently, as a way to alleviate some of the detrimental features of continuously pumped Raman amplifiers, pulsed pumping was introduced. In this paper, we study the RIN transfer in pulse-pumped fiber Raman amplifiers. An analytical expression describing RIN transfer from a pump with an arbitrary pulse shape has been derived for co- and counter-pumping configurations. The dependence of RIN transfer on pump modulation frequency, depth of modulation, and duty cycle in a typical 80-km fiber span has been analyzed for pumps with sinusoidal and rectangular profiles. We show that in the case of rectangular pulsing of pump, RIN transfer in counter-pumping regime is substantially enhanced compared with that of continuous wave (CW) pumping due to the presence of resonant peaks at the pump intensity harmonics. In the co-propagation regime, RIN transfer for pulsed pumping does not exhibit resonant peaks and is generally lower than that for CW pumping. These features are reflected on the Q-penalty and may have detrimental effects on the system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5067332/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10860189","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"20","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Study of RIN Transfer in Pulse-Pumped Raman Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Study of RIN Transfer in Pulse-Pumped Raman Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jlt-irukhlenko-2024628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079404S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5224043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5224043","articleId":"5067332","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5067334,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry M.

We present a method for controlling a tendon-driven continuum manipulator by means of specifying the shape configuration. The basis for control is a linear beam configuration model that transforms beam configuration to tendon displacement by modeling internal loads of the compliant system. An essential aspect of this model is the inclusion of both the mechanical and geometrical coupling among serial articulating sections. Important capabilities of this model are the general forward kinematics and the decoupled inverse kinematics that allow for independent control of multiple sections.

Linearization of the dynamics of the pendubot about this equilibrium results in a completely controllable system and allows a linear controller to be designed for local asymptotic stability. For the underactuated pendubot, the important task is, therefore, to design a controller that will swing up both links and bring the configuration variables of the system within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. This paper provides a new method for swing-up control based on a series of rest-to-rest maneuvers of the first link about its vertically upright configuration. The rest-to-rest maneuvers are designed such that each maneuver results in a net gain in energy of the second link. This results in swing-up of the second link and the pendubot configuration reaching the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. A four-step algorithm is provided for swing-up control followed by stabilization. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2009.2022427","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5191252/05067337.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"982","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2009.2022427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Swing-Up Control of the Pendubot: An Impulse\u2013Momentum Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Swing-Up Control of the Pendubot: An Impulse\u2013Momentum Approach","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10805356","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5067337/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Swing-Up Control of the Pendubot: An Impulse\u2013Momentum Approach","sourcePdf":"tro-mukherjee-2022427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075115S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5191252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5191252","articleId":"5067337","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5067339,"authors":[{"name":"Symeon Nikolaou","affiliation":["Frederick University, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5191308/5067339/5067339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Symeon (Simos) Nikolaou (M'08) received the B.S.E.C.E. degree from the National Technical University of Greece (NTUA) Athens, Greece, in 2003 and the M.S.E.C.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech), Atlanta, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.","Since September 2007, he has been a Lecturer at Frederick University, Nicosia Cyprus.

The first antenna uses a lambda/2 long, U-shaped slot and the second antenna uses two symmetrically placed lambda/4 long, inverted L-shaped stubs as resonating elements. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches are used to activate and deactivate the resonating elements without the need of dc bias lines due to a novel design of the switch geometry. Transmission line models and surface current distributions are used to explain the effect of the added resonating elements. Reflection coefficient radiation pattern and gain measurements are presented to verify the design concepts featuring a very satisfactory performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10805955","htmlLink":"/document/5067339/","displayDocTitle":"UWB Elliptical Monopoles With a Reconfigurable Band Notch Using MEMS Switches Actuated Without Bias Lines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB Elliptical Monopoles With a Reconfigurable Band Notch Using MEMS Switches Actuated Without Bias Lines","sourcePdf":"tap-nikolaou-2024450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065912S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5191308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5191308","articleId":"5067339","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5067340,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Sun","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5230340/5067340/5067340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mei Sun received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the Hunan University and Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2007, all in electronic engineering.","From 2006 to 208, she worked at NTU.

The comparison is based on a computational resource analysis, inversion of synthetic data, and inversion of experimentally collected data from both the Fresnel and UPC Barcelona data sets. All inversion results are blind, but appropriate physical values for the reconstructed contrast are maintained. The data sets used to test the algorithms vary widely in terms of the background media, antennas, and far/near field considerations. To ensure that the comparison is replicable, an automatic regularization parameter selection method is used for the additive regularization within the DBIM, which utilizes a fast implementation of the L-curve method and the Laplacian regularizer. While not used in the classical DBIM, we introduce an MR term to the DBIM in order to provide comparable results to MR-CSI. The introduction of this MR term requires only slight modifications to the classical DBIM algorithm, and adds little computational complexity. The results show that with the addition of the MR term in the DBIM, the two algorithms provide very similar inversion results, but with the MR-CSI method providing advantages for both computational resources and ease of implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2024478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2024478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191308","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5191308/05067347.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Microwave imaging","Biomedical imaging","Electromagnetic scattering","Inverse problems","Image reconstruction","Biology computing","Microwave theory and techniques","Magnetic analysis","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical imaging","inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distorted born iterative method","multiplicative-regularized contrast source inversion method","transverse magnetic microwave","data sets","biomedical electromagnetic imaging","electromagnetic scattering inverse problems","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical electromagnetic imaging","electromagnetic scattering inverse problems","inverse problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of an Enhanced Distorted Born Iterative Method and the Multiplicative-Regularized Contrast Source Inversion method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067347/","volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5067347/","accessionNumber":"10805975","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of an Enhanced Distorted Born Iterative Method and the Multiplicative-Regularized Contrast Source Inversion method","sourcePdf":"tap-gilmore-2024478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118566S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5191308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5191308","articleId":"5067347","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5067349,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Gang Wang","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5191308/5067349/5067349-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Gang Wang (M'04) was born in Guangdong province, China.

To accurately model the EM wave propagation, we (1) use the ray tracing method to obtain the multi-paths and (2) rigorously obtain the dyadic path loss factor model from which a novel stochastic path loss model that is flexible for both the environments with PEC walls and that with infinite thick lossless dielectric walls is devised. Using the proposed model, we successfully analyze mutual coupling effects on the 3D correlation of a 2-by-2 monopole array and the indoor channel capacity of a 20-by-20 planar array and a 20-by-20 icosahedron array.

The idea is to modify the circuit analog absorber method without perturbing the bandwidth. This is done by utilizing the asymptotic behavior of such an absorber at low frequency and replacing the band-stop resonating frequency selective surfaces with low-pass capacitive ones, which can be synthesized by square patches. It is shown that higher frequencies are not influenced by these modifications. A thin wideband capacitive circuit absorber (CCA) is presented with 28% reduction of thickness and 57% increase of bandwidth in comparison to the Salisbury screen. It is also explained why some optimized metamaterial designs fail to compete with the CCA method. For high permittivity layers, it is shown that the CCA is a better solution than the Jaumann absorber and improvements both in thickness and bandwidth are possible. A three layered ultrawideband CCA is presented with total thickness of 15.1 mm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitive Circuit Method for Fast and Efficient Design of Wideband Radar Absorbers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2024490","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5191308/05067356.pdf","startPage":"2307","endPage":"2314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2024490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Capacitive Circuit Method for Fast and Efficient Design of Wideband Radar Absorbers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5067356/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10805978","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitive Circuit Method for Fast and Efficient Design of Wideband Radar Absorbers","sourcePdf":"57tap08-azadeh-2024490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04015S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5191308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"5191308","articleId":"5067356","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5067357,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5191308/5067357/5067357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenjie Xu received the B.E. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2003 and the M.S. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich (ETHZ), Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, in 2006.","She is currently a Graduate Research Assistant with the Wireless Communication Research Group, Michigan Technological University, Houghton.

Traditional image content protection schemes use extrinsic approaches, such as watermarking or fingerprinting. However, under many circumstances, extrinsic content protection is not possible. Therefore, there is great interest in developing forensic tools via intrinsic fingerprints to solve these problems. Source coding is a common step of natural image acquisition, so in this paper, we focus on the fundamental research on digital image source coder forensics via intrinsic fingerprints. First, we investigate the unique intrinsic fingerprint of many popular image source encoders, including transform-based coding (both discrete cosine transform and discrete wavelet transform based), subband coding, differential image coding, and also block processing as the traces of evidence. Based on the intrinsic fingerprint of image source encoders, we construct an image source coding forensic detector that identifies which source encoder is applied, what the coding parameters are along with confidence measures of the result.

For such antennas, the effectiveness of passive matching is severely limited by gain-bandwidth theory, which predicts narrow bandwidths and/or poor gain. With receivers, the inability to resolve this impedance mismatch results in poor signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, as compared to using a full-size antenna. With transmitters, the consequence is poor power efficiency. However, in many applications full-size antennas are impractical, and a means is required to effectively match their electrically-small counterparts. This paper presents the technique of non-Foster impedance matching, which employs active networks of negative inductors and capacitors to bypass the restrictions of gain-bandwidth theory. We first review the origins and development of non-Foster impedance matching, and then present experimental results for the non-Foster impedance matching of electrically-small dipoles and monopoles. For receivers, our best measurements on the antenna range demonstrate up to 20 dB improvement in S/N over 20-120 MHz; for transmitters, we show a power efficiency improvement which exceeds a factor of two over an 5% bandwidth about 20 MHz with an average signal power of 1 W to the radiation resistance.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2024494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5191308/05067360.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2024494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191308","startPage":"2230","endPage":"2241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Foster Impedance Matching of Electrically-Small Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Foster Impedance Matching of Electrically-Small Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10805953","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5067360/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Foster Impedance Matching of Electrically-Small Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-sussmanfort-2024494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058074S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5191308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"5191308","articleId":"5067360","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5067369,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The MVDR beamformer can be used for both speech dereverberation and noise reduction. This paper provides new insights into the MVDR beamformer. Specifically, the local and global behavior of the MVDR beamformer is analyzed and novel forms of the MVDR filter are derived and discussed. In earlier works it was observed that there is a tradeoff between the amount of speech dereverberation and noise reduction when the MVDR beamformer is used. Here, the tradeoff between speech dereverberation and noise reduction is analyzed thoroughly. The local and global behavior, as well as the tradeoff, is analyzed for different noise fields such as, for example, a mixture of coherent and non-coherent noise fields, entirely non-coherent noise fields and diffuse noise fields. It is shown that maximum noise reduction is achieved when the MVDR beamformer is used for noise reduction only. The amount of noise reduction that is sacrificed when complete dereverberation is required depends on the direct-to-reverberation ratio of the acoustic impulse response between the source and the reference microphone. The performance evaluation supports the theoretical analysis and demonstrates the tradeoff between speech dereverberation and noise reduction. When desiring both speech dereverberation and noise reduction, the results also demonstrate that the amount of noise reduction that is sacrificed decreases when the number of microphones increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067369/","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5067369/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10940126","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New Insights Into the MVDR Beamformer in Room Acoustics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Insights Into the MVDR Beamformer in Room Acoustics","sourcePdf":"17tasl07-ehabets-2024731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074655S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5286797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5286797","articleId":"5067369","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5067373,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Wei Qu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shi-Wei","lastName":"Qu","id":"37287711200"},{"name":"Chi-Hou Chan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Hou","lastName":"Chan","id":"37280781600"},{"name":"Quan Xue","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37280402500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5067373","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2733},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Ultra wideband antennas","Microstrip antennas","Frequency","Broadband antennas","Connectors","Impedance matching","Stripline","Parametric study","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","baluns","microstrip antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["folded sectorial bowtie antenna","FSBA","ultrawideband composite cavity-backed antenna","SMA connector","parallel stripline","microstrip line","cup-shaped one","balun","stable radiation pattern","operating frequency band","antenna feed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bowtie antennas","cavity-backed antennas","unidirectional patterns","UWB antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067373","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2024585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","abstract":"A composite cavity-backed folded sectorial bowtie antenna (FSBA) is proposed and investigated in this paper, which is differentially fed by an SMA connector through a balun, i.e. a transition from a microstrip line to a parallel stripline.

Previously constructed artificial neural network user models, reported in the literature, map individual playing characteristics to reported entertainment preferences for augmented-reality game players. An adaptive mechanism then adjusts controllable game parameters in real time in order to improve the entertainment value of the game for the player. The basic approach presented here applies gradient ascent to the user model to suggest the direction of parameter adjustment that leads toward games of higher entertainment value. A simple rule set exploits the derivative information to adjust specific game parameters to augment the entertainment value. Those adjustments take place frequently during the game with interadjustment intervals that maintain the user model's accuracy. Performance of the adaptation mechanism is evaluated using a game survey experiment. Results indicate the efficacy and robustness of the mechanism in adapting the game according to a user's individual playing features and enhancing the gameplay experience. The limitations and the use of the methodology as an effective adaptive mechanism for entertainment capture and augmentation are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2024533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2024533","startPage":"121","endPage":"133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804728/5200752/05067382.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Game Adaptation for Optimizing Player Satisfaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Game Adaptation for Optimizing Player Satisfaction","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10816392","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5067382/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Game Adaptation for Optimizing Player Satisfaction","sourcePdf":"tciaig-gyannakakis-2024533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125702S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"5200752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5200752","articleId":"5067382","onlineDate":"05 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5067385,"authors":[{"name":"Yuantao Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuantao","lastName":"Gu","id":"37273848200"},{"name":"Jian Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Jin","id":"37311136000"},{"name":"Shunliang Mei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shunliang","lastName":"Mei","id":"37276289600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5067385","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":335,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2838},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Clustering algorithms","System identification","Cost function","Adaptive filters","Adaptive algorithm","Convergence","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["l0 norm constraint LMS algorithm","least mean square algorithm","adaptive algorithm","sparse system identification","approximating approach","cost function","partial updating method","adaptive filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":[" $l_{0}$ norm","adaptive filter","least mean square (LMS)","sparsity"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the performance of least mean square (LMS) based system identification of sparse systems, a new adaptive algorithm is proposed which utilizes the sparsity property of such systems.

In this context, we have been investigating wireless technologies that provide extremely high data rates through the use of narrow-beam free space optical (FSO) and/or radio-frequency (RF) point-to-point links. The use of directional wireless communications to form flexible backbone networks, which provide broadband connectivity to capacity- limited wireless networks or hosts using omnidirectional transmission, promises to circumvent the scalability limitations of traditional flat wireless networks. We have been investigating backbones of base stations, in which topologies and mobility can be controlled for purposes of assured communications. We refer to these as Directional Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (DMANET). Our work considers the use of topology control to assure robust end-to-end broadband connectivity in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. Topology control is defined as the autonomous network capability to dynamically reconfigure its physical topology. In the case of directional wireless backbone (DWB) networks, the physical topology can be reconfigured through: Autonomous 1) Topology Reconfiguration (ATR): dynamic redirection of point-to-point links using heuristic algorithms for creating new topologies and pointing, acquisition and tracking of links. Topology reconfiguration algorithms, which compute minimum energy configurations by determining optimal link assignments between backbone nodes, are presented. The pointing, acquisition and tracking (PAT) process needed to physically redirect point-to-point links is also addressed. 2) Mobility Control (MC): dynamic reposition and \"morphing\" of backbone nodes. In this model, communication links define physical interactions between network nodes. Control mechanisms are designed to mimic physical systems' natural reaction to external excitations, which drive the network topology to minimum energy configurations Using both ATR and MC, networks are completely selforganizing. They can autonomously adapt their physical topology to maximize coverage to terminals or hosts while maintaining robust backbone connectivity. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of our novel approaches to autonomous reconfiguration and control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2009","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067399/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10714169","volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous reconfiguration and control in directional mobile ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous reconfiguration and control in directional mobile ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"10-26-09mcas02-milner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091053S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"5067389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5067389","articleId":"5067399","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5067400,"authors":[{"name":"Barathram Ramkumar","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7384/5067389/5067400/5067400-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Barathram ramkumar received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Idaho State University in 2007.

Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an important component that improves the overall performance of the cognitive radio. Most modulated signals exhibit the property of cyclostationarity that can be exploited for the purpose of classification. In this paper, AMCs that are based on exploiting the cyclostationarity property of the modulated signals are discussed. Inherent advantages of using cyclostationarity based AMC are also addressed. When the cognitive radio is in a network, distributed sensing methods have the potential to increase the spectral sensing reliability, and decrease the probability of interference to existing radio systems.

The split-link three-leg topology (with six switches) suffers from poor DC voltage utilization compared with the four-leg topology (with eight switches). The four-leg topology has an electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) difficulty because it imposes large-amplitude high-frequency voltages between the DC-link busbars and ground. To obtain both good dc voltage utilization and good EMC performance, it is proposed to use a split-link inverter with an active balancing circuit (also eight switches). The balancing circuit is used to modulate the DC busbar offset voltage to make better use of the available DC-link voltage. The optimum voltage term is established to be a third harmonic term, and the DC voltage utilization is improved. A deadbeat controller supplemented with a repetitive controller is designed to give good tracking and good disturbance rejection for the busbar offset voltage. System performance is studied through an experimental test rig.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2013351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939357","startPage":"1562","endPage":"1569","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4939357/05067413.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2013351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing Voltage Utilization in Split-Link, Four-Wire Inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Circuit topology","Network topology","Switches","Electromagnetic compatibility","Voltage control","Distributed control","Switching circuits","System performance","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["busbars","control system synthesis","distributed power generation","electromagnetic compatibility","invertors","power conversion harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase four-wire inverter","distributed generation","split-link four-leg split-link inverter topology","electromagnetic compatibility","DC-link busbars","deadbeat controller design","third-harmonic voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Busbar offset modulation","dc link","four-wire inverter","repetitive control","voltage utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Increasing Voltage Utilization in Split-Link, Four-Wire Inverters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10727781","publicationDate":"June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing Voltage Utilization in Split-Link, Four-Wire Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-liang-2013351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066496S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4939357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"60","articleId":"5067413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5067418,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Kumatani","affiliation":["IDIAP Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland","Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, Intelligent Sensor-Actuator Systems (ISAS), University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5067414/5067418/5067418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kenichi Kumatani received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Kobe University, Kobe, Japan, in 1999 and the M.E. degree from the graduate school of information science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Nara, Japan, in 2001.","In 2001, he was an intern in the ATR Spoken Language Translation Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan, where he was engaged in audio\u2013visual speech recognition. from 2001 to 2004, he worked for SHARP Corporation in Japan. from September of 2004 to June of 2007, he worked with the Interactive Systems Labs at the University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, where he has worked on far-field speech recognition and addressed the speech separation challenge supported by the European Union under Augmented Multi-Party Interaction (AMI) and Pattern Analysis, Statistical Modeling and Computational Learning (PASCAL) projects. for the next year, he was with the Idiap Research Institute, Martigniy, Switzerland.

After the position of the speaker is estimated by a speaker tracking system, we construct a subband-domain beamformer in generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) configuration. In contrast to conventional practice, we then optimize the active weight vectors of the GSC so as to obtain an output signal with maximum negentropy (MN). This implies the beamformer output should be as non-Gaussian as possible. For calculating negentropy, we consider the Gamma and the generalized Gaussian (GG) pdfs. After MN beamforming, Zelinski postfiltering is performed to further enhance the speech by removing residual noise. Our beamforming algorithm can suppress noise and reverberation without the signal cancellation problems encountered in the conventional beamforming algorithms. We demonstrate this fact through a set of acoustic simulations. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of our proposed technique through a series of far-field automatic speech recognition experiments on the Multi-Channel Wall Street Journal Audio Visual Corpus (MC-WSJ-AV), a corpus of data captured with real far-field sensors, in a realistic acoustic environment, and spoken by real speakers. On the MC-WSJ-AV evaluation data, the delay-and-sum beamformer with postfiltering achieved a word error rate (WER) of 16.5%. MN beamforming with the Gamma pdf achieved a 15.8% WER, which was further reduced to 13.2% with the GG pdf, whereas the simple delay-and-sum beamformer provided a WER of 17.8%. To the best of our knowledge, no lower error rates at present have been reported in the literature on this automatic speech recognition (ASR) task.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2015090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5067414/05067418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2015090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067414","startPage":"994","endPage":"1008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming With a Maximum Negentropy Criterion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming With a Maximum Negentropy Criterion","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10713576","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5067418/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming With a Maximum Negentropy Criterion","sourcePdf":"17tasl04-kkumatani-2015090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114427S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5067414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5067414","articleId":"5067418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5067420,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Tsao","affiliation":["Spoken Language Communication Group, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5067414/5067420/5067420-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Tsao (S'04\u2013M'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2008.","His research interests focus on detection-based speech recognition, noise robustness, speaker adaptation, and speaker recognition."]},"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Tsao","id":"37311610300"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5067414/5067420/5067420-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Hui Lee (S'78\u2013M'82\u2013SM'91\u2013F'97) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 1973, the M.S. degree in engineering and applied science from Yale University, New Haven, CT, in 1977, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering with a minor in statistics from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1981.","He is a Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.

The ESSEM process comprises two phases, the offline and the online. In the offline phase, we prepare an ensemble speaker and speaking environment space formed by a collection of super-vectors. Each super-vector consists of the entire set of means from all the Gaussian mixture components of a set of hidden Markov models that characterizes a particular environment. In the online phase, with the ensemble environment space prepared in the offline phase, we estimate the super-vector for a new testing environment based on a stochastic matching criterion. In this paper, we focus on methods for enhancing the construction and coverage of the environment space in the offline phase. We first demonstrate environment clustering and partitioning algorithms to structure the environment space well; then, we propose a minimum classification error training algorithm to enhance discrimination across environment super-vectors and therefore broaden the coverage of the ensemble environment space. We evaluate the proposed ESSEM framework on the Aurora2 connected digit recognition task. Experimental results verify that ESSEM provides clear improvement over a baseline system without environmental compensation. Moreover, the performance of ESSEM can be further enhanced by using well-structured environment spaces. Finally, we confirm that ESSEM gives the best overall performance with an environment space refined by an integration of all techniques.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5067414/05067420.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ensemble Speaker and Speaking Environment Modeling Approach to Robust Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2016231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2016231","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Ensemble Speaker and Speaking Environment Modeling Approach to Robust Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10713578","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5067420/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ensemble Speaker and Speaking Environment Modeling Approach to Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"17tasl05-ytsao-2016231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111716S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5067414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5067414","articleId":"5067420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5067485,"authors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Piotrowski","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Piotrowski","id":"37297117100"},{"name":"Peter Langendoerfer","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Langendoerfer","id":"37297116000"},{"name":"Steffen Peter","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Peter","id":"37297111100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4584-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4586-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5067485","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory","Wireless sensor networks","Middleware","Availability","Redundancy","Design optimization","Spatial databases","Costs","Intelligent networks","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","middleware","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly reliable cooperative data storage","wireless sensor networks","distributed resources","smart cooperation","middleware","reliable data storage","data availability","reasonable data redundancy","data exchange","data replication","event mechanism","data management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative Computing","Wireless Sensor Networks","Software Development","Distributed Shared Memory","Distributed Data Storage"]}],"abstract":"The advantage of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) compared to a centric approach is the distribution of sensing suites. However, in order for such a system of distributed resources to work in a reliable and effective way a smart cooperation between nodes is needed. In this paper we propose a middleware approach for a highly reliable data storage that helps to assure data availability despite the well known WSN resource problems and disappearing or inactive nodes by providing a reasonable data redundancy in the system. Such a solution helps to ease the design and optimization of the data exchange between nodes as well. Our solution is configurable in order to satisfy the needs of the application on top regarding performance/requirements trade-off. The options specify the quantity and quality of the data replication. Additional features like event mechanism that monitors the data and the possibility to issue database like queries increase the applicability of our middleware. In this paper we focus on the evaluation of its capabilities regarding reliability, the consistency of replicates and the costs of the data management. The simulation results for a reasonable set-up show that the CPU load caused by the data replication is low (below 3 percent) and the average inconsistency time is as small as about 0,06 seconds for a single hop and about 0,15 seconds for a two hops replication area. There is still room for improvements, but a clear definition of problems helps to find ways to cope with them in order to achieve the chosen goals.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2009.5067485","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5039044/5067423/05067485.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2009.5067485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"tinyDSM: A highly reliable cooperative data storage for Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067485/","displayDocTitle":"tinyDSM: A highly reliable cooperative data storage for Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702625","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067485/","conferenceDate":"18-22 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"tinyDSM: A highly reliable cooperative data storage for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059669S","chronDate":"18-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5039044","isNumber":"5067423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5039044","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5067423","articleId":"5067485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5067515,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey C.

The proposed structure could be used for the design of the new type of waveguides named gap waveguides.","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067569.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cut-off bandwidth of metamaterial-based parallel plate gap waveguide with one textured metal pin surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067569/","displayDocTitle":"Cut-off bandwidth of metamaterial-based parallel plate gap waveguide with one textured metal pin surface","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698280","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067569/","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cut-off bandwidth of metamaterial-based parallel plate gap waveguide with one textured metal pin surface","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0006_1569154161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129301S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5067577,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The code provides low and high frequency analysis of arbitrary metallic or dielectric 3D structures and it is very useful to design antennas, to analyze antennas on board platforms, electromagnetic compatibility, periodical structures, radomes, etc. The structure under analysis is defined internally by means of non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) that can be generated by the most used computer aided geometrical design (CAGD) tools . The program includes a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) where the user can visualize the geometrical model from any point of view, build geometries, set the simulation options, display the results, etc. MONURBS can works on several operating systems and platforms including highly parallelized versions for multiprocessor computers or clusters. Also, the implementation of the optimizer allows robust and efficient electromagnetic optimization for a large number of optimization variables and goals. MONURBS has been validated in many applications and gives accurate predictions compared with measurements. The main features of MONURBS are compared to the characteristics of the most popular electromagnetic commercial solvers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MONURBS, a parallelized moment method code that combines FMLMP, CBF and MPI","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067595.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"MONURBS, a parallelized moment method code that combines FMLMP, CBF and MPI","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067595/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698305","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MONURBS, a parallelized moment method code that combines FMLMP, CBF and MPI","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0032_1569153807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047434S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5067603,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos A.

In this paper the effects of electromagnetic human interaction is studied for a laptop MIMO array, where four integrated antenna elements can operate simultaneously. Two points of view are considered: array performance and EM dosimetry. The first one addresses not only the degradation of antenna array performance but includes also the effect of the human proximity on the array characteristics, namely scattering matrix, total active reflection coefficient (TARC), radiation efficiency and envelope correlation between port signals. The exposure of the human tissues to EM radiation is expressed in terms of specific absorption rate (SAR). All those characteristics are evaluated as a function of the array excitation scheme (including phased array approach and MIMO-like signalling) and compared to simple scenarios where all the power is radiated only by one antenna element.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and

We first investigate the validity of the wide-sense stationarity (WSS) assumption by using the correlation matrix distance (CMD), which is an earlier introduced metric for characterizing the MIMO channel non-stationarity. Finally, we develop a statistical 20 MHz bandwidth channel model in the highway environment, including tap amplitude statistics and inter-tap correlation matrices.

The MIMO V2V channel model, called for brevity T-model, captures the propagation effects that occur if vehicles move towards a junction with a side road and corner buildings. The starting point for the derivation of the T-model is a new geometric T-junction scattering model, where both single- and double-bounce scattering mechanisms are assumed. Our geometry-based channel model takes into account the exact relationship between the angle-of-arrival (AOA) and the angle-of-departure (AOD). The statistical properties of the T-model are studied under the assumption of non-isotropic scattering. An analytical solution is provided for the space-time-frequency cross-correlation function (STF-CCF) from which several other important characteristic quantities like the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) can directly be obtained. The achieved theoretical results are illustrated for a typical T-junction propagation scenario. This research work provides designers of MIMO V2V communication systems an important tool in form of a wideband spatial channel model enabling the performance analysis of new high data rate transmission schemes under propagation conditions occurring at T-junctions.","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067706.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","startPage":"652","endPage":"656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels in T-junction scattering environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels in T-junction scattering environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067706/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698412","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5067706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels in T-junction scattering environments","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0143_1569165365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071786S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5067733,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Aperiodic arrays with elements using only amplifiers working at the same, optimised, point represent an interesting solution especially when the array has to generate a pencil beam with a limited scanning range. In this paper a deterministic procedure for designing a non-periodic planar array radiating a rotationally symmetric pencil beam pattern with an adjustable sidelobe level is proposed. The procedure relies on modifying the typical locations of the sunflower seeds that are deployed on a particular Fermat spiral.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067734.pdf","startPage":"778","endPage":"782","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067734","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Phased arrays","Apertures","Space technology","Satellites","Radar antennas","Costs","Directional antennas","Gratings","Linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","spiral antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial density tapered antenna array","sunflower antenna array","direct radiating arrays","beamforming network","aperiodic arrays","rotationally symmetric pencil beam pattern","adjustable sidelobe level","Fermat spiral"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067734/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial density tapered sunflower antenna array","accessionNumber":"10698439","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5067734/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial density tapered sunflower antenna array","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0171_1569154551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054408S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5067741,"authors":[{"name":"Elham Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Electronic, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37300115700"},{"name":"Peter S.

The structure is a novel combination of wideband and narrowband antennas into the same volume. The wideband antenna is a CPW fed printed hour-glass shaped monopole which operates from 3 to 11 GHz.

This design can be suitable for cognitive radio applications where a wideband antenna is required for spectrum sensing and a narrowband antenna for operation which can be tuned over a wide bandwidth using an external tuning circuit. The UWB and WLAN bands were chosen to demonstrate the integration principle, although cognitive radio may initially cover lower frequencies than these.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067741.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"809","endPage":"812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual port wide-narrowband antenna for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A dual port wide-narrowband antenna for cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067741/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698446","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual port wide-narrowband antenna for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0178_1569153681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05223S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5067748,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Toso","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Toso","id":"37314183100"},{"name":"Piero Angeletti","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Angeletti","id":"37314190800"},{"name":"Cyril Mangenot","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Mangenot","id":"37284628100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5067748","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Satellite broadcasting","Satellite antennas","High power amplifiers","Radio frequency","Earth","Costs","Phased arrays","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active antenna arrays","multibeam antennas","satellite antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active transmit antenna array","density tapering","amplitude tapering","active aperiodic array","active aperiodic arrays","on-board Earth orbiting satellite","equiamplitude excitation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067748","abstract":"Antenna architectures based on active aperiodic arrays are considered a promising solution for multibeam transmit antenna embarked on board Earth orbiting satellites.

The amount of leakage from one polarization to another is usually represented by the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD), making it a fundamental parameter of cross-polarized antenna systems. Starting from the definition of Rayleigh and Rice fading channels, we show that the small-scale variations of the XPD follow an F-distribution and a doubly non-central F-distribution respectively in Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels. This distribution is compared with the log-normal distribution that is usually reported in literature for the variations of the XPD. Consequences of this distribution are investigated, and it is shown that the variations of the XPD and the Ricean K-factors are linked by a non-trivial relationship. Measurements have been carried out in an indoor environment at 3.6 GHz to validate the theoretical F-model. The theoretical model and the experimental data are compared visually, by means of the mean square error and by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The theoretical F-model shows excellent agreement with the measured XPD variations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067787.pdf","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1015","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-scale variations of cross-polar discrimination in polarized MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Transmitters","Electromagnetic wave polarization","Log-normal distribution","Indoor environments","Rayleigh channels","Rayleigh scattering","Random variables","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microwave measurement","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarized MIMO systems","low inter-antenna correlation","cross-polarization discrimination","cross-polarized antenna systems","Rice fading channels","Rayleigh fading channels","log-normal distribution","Ricean K-factors","mean square error","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test","multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems","frequency 3.6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","polarization","XPD","channel modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Small-scale variations of cross-polar discrimination in polarized MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067787/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698492","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-scale variations of cross-polar discrimination in polarized MIMO systems","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0224_1569150137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054746S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5067790,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The antenna consists of a circular patch whose radius can be reconfigured to change the shape of the excited radiation pattern. Perturbation segments are connected or disconnected from the inner circular patch through PIN diodes to dynamically change the antenna polarization state. To diminish the antenna space occupation on the communication device two feed points are located on the same antenna structure such as a single antenna acts as a two element array. The gains offered by the antenna have been determined through field measurements in an indoor environment, using channel capacity as performance metric. Employing the proposed antenna in a 2times2 802.11n MIMO system, we measured on average a percentage capacity improvement of 26% with respect to non reconfigurable circular patches that works with the electromagnetic mode TM\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n.","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067795.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern and polarization reconfigurable circular patch for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067795/","displayDocTitle":"Pattern and polarization reconfigurable circular patch for MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698500","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067795/","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern and polarization reconfigurable circular patch for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0232_1569152695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041833S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5067797,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Shoaib","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK","Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Imran","lastName":"Shoaib","id":"37319039200"},{"name":"Yue Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Gao","id":"37309917200"},{"name":"Katsunori Ishimiya","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Research Center, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Katsunori","lastName":"Ishimiya","id":"37319040700"},{"name":"Xiaodong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278211900"},{"name":"Zhinong Ying","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Research Center, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhinong","lastName":"Ying","id":"37305489700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5067797","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Indoor environments","Channel capacity","Ray tracing","Antennas and propagation","Floors","Dielectric resonator antennas","Linear antenna arrays","Bandwidth","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","dielectric resonator antennas","indoor radio","MIMO communication","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["802.11n compact MIMO DRA","indoor MIMO channel capacity","ray tracing technique","dielectric resonator antenna"]}],"abstract":"This paper features some of the recent advances in study of the 802.11n Compact MIMO DRA, developed at the Sony Ericsson Research Center and Queen Mary, University of London.

The CQHA is combination of two QHAs with opposite winding rotation where one is positioned inside of the other. Low return loss and isolation of the CQHA elements is achieved by varying the radius of the outer QHA while the inner QHA is fixed. Preliminary evaluation of its MIMO capability is done by calculating the mean effective gain and analysing the polarisation correlation of each QHA. A deployment configuration of two CQHAs for land mobile satellite /DVB-SH vehicular rooftop antenna is also proposed in this paper. Mean effective gain of the CQHA configuration for a complete azimuth plane is calculated by considering Gaussian angle of arrival model for the angular distribution of the incident waves.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067801.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1076","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual circularly polarised Contrawound Quadrifilar Helix Antenna for land mobile satellite MIMO terminal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Helical antennas","Mobile antennas","Satellite antennas","MIMO","Least squares approximation","Frequency","Mutual coupling","Antennas and propagation","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","direction-of-arrival estimation","electromagnetic wave polarisation","Gaussian processes","land mobile radio","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual circularly polarised contrawound quadrifilar helix antenna","land mobile satellite MIMO terminal","DVB-SH vehicular rooftop antenna","Gaussian angle of arrival model","digital video broadcasting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A dual circularly polarised Contrawound Quadrifilar Helix Antenna for land mobile satellite MIMO terminal","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698506","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual circularly polarised Contrawound Quadrifilar Helix Antenna for land mobile satellite MIMO terminal","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0238_1569153771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045041S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5067803,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Sahaya Kulandai Raj","affiliation":["Institute of High Frequency Technology, Braunschweig University of Technology, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Joseph Sahaya Kulandai","lastName":"Raj","id":"37270761300"},{"name":"Joerg Schoebel","affiliation":["Institute of High Frequency Technology, Braunschweig University of Technology, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Schoebel","id":"37298981900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5067803","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"abstract":"In this paper, we derive the distance criterion and minimum capacity expressions of a dual polarized 4times4 Line Of Sight (LOS) MIMO channel with linear arrays.

However, to date, little work has appeared on methods to use the increased randomness available when the network nodes have multiple antennas.

Three scenarios were considered; coverage, outdoor-to-indoor, and LOS MIMO rank enhancement. The overall results showed good improvement in received signal strength, ranging from only a few dB up to 25 dB depending on the particular measurement scenario. Moreover, the concept of repeater-aided rank enhancement in LOS also showed good results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and evaluation of a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO repeater","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067900.pdf","startPage":"1509","endPage":"1512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO repeater","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067900/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698605","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO repeater","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0337_1569164559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038955S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5067902,"authors":[{"name":"Fabien Ferrero","affiliation":["LEAT-CNRS, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, La Valbonne, France"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Ferrero","id":"37304587400"},{"name":"Aliou Diallo","affiliation":["LEAT-CNRS, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, La Valbonne, France"],"firstName":"Aliou","lastName":"Diallo","id":"37286270700"},{"name":"Cyril Luxey","affiliation":["LEAT-CNRS, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, La Valbonne, France"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Luxey","id":"37284039900"},{"name":"Benoit Derat","affiliation":["Research and Development Department, SAGEM Mobiles, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Derat","id":"37318582000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5067902","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","3G mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Azimuthal plane","Prototypes","Diversity methods","Antennas and propagation","Signal design","Mobile antennas","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","mobile antennas","planar inverted-F antennas","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-antenna UMTS mobile phone structure","pattern diversity","polarization diversity","electric field","azimuthal plane","PIFA","port-to-port isolation","antenna feed","propagation environment"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we describe the design of a novel two-antenna UMTS mobile phone structure able to either radiate vertically or horizontally polarized electric fields in the azimuthal plane of the phone depending the relative phase of the input signals of each antenna.

Presently the required antenna installations are tested by road driving, a time and money consuming adventure. This paper proposes a virtual drive, by which not only the test but also an optimization of the car-integrated antenna systems can be performed. This is achieved by electromagnetically modeling the complete scene, i.e. driving the electromagnetically modeled antennas on the car through a coverage predicted by ray-tracing. The obtained results are the complex output voltages at the different antennas, which allow for evaluating the antenna system suitability for communications applications with diversity and MIMO techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05067996.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1939","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5067996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-tracing in a Virtual Drive for mobile communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Mobile communication","Predictive models","Electromagnetic modeling","Vehicles","Roads","System testing","Performance evaluation","Layout","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna testing","diversity reception","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile radio","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","virtual drive","mobile communication","antenna installation testing","car-integrated antenna systems","electromagnetically modeling","coverage prediction","diversity communications","MIMO techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5067996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Ray-tracing in a Virtual Drive for mobile communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5067996/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698699","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-tracing in a Virtual Drive for mobile communications","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0433_1569152233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061099S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5067996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5068015,"authors":[{"name":"Piero Angeletti","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Angeletti","id":"37314190800"},{"name":"Giovanni Toso","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Toso","id":"37314183100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5068015","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068015","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Antenna radiation patterns","Design methodology","Linear antenna arrays","Gratings","Antenna arrays","Satellite antennas","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","linear antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear planar aperiodic antenna array synthesis","space application","amplitude/density synthesis approach","deterministic technique","satellite communication","antenna radiation pattern"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a deterministic technique for the synthesis of linear aperiodic arrays with an assigned number of elements and amplitude excitation is introduced.

However, multipath waves, whose delay times are longer than the guard interval, cause intersymbol interference, because of which the performance of the system degrades. The effectiveness of adaptive arrays in overcoming this problem has been investigated. This paper proposes the use of an adaptive array with orthogonal projection for OFDM transmission with zero carriers. In the proposed method, the projection matrix is calculated from the zero carriers including the interference wave, and the matrix is used to suppress the undersired waves. Then, maximal-ratio combining is performed in each subcarrier. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively suppresses undesired waves.","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05068018.pdf","startPage":"2041","endPage":"2045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive antenna using orthogonal projection for OFDM transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068018/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive antenna using orthogonal projection for OFDM transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698721","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5068018/","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive antenna using orthogonal projection for OFDM transmission","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0455_1569151915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058989S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5068018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5068019,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Piazza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Piazza","id":"37304110100"},{"name":"D'Amico Michele","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"D'Amico","lastName":"Michele","id":"37304109800"},{"name":"Kapil R.

The antenna design consists of a periodic structure composed of cascaded CRLH microstrip unit cells with tunable electrical characteristics. Two separate ports are located on the same antenna structure such that a single physical antenna can be used as a two element array for reduced antenna space occupation on the communication device. The two element array allows for steering two beams symmetrically with respect to the broadside direction over a wide angular range. Ideally an infinite number of radiation patterns can be excited at each port while keeping good impedance matching and high isolation between the two ports. The gain achievable through this antenna varies between 0.7 and 6.2 dBi depending on the array configuration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","startPage":"2046","endPage":"2049","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05068019.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two port reconfigurable CRLH leaky wave antenna with improved impedance matching and beam tuning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068019/","displayDocTitle":"Two port reconfigurable CRLH leaky wave antenna with improved impedance matching and beam tuning","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698722","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two port reconfigurable CRLH leaky wave antenna with improved impedance matching and beam tuning","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0456_1569152711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040875S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5068019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5068030,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Topa","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Topa","id":"37266336700"},{"name":"Artur Noga","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Noga","id":"37268107000"},{"name":"Andrzej Karwowski","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Karwowski","id":"37266338600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5068030","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectric losses","Moment methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic radiation","Material properties","Differential equations","Optical scattering","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD/MoM-PO hybrid method","antennas","combinative objects","dielectric bodies","moment method","physical optics"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the FDTD/MoM-PO hybrid technique is presented.

In this article, we focus on the theoretical estimation and comparison of FDTD and ray methods in aspects of the algorithmic complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05068067.pdf","startPage":"2262","endPage":"2265","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithmic complexity of FDTD and ray tracing method for indoor propagation modelling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Ray tracing","Optical reflection","Difference equations","Electromagnetic modeling","Geometrical optics","Maxwell equations","Magnetic fields","Magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","finite difference time-domain analysis","indoor radio","radiowave propagation","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor propagation modelling","algorithmic complexity","ray tracing method","mobile phone","radio coverage","wireless LAN","three dimensional FDTD method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Algorithmic complexity of FDTD and ray tracing method for indoor propagation modelling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5068067/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10698770","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithmic complexity of FDTD and ray tracing method for indoor propagation modelling","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0504_1569152795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046687S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5068067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5068069,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Stabler","affiliation":["AWE Communications GmbH, Boblingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Stabler","id":"37303173200"},{"name":"Reiner Hoppe","affiliation":["AWE Communications GmbH, Boblingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Reiner","lastName":"Hoppe","id":"37285625700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5068069","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":951},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068069","abstract":"Future wireless communication systems are expected to offer highly reliable broadband radio access in order to meet the increasing demands of emerging high speed data and multimedia services. In recent years information theoretic investigations have shown that multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can support extremely high data rates within rich scattering environments. To design high efficient MIMO wireless systems and predict system performance under various circumstances accurate MIMO wireless channel models for different scenarios are required. Recently, standardized double directional stochastic MIMO channel models have been proposed for different scenarios based on the statistical information evaluated from measured data. However, statistical channel models are based on measurement campaigns and therefore only valid for the measured scenarios. In this paper the MIMO channel capacity has been evaluated using deterministic channel modeling. A three dimensional ray tracing package has been utilized for the determination of the propagation paths and further crucial parameters of the radio channel, such as the angular spread at both base and mobile station.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Ray tracing","Wireless communication","Multimedia systems","Scattering","System performance","Predictive models","Stochastic processes","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","multimedia communication","ray tracing","solid modelling","statistical analysis","telecommunication computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel capacity","3D ray tracing model","wireless communication system","broadband radio access","multimedia service","multiple-input multiple-output system","wireless channel","statistical channel model","propagation path"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO channel","deterministic channel modeling","ray tracing","channel matrix","channel capacity","Doppler spread"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","startPage":"2271","endPage":"2275","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05068069.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO channel capacity computed with 3D ray tracing model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MIMO channel capacity computed with 3D ray tracing model","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10698772","publicationDate":"March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068069/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO channel capacity computed with 3D ray tracing model","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0506_1569152955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037307S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5068069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5068127,"authors":[{"name":"D.

However, in most of engineering problems such an optimization approach could be very computational expensive, since it could require the computation of a complex fitness function thousands of times. An example of this is for instance the design of a large array or reflectarray, in which the structure to be optimized presents a lot of degrees of freedom and all concur to the performances of the whole antenna. To enhance the speed of the optimization task, in this work the optimization of a broadband reflectarray antenna has been carried out introducing a Neural Network model of the single element of the reflectarray: the artificial neural network (ANN) is used to predict the phase behaviour of patch radiator as a function of its geometric parameters. The characterization of the antenna is first obtained by numerical simulations, and the ANN is constructed to approximate the nonlinear relationship between the antenna geometry and the phase behaviour. Some preliminary results will show the effectiveness of this method in providing a fast interface between the antenna model and the optimisation tool.","startPage":"2520","endPage":"2522","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05068127.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network characterization of microstrip patches for reflectarray optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068127/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network characterization of microstrip patches for reflectarray optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5068127/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10698828","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network characterization of microstrip patches for reflectarray optimization","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0564_1569165693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051027S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5068127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5068140,"authors":[{"name":"Somayyeh Chamaani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, K.N.

From a total number of M radiating elements a sub-set of N successive ones is active at each time. The selection of the N elements array is based on minimizing of the angle between the broadside direction and the direction of arrival of the signal of interest, (SOI). Furthermore the gain maximization is proposed by adaptively combining the outputs of the enabled sub-array elements. The above concept is implemented for the uplink of a wireless communications system and is used for a base station receiver. In the design a comprehensive justification is given and a performance evaluation under various simulation scenarios that include integration into a 2D-RAKE receiver and a MIMO system is made.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10698874","htmlLink":"/document/5068173/","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the performance aspects of a cylindrical beamforming array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance aspects of a cylindrical beamforming array","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0610_1569166359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042777S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5068173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5068192,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The scheme is based on orthogonal code-multiplexed pilots that are characterized as virtual users and their number is determined in an adaptive way, on a frame level, according to the propagation channel conditions. The unique underlying pattern of pilots is used for CE before the data despreading operation. In addition, an iterative architecture has been incorporated and operates either in interference cancellation mode, or in virtual user one achieving remarkable results with respect to the residual self-interference elimination produced by the superimposed signal and the deorthogonalization effects caused by the time-variant channel properties. Furthermore, a preamble part has been included in the system design as an option for an initial accurate channel estimation which consequently results in optimization of the resources not only with respect to the spreading codes used for pilots, but also to the number of iterations achieving overall high system robustness. The proposed architecture has been evaluated in realistic highly time-variant propagation channels (802.16e channel model of 3GPP.25.996/SCM definition) for various constellation formats and FEC modes with M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n=2 Tx and M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n=1,hellip,4 Rx antennas operating in spatial diversity mode.","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977244/5067558/05068330.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067558","startPage":"3414","endPage":"3418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive turbo code-multiplexed pilot channel estimation for MIMO MC-CDMA systems in highly time-variant propagation channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive turbo code-multiplexed pilot channel estimation for MIMO MC-CDMA systems in highly time-variant propagation channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068330/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10699027","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068330/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive turbo code-multiplexed pilot channel estimation for MIMO MC-CDMA systems in highly time-variant propagation channels","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"0767_1569161887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041612S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977244","isNumber":"5067558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977244","xplore-issue":"5067558","articleId":"5068330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5068331,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Rossetto","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Munich, Germany","University of Padova, DEI, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Rossetto","id":"37271354300"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["University of Padova, DEI, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37278668800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4753-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-00-024573-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5068331","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Network coding","Decoding","Fading","Channel state information","MIMO","Computer errors","Navigation","Information technology","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","encoding","MIMO communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO_NC sensitivity","channel estimation errors","channel state information","wireless network coding","system parameters"]}],"abstract":"MIMO_NC is a recently proposed physical layer for wireless network coding.

Small-signal measurements reveal that the XGM bandwidth as well as the conversion efficiency strongly depends on the bias current. Thus, it is possible to tune the XGM by increasing the current from a low efficiency with a 10-GHz bandwidth to a very efficient one with bandwidths well exceeding 40 GHz. Two different saturation mechanisms are responsible for this pronounced influence of the bias current: 1) total carrier depletion that leads to a slow broadband cross-gain saturation and 2) spectral hole burning that causes spectrally narrow-band high-speed XGM. With increasing current, the saturation by depleting the carrier reservoir, which feeds the QDs, is minimized, and therefore, spectral hole burning becomes more dominant. Large-signal wavelength conversion experiments using 50 ps pulses indicate that efficient high-speed XGM is feasible for pump and probe signal detuning up to 10 nm. With increasing detuning, larger pulse broadening and a decreasing efficiency are observed, consistent with the small-signal results. The results on the QD SOAs are compared to conventional quantum-well devices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2012395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5068462/05068469.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"756","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2012395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Small-Signal Cross-Gain Modulation in Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers at 1.3 -m","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-june  2009","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Small-Signal Cross-Gain Modulation in Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers at 1.3 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>m","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5068469/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-june 2009","accessionNumber":"10713906","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Small-Signal Cross-Gain Modulation in Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers at 1.3 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>m","sourcePdf":"jstqe-meuer-2012395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095986S","chronDate":"May-june  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5068462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5068462","articleId":"5068469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5068582,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuangde Jiang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK","State Key Laboratory of Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Zhuangde","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37292433500"},{"name":"Fengxia Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Fengxia","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290572200"},{"name":"Weixuan Jing","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China","State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Weixuan","lastName":"Jing","id":"37286124100"},{"name":"Philip D.

The humidity sensor consists of a substrate with a cavity, a bottom electrode, a sensing layer, and a comb-shaped top electrode with branches. The cavity structure of the substrate was formed to protect the sensing material and improve reliability. PI was employed for the sensing layer due to its low hysteresis, good linearity, high sensitivity and high resistance to most chemicals. The comb-shaped top electrode was designed to have 50% fill factor with branches and the coated PI was etched by using O\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n plasma asher in accordance with the top electrode passivation. This structure could improve the sensitivity and the response time of the humidity sensor due to larger area of contact between the PI and vapor, and shorter pathway of vapor absorption. The humidity sensor was fabricated on a 4 inch silicon wafer by MEMS technology. The humidity sensor with the etched PI showed a high sensitivity of 350 fF/%RH and the response time of 40 sec from room humidity condition to 90%RH.

A bus waveguide couples to a micro ring resonator and they are integrated on the supporting point of a cantilever. We can obtain the value of displacement sensor by means of monitoring the changes in the transmission spectrum of the ring resonator due to the photo-elastic effect and the change of circumference as the deformation of cantilever. This method has high sensitivity and can be used in harsh environments such as ultra-high vacuum (UHV) systems and electromagnetically active environments. Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations were carried out to obtain the optimum sensor design and Beam Propagation Method (BPM) simulation was used to obtain the transfer characteristics of the bus waveguide and the micro ring resonator. In this paper, operation principles and sensitivity analysis are discussed in detail. Different types of ring resonators are studied in order to achieve high sensitivity and the radius of 20 mum of ring resonator is chose eventually. Further more, because of the fabrication limit, the FIB (Focused Ion Beam) is used to etch the gap between waveguide and ring resonator accurately after RIE etching, which can control the gap to less than 100 nm, and the whole manufacturing process is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068742","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1003","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4982489/5068512/05068742.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated high sensitivity displacement sensor based on micro ring resonator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Integrated high sensitivity displacement sensor based on micro ring resonator","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5068742/","accessionNumber":"10717159","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068742/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated high sensitivity displacement sensor based on micro ring resonator","confLoc":"Shenzhen","sourcePdf":"0374_attachment.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055721S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4982489","isNumber":"5068512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4982489","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5068512","articleId":"5068742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5068838,"authors":[{"name":"Odile Bourquardez","affiliation":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA), Institut de Recherche en Informatique et Syst\u00e8mes Al\u00e9atoires, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Odile","lastName":"Bourquardez","id":"37696024500"},{"name":"Robert Mahony","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Mahony","id":"37283743600"},{"name":"Nicolas Guenard","affiliation":["Commissariat \u00e0 l'Energie Atomique, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Guenard","id":"37563098900"},{"name":"Fran\u00c7ois Chaumette","affiliation":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA), Institut de Recherche en Informatique et Syst\u00e8mes Al\u00e9atoires, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00c7ois","lastName":"Chaumette","id":"37265186700"},{"name":"Tarek Hamel","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique, Signaux et Systemes de Sophia antipolis (I3S), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universit\u00e9 de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Hamel","id":"37299810900"},{"name":"Laurent Eck","affiliation":["Commissariat \u00e0 l'Energie Atomique, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Eck","id":"37546389200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"5068838","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":138,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2535},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate a range of image-based visual servo control algorithms for regulation of the position of a quadrotor aerial vehicle.

Using this method the performance of both regular and irregular LDPC codes can be studied in a unified manner without using simulation.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2009.5068932","publicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977245/5068929/05068932.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2009.5068932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068929","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of threshold of regular and irregular LDPC codes using Gaussian approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of threshold of regular and irregular LDPC codes using Gaussian approximation","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068932/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690217","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068932/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of threshold of regular and irregular LDPC codes using Gaussian approximation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1569170240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044646S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977245","isNumber":"5068929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977245","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5068929","articleId":"5068932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5068934,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Terng Juang","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rong-Terng","lastName":"Juang","id":"37269584900"},{"name":"Pangan Ting","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pangan","lastName":"Ting","id":"38523301900"},{"name":"Kun-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37309189600"},{"name":"Hsin-Piao Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Piao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279364000"},{"name":"Ding-Bing Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding-Bing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37271474900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2589-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"5068934","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","OFDM","Spread spectrum communication","Time domain analysis","Automatic repeat request","Forward error correction","Redundancy","Fading","Communication industry","Computer industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet retransmission scheme","interference cancellation","MIMO-OFDM systems","spread spectrum technique","transmission domain","signal separation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a packet retransmission scheme with interference cancellation for OFDM systems based on the basic principle of spread spectrum technique.

Such simulation software packages include OPNET, ns-2 and others. These programs are capable of performing relatively accurate simulations of networking architectures including wireless, ad hoc, and sensor networks. Although they are very useful for a wide range of experiments which involve performance evaluation of existing protocols, selecting them to verify and test the performance of new platforms and protocols that are not implemented in these programs tend to impose considerable restrictions and limitations. Therefore, implementing these protocols in existing simulator packages could be relatively difficult and time consuming. This paper presents an object-oriented framework to design an event-driven network simulator that can be used to evaluate different wireless networking architectures and protocols. The design of the simulator allows for a considerable increase in flexibility for the researcher who is able to include particular aspects and implementations of the corresponding protocols. The different classes that constitute the simulator application along with the main methods, and relationships are presented. In addition, design strategies for simulating node mobility using the popular Waypoint model are also presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible object-oriented design of an event-driven wireless network simulator","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2009.5068942","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977245/5068929/05068942.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2009.5068942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068942","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Object oriented modeling","Discrete event simulation","Packaging","Wireless sensor networks","Testing","Wireless application protocol","Software packages","Computer architecture","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","discrete event simulation","object-oriented programming","protocols","software packages","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible object-oriented design","event-driven wireless sensor network simulator","software package","Waypoint model","network protocol","OPNET network simulator","ns-2 network simulator","ad hoc network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless ad hoc and sensor network","network simulation","simulator design","object-oriented design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A flexible object-oriented design of an event-driven wireless network simulator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5068942/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10690227","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible object-oriented design of an event-driven wireless network simulator","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1569178863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054641S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977245","isNumber":"5068929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977245","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5068929","articleId":"5068942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5068956,"authors":[{"name":"Mingkwan Somphruek","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Mingkwan","lastName":"Somphruek","id":"37304125700"},{"name":"Rolando Carrasco","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Rolando","lastName":"Carrasco","id":"37268994800"},{"name":"Stephane Le Goff","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Le Goff","id":"37283397400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2589-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"5068956","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Parity check codes","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Diversity methods","Fading","System performance","Power system relaying","Time division multiple access","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative relay channel","LDPC code","cooperative communication","diversity technique","virtual multiple-antenna transmission","low-density parity-check","cooperative amplify-and-forward network","fading channel","encoding complexity","BER"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative communication represents a new class of diversity techniques in which multiple nodes each with a single antenna cooperate to generate a virtual multiple-antenna transmission system and thus offer the benefits of spatial diversity.

Two new PN mitigation techniques are proposed, especially targeted for reducing the intercarrier interference (ICI) effects due to PN. The first proposed method is a fairly simple one, stemming from the idea of linearly interpolating between two consecutive common phase error (CPE) estimates to obtain a linearized estimate of the time- varying phase characteristics. The second technique, in turn, is an extension to the existing state-of-the-art ICI estimation methods. Here the idea is to use an additional interpolation stage to improve the phase estimation performance around the boundaries of two consecutive OFDM symbols. The paper also verifies the performance improvement of these new PN estimation techniques by comparing them to the existing state- of-the-art techniques using extensive computer simulations. To emphasize practicality, the simulations are carried out in 3GPP-LTE downlink -like system context, covering both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and extended ITU-R Vehicular A multipath channel types.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2009.5068965","publicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977245/5068929/05068965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2009.5068965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068929","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase noise modelling and mitigation techniques in ofdm communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase noise modelling and mitigation techniques in ofdm communications systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068965/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690249","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase noise modelling and mitigation techniques in ofdm communications systems","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1569183558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092327S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977245","isNumber":"5068929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977245","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5068929","articleId":"5068965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5068968,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Hoyhtya","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Hoyhtya","id":"37297201800"},{"name":"Tao Chen","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37308411700"},{"name":"Aarne Mammela","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Aarne","lastName":"Mammela","id":"38516848400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2589-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"5068968","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency interference","Radio spectrum management","Frequency","Cognitive radio","Power control","Multidimensional systems","Couplings","Switches","Transmitting antennas","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency-domain analysis","power control","telecommunication control","telecommunication network management","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference management","frequency domain","space domain","time domain","cognitive radios","power control","predictive frequency selection","spectrum sensing","channel switches","high-antenna PU transmitter"]}],"abstract":"In order to minimize interference with primary users (PU), cognitive radios should operate multidimensionally over time, frequency, and space. This paper addresses the problem with power control and predictive frequency selection. Both the methods are coupled with spectrum sensing. The proposed frequency selection method minimizes the amount of channel switches, which increases the capacity of the system and decreases the number of collisions with PUs. It is shown that the allowed transmission power of an SU scales linearly with increasing primary transmission power. The results illustrate the effect of the antenna height to the maximum power; a high-antenna PU transmitter allows more powerful SUs. Moreover, simulations indicate that the power control method reduces greatly the amount of interference imposed towards PUs.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2009.5068968","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977245/5068929/05068968.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2009.5068968","publicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference management in frequency, time, and space domains for cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference management in frequency, time, and space domains for cognitive radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068968/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5068968/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690252","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference management in frequency, time, and space domains for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1569183771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068659S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977245","isNumber":"5068929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977245","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5068929","articleId":"5068968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5068970,"authors":[{"name":"Elmahdi Driouch","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Elmahdi","lastName":"Driouch","id":"37304160800"},{"name":"Wessam Ajib","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Ajib","id":"37294527900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2589-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"5068970","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Multiaccess communication","Processor scheduling","Optimal scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Receiving antennas","Array signal processing","Computational complexity","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO","CDMA","wireless systems","efficient multiuser scheduling scheme","multiple antennas","zero forcing beamforming","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"In multiuser CDMA wireless systems where the base station is equipped with multiple antennas, the base station takes advantage from the spatial and code separability between the served users in order to enhance the performance of the system. However, this enhancement is constrained by the design of an appropriate scheduling scheme which is responsible of choosing the best users to serve. In this paper, we propose efficient scheduling algorithms for the downlink of multiantenna CDMA wireless systems using zero forcing beamforming. Our proposition maximizes the system sum rate and keeps the computational complexity low. We make use of a graph theoretical approach to represent the system as an undirected weighted graph. As a second step, we formulate the scheduling problem as the maximum weight k-colorable subgraph problem. We propose two heuristic solutions to find the users to serve in each time slot in an acceptable polynomial time. Finally we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes by mean of simulations and the results show the near-optimal performance of the proposed schedulers with very low computational complexity compared to the optimal exhaustive search over all the possible users combinaisons.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2009.5068970","publicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977245/5068929/05068970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2009.5068970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068929","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient multiuser scheduling scheme for MIMO-CDMA wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient multiuser scheduling scheme for MIMO-CDMA wireless systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068970/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690254","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068970/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient multiuser scheduling scheme for MIMO-CDMA wireless systems","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1569183839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049567S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977245","isNumber":"5068929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977245","xplore-issue":"5068929","articleId":"5068970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5068974,"authors":[{"name":"Volkan Kumbasar","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Gebze Institute of Technology (GYTE), Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Volkan","lastName":"Kumbasar","id":"37304195700"},{"name":"Oguz Kucur","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Gebze Institute of Technology (GYTE), Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Oguz","lastName":"Kucur","id":"37304195400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2589-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"5068974","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Transmitters","Low pass filters","Bandwidth","MIMO","Wireless communication","OFDM modulation","Filter bank","Discrete wavelet transforms","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","discrete Fourier transforms","fading channels","OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Alamouti coded wavelet","OFDM","multipath fading channels","DFT"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we examined the performance of conventional DFT based OFDM and wavelet based OFDM (WOFDM) with and without Alamouti coding over multipath Rayleigh fading channels with exponential power delay profile.

The idea, which allowed decreasing the computational complexity of the PWBF method, is based on the observation that in dependency on signal to noise ratio, many of the received bits in the codeword of LDPC code could be without error. The augmented algorithm makes tests based on syndromes and symbol involvement in parity checks, which are given by the factor graph corresponding to the chosen LDPC code in order to define so called guaranteed bits. These guaranteed bits do not participate in the decoding calculations further. Simulation results are presented, which show that there is not visible any significant performance deterioration by application of this method and that the approximate speed up of the decoding for the tested codes is about 25% on the selected hardware in comparison with the known PWBF.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2009.5068982","publicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977245/5068929/05068982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2009.5068982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068929","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Parallel Weighted Bit Flipping decoding algorithm for LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Parallel Weighted Bit Flipping decoding algorithm for LDPC codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068982/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690266","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068982/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Parallel Weighted Bit Flipping decoding algorithm for LDPC codes","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1569184019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040564S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977245","isNumber":"5068929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977245","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5068929","articleId":"5068982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5068983,"authors":[{"name":"Hyeran Mun","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeran","lastName":"Mun","id":"37312175200"},{"name":"Kyusuk Han","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyusuk","lastName":"Han","id":"37309204400"},{"name":"Kwangjo Kim","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwangjo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280259800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2589-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"5068983","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1087},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Protocols","Public key cryptography","Communication system security","Communication standards","Standards development","3G mobile communication","Bandwidth","Elliptic curves","Elliptic curve cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","protocols","public key cryptography","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman","symmetric key cryptosystem","perfect forward secrecy","mutual authentication","public key cryptosystem","3G-WLAN interworking","wireless LAN","bandwidth consumption","sequence number","3rd generation partnership project","system architecture evolution","long term evolution","mobile communication"]}],"abstract":"The 3rd Generation Partnership Project(3GPP) standard is developing System Architecture Evolution(SAE)/Long Term Evolution(LTE) architecture for the next generation mobile communication system. The SAE/LTE architecture provides secure service and 3G-WLAN interworking [9]. To provide secure 3G-WLAN interworking in the SAE/LTE architecture, Extensible Authentication Protocol-Authentication and Key Agreement(EAP-AKA) is used. However, EAP-AKA has several vulnerabilities such as disclosure of user identity, man-in-the-middle attack, Sequence Number(SQN) synchronization, and additional bandwidth consumption. Therefore, this paper analyzes threats and attacks in 3G-WLAN interworking and proposes a new authentication and key agreement protocol based on EAPAKA. The proposed protocol combines Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman(ECDH) with symmetric key cryptosystem to overcome these vulnerabilities. Moreover, our protocol provides Perfect Forward Secrecy(PFS) to guarantee stronger security, mutual authentication, and resistance to replay attack. Compared with previous protocols which use public key cryptosystem with certificates, our protocol can reduce computational overhead.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2009.5068983","publicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4977245/5068929/05068983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2009.5068983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068929","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3G-WLAN interworking: security analysis and new authentication and key agreement based on EAP-AKA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5068983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3G-WLAN interworking: security analysis and new authentication and key agreement based on EAP-AKA","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5068983/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690267","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5068983/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3G-WLAN interworking: security analysis and new authentication and key agreement based on EAP-AKA","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1569184029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052184S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4977245","isNumber":"5068929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4977245","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5068929","articleId":"5068983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5069075,"authors":[{"name":"Elisabetta di Nitto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Elisabetta","lastName":"di Nitto","id":"37313118700"},{"name":"Daniel J.

But this situation has changed in the past few years, as dramatic enhancements to the output power and WPE have been made for InP-based mid-IR QCLs. Room temperature continuous-wave (CW) output power as high as 2.8 W and WPE as high as 15% have now been demonstrated for individual devices. Along with the fundamental exploration of refining the design and improving the material quality, a consistent determination of important device performance parameters allows for strategically addressing each component that can be improved potentially. In this paper, we present quantitative experimental evidence backing up the strategies we have adopted to improve the WPE for QCLs with room temperature CW operation.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2008.2006764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5068462/05069088.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2008.2006764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068462","startPage":"941","endPage":"951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance InP-Based Mid-IR Quantum Cascade Lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance InP-Based Mid-IR Quantum Cascade Lasers","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-june  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-june 2009","accessionNumber":"10713905","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069088/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance InP-Based Mid-IR Quantum Cascade Lasers","sourcePdf":"jstqe-razeghi-2006764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067132S","chronDate":"May-june  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5068462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5068462","articleId":"5069088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5069138,"authors":[{"name":"Aldeida Aleti","affiliation":["Faculty of ICT, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Aldeida","lastName":"Aleti","id":"37321026700"},{"name":"Stefan Bjornander","affiliation":["Faculty of ICT, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Bjornander","id":"37321025600"},{"name":"Lars Grunske","affiliation":["Faculty of ICT, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Grunske","id":"37297169700"},{"name":"Indika Meedeniya","affiliation":["Faculty of ICT, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Indika","lastName":"Meedeniya","id":"37321029500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3721-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069138","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Embedded system","Design optimization","Software safety","Software systems","Software quality","Costs","Algorithm design and analysis","Automotive engineering","Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","formal specification","optimisation","software architecture","software tools","systems analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architecture optimization","AADL models","ArcheOpterix","embedded systems quality requirements","architecture design phase","extendable Eclipse-based tool","AADL specifications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ArcheOpterix","Architecture and Deployment Architecture Optimization","AADL","Multi-Objective and Pareto Optimization","Evolutionary Algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069138","abstract":"For embedded systems quality requirements are equally if not even more important than functional requirements.

Some of the reasons for this are an ever-increasing complexity of today's systems, strict design constraints and conflicting quality requirements. To simplify the task, this paper presents an extendable Eclipse-based tool, called ArcheOpterix, which provides a framework to implement evaluation techniques and optimization heuristics for AADL specifications. Currently, evolutionary strategies have been implemented to identify optimized deployment architectures with respect to multiple quality objectives and design constraints. Experiments with a set of initial deployment architectures provide evidence that the tool can successfully find architecture specifications with better quality.","doi":"10.1109/MOMPES.2009.5069138","publicationTitle":"2009 ICSE Workshop on Model-Based Methodologies for Pervasive and Embedded Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICSE Workshop on Model-Based Methodologies for Pervasive and Embedded Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061472/5069117/05069138.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOMPES.2009.5069138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ArcheOpterix: An extendable tool for architecture optimization of AADL models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"ArcheOpterix: An extendable tool for architecture optimization of AADL models","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069138/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10699239","conferenceDate":"16-16 May 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ArcheOpterix: An extendable tool for architecture optimization of AADL models","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121044S","chronDate":"16-16 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061472","isNumber":"5069117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061472","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5069117","articleId":"5069138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5069155,"authors":[{"name":"Jo Erskine Hannay","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering Simula Research LaboratoryDepartment of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Jo Erskine","lastName":"Hannay","id":"37562303600"},{"name":"Carolyn MacLeod","affiliation":["Center of Biomedical Computing Simula Research Laboratory Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Carolyn","lastName":"MacLeod","id":"37321105000"},{"name":"Janice Singer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Janice","lastName":"Singer","id":"37270424700"},{"name":"Hans Petter Langtangen","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering Simula Research LaboratoryDepartment of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Hans Petter","lastName":"Langtangen","id":"37321104100"},{"name":"Dietmar Pfahl","affiliation":["Software Engineering Group, National Research Council Canada, Canada"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Pfahl","id":"37267571200"},{"name":"Greg Wilson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37308836500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3737-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069155","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1228},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How do scientists develop and use scientific software?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069155","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software testing","Software engineering","Knowledge engineering","Resource management","Computer science education","Supercomputers","Peer to peer computing","Automatic testing","Software standards","Standards development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scientific information systems","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scientific software","supercomputers","software testing","software engineering","software development projects"]}],"abstract":"New knowledge in science and engineering relies increasingly on results produced by scientific software.

The recorded video of the sign language is divided into number of image frames. Using a simple segmentation technique, the frame image is segmented into three region namely, head region, left hand region and right hand region. After performing the image segmentation, the image frames are converted into binary image format. A simple feature extraction method is then applied and the variations of the features in the subsequent frame are modeled using discrete cosine transform (DCT). The features extracted are associated to the equivalent voice sound and a simple neural network model trained by error prob method is developed. An audio system is used to play the equivalent voice signal from the recognized sign language.

It is well known that most of vocal fold pathologies cause changes in the acoustic voice signal. Therefore, the voice signal can be a useful tool to diagnose them. Acoustic voice analysis can be used to characterize the pathological voices. This paper presents the detection of vocal fold pathology with the aid of the speech signal recorded from the patients. Time-domain features are proposed and extracted to detect the vocal fold pathology. The main advantages of this method are less computation time, possibility of real-time system development and it requires no transformation techniques (frequency transformation or time-frequency transformation). In order to test the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed time-domain features, a simple neural network model with systole activation function is proposed and trained by conventional back propagation (BP) algorithm. The classification accuracy of the proposed systole activated neural network is comparable with the results of neural network model with sigmoidal activation function. The simulation results show that the proposed systole activated neural network reduces the time taken for training the neural network.","doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069181","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069167","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5028855/5069167/05069181.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis of vocal fold pathology using time-domain features and systole activated neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069181/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis of vocal fold pathology using time-domain features and systole activated neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069181/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10702036","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis of vocal fold pathology using time-domain features and systole activated neural network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095648S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5028855","isNumber":"5069167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5028855","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5069167","articleId":"5069181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5069182,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The two cameras are used to capture the images of a mobile robot at various orientations. Four simple neural network models are developed to associate the inputs and output (orientation). First and second neural network models are used to estimate the orientation of a mobile robot using only the features derived from the first and second camera. The third neural network model is used for estimating the orientation of a mobile robot using features derived from both the first and second camera.

Hence, it is necessary to develop an exclusive speech to text translation system for understanding the English pronunciation as spoken by Malaysians. Speech translation is a process of both speech recognition and equivalent phonemic to word translation. Speech recognition is a process of identifying phonemes from the speech segment. In this paper, the initial step for speech recognition by identifying the phoneme features is proposed. In order to classify the phoneme features, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are computed in this paper. A simple feed forward neural network (FFNN) trained by back propagation procedure is proposed for identifying the phonemes features. The extracted MFCC coefficients are used as input to a neural network classifier for associating it to one of the 11 classes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069189/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10702044","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069189/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of vowel sounds using MFCC and feed forward Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of vowel sounds using MFCC and feed forward Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055017S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5028855","isNumber":"5069167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5028855","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5069167","articleId":"5069189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5069197,"authors":[{"name":"Ussanai Nithirochananont","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Ussanai","lastName":"Nithirochananont","id":"37321099500"},{"name":"Sorawat Chivapreecha","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sorawat","lastName":"Chivapreecha","id":"37299246700"},{"name":"Kobchai Dejhan","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kobchai","lastName":"Dejhan","id":"37285082400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4151-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4152-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069197","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":493},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069197","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay effects","Lagrangian functions","Interpolation","Arithmetic","Transfer functions","Timing","Echo cancellers","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay filters","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable fractional delay filter","FPGA","Taylor structure","multiplier","adder"]}],"abstract":"A variable fractional delay (VFD) filter is widely used in applications such as symbol timing recovery, arbitrary sampling rate conversion and echo cancellation.

Hypothyroidism is a condition caused by insufficient production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. The proposed technique is robust as it automatically extracts and analyzes features of infant cry signal. In pre-processing of the signals, separation of voice or unvoiced sections is implemented with automatic segmentation that integrates zero rate crossing and short time energy methods. For feature extraction, the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient analysis is used to extract main features from the infant cry signal. Then, similarities between the two types of signals and significant information are studied using the F-Ratio analysis. Results show that the F-Ratio analysis was able to discriminate between essential and non-essential features for classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069217/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10702070","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069217/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient analysis of infant cry with hypothyroidism","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient analysis of infant cry with hypothyroidism","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04337S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5028855","isNumber":"5069167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5028855","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5069167","articleId":"5069217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5069222,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Peng","affiliation":["Graduate school of IPS, Waseda University, Japan"],"lastName":"Xiao Peng","id":"37087765761"},{"name":"Satoshi Goto","affiliation":["Graduate school of IPS, Waseda University, Japan"],"lastName":"Satoshi Goto","id":"37087208096"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4151-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4152-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069222","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of sphere detection combined with the LDPC decoding","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the low density parity-check (LDPC) decoding algorithms and the detection methods of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

The proposed Evolutionary Programming-ANN (EPANN) model employs solar radiation and ambient temperature as its inputs while the sole output is the kilowatt-hour energy output produced from the grid connected PV system. The prediction performance was quantified using the average correlation coefficient and it was maximized by determining the optimum values for the number of nodes in the hidden layer, momentum rate and learning rate during an evolutionary training. Besides searching for the optimal number of nodes and optimal training parameters for each model, the highest correlation coefficient for the prediction required for the EPANN was investigated. It was found that the maximum average correlation coefficient obtained for the EPANN training is 0.9962. Besides that, the testing process produced sufficiently high correlation coefficient value of 0.9976.","doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069236","pdfPath":"/iel5/5028855/5069167/05069236.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing one-hidden layer neural network design using Evolutionary Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing one-hidden layer neural network design using Evolutionary Programming","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10702089","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069236/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing one-hidden layer neural network design using Evolutionary Programming","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058512S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5028855","isNumber":"5069167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5028855","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5069167","articleId":"5069236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5069246,"authors":[{"name":"Aznida Alias","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering Universiti Teknologi MARA, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Aznida","lastName":"Alias","id":"37089045935"},{"name":"Mohd.

In this paper, FSM-based BIST is designed to be able detecting all intra-word coupling fault (CF) in a synchronous SRAM under low-area constraint of test requirement.","doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069261","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5028855/5069167/05069261.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low area FSM-based memory BIST for synchronous SRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069261/","displayDocTitle":"Low area FSM-based memory BIST for synchronous SRAM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069261/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10702114","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low area FSM-based memory BIST for synchronous SRAM","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041285S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5028855","isNumber":"5069167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5028855","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5069167","articleId":"5069261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5069265,"authors":[{"name":"Puteri Nurparina Bahrun","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Puteri Nurparina","lastName":"Bahrun","id":"37320505600"},{"name":"Mohd Nasir Taib","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Nasir","lastName":"Taib","id":"37322448400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4151-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4152-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069265","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069265","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Stock markets","Testing","Mathematical model","Economic forecasting","Autocorrelation","Profitability","Predictive models","Signal processing","Investments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","investment","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Malaysia stock predictions","artificial neural network","investment industry","feedforward backpropagation neural network","trading strategies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069265","pdfPath":"/iel5/5028855/5069167/05069265.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","startPage":"428","endPage":"431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selected Malaysia stock predictions using artificial neural network","abstract":"Stock market prediction is one of the fascinating issues of stock market research.

Hence, the method of Logical Effort (LE) provides a simple method to overcome these design problems. We apply a novel Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (DPSO) to solve the LE problem for electronic circuits. The method uses the rescaling function commonly used to scale datasets in neural networks to convert continuous-valued PSO values into discrete values. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied on a three-stage NAND gate circuit, and has been shown to work well, with 100% accuracy in all test runs.","doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069266","pdfPath":"/iel5/5028855/5069167/05069266.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"438","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2009.5069266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logical Effort using a Novel Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Logical Effort using a Novel Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10702119","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069266/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logical Effort using a Novel Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086691S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5028855","isNumber":"5069167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5028855","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5069167","articleId":"5069266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5069306,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Among all the genes, many are irrelevant, insignificant or redundant to the discriminant problem under investigation. Hence the identification of informative genes, which have the greatest power for classification, is of fundamental and practical importance to the investigation of specific discriminant problems, such as cancer versus non-cancer or different tumor types. In this paper, we propose a two-stage selection algorithm by combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first stage, MRMR is used to filter noisy and redundant genes in high dimensional microarray data. In the second stage, GA and SVM work together for selecting the highly discriminating genes. The proposed method is tested on five open datasets: NCI, Lymphoma, Lung, Leukemia and Colon. In the experiments, we compare our proposed MRMR-GA algorithm with GA-SVM wrapper and MRMR filter. The experimental results show that the proposed method has excellent selection and classification performances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069306/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10701822","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069306/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New gene selection approach based on Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (MRMR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New gene selection approach based on Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (MRMR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569161702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068279S","chronDate":"10-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010318","isNumber":"5069284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010318","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5069284","articleId":"5069306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5069322,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, we explore Genetic Algorithms (GA) as an alternative approach to derive these models. GA is a powerful machine learning technique and optimization techniques to estimate the parameters of well known reliably growth models. Moreover, machine learning algorithms, proposed the solution overcome the uncertainties in the modeling by combining multiple models using multiple objective function to achieve the best generalization performance where. The objectives are conflicting and no design exists which can be considered best with respect to all objectives. In this paper, experiments were conducted to confirm these hypotheses. Then evaluating the predictive capability of the ensemble of models optimized using multi-objective GA has been calculated.

In Service oriented computing (SOC), a service may interact with several types of service clients. The central problem is, therefore, how to model the multidimensional aspect of service clients' needs and requirements. To tackle this problem, we propose in this paper the concept of the multiview service as a first class modeling entity that permits the representation of the needs and requirements of end-users by separating their concerns. Such adaptable services must carefully be analyzed and designed. However, current works on service oriented analysis and design (SOAD) largely focus on defining processes to develop business processes and services without considering user-aware variability. In the present paper we present an MDA framework for a muliview SOAD process for the development of highly adaptable services. We specify transformations as a collection of rules implemented in ATL. The proposal is illustrated by a simple example.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web and internet services","Documentation","Resource management","Multidimensional systems","Proposals","Information systems","Context-aware services","Computer aided instruction","Web pages","Management training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","open systems","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven framework","multiview service oriented system development","complex systems development","service oriented computing","service oriented analysis and design","user-aware variability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069357","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010318/5069284/05069357.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model driven framework for multiview service oriented system development","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A model driven framework for multiview service oriented system development","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069357/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069357/","accessionNumber":"10701873","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model driven framework for multiview service oriented system development","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569162285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127777S","chronDate":"10-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010318","isNumber":"5069284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010318","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5069284","articleId":"5069357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5069362,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed El Aroussi","affiliation":["GSCM-LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"El Aroussi","id":"37320411800"},{"name":"Sanaa Ghouzali","affiliation":["GSCM-LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Sanaa","lastName":"Ghouzali","id":"37320412600"},{"name":"Mohammed El Hassouni","affiliation":["DESTEC, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"El Hassouni","id":"37320413000"},{"name":"Mohammed Rziza","affiliation":["GSCM-LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Rziza","id":"37320407000"},{"name":"Driss Aboutajdine","affiliation":["GSCM-LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Driss","lastName":"Aboutajdine","id":"37284909000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3807-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3806-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"}],"articleNumber":"5069362","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Face recognition","Spatial databases","Image databases","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Boosting","Testing","Pattern recognition","Character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curvelet transforms","face recognition","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","curvelet-based feature extraction","multiresolution curvelet transform","ensemble-based discriminant learning approach","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Curvelet","Contourlet","DWT","Boosting","face recognition (FR)","linear discriminant analysis","Principal Component Analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction scheme based on the multi-resolution curvelet transform for face recognition.

The reasoning engine designed is used to determine the type of channel that the WiMAX system is operating in. This paper investigates the applicability of using FL and CBR as the core reasoning engine for a cognitive radio WiMAX system. Evaluation is done based on the time taken for the system to determine the type of channel and the error in the decision of the reasoning engine.

The spread-use of reconfigurable hardware for stochastic simulation gathered a significant effort towards effective implementations of hardware pseudorandom numbers generators (PRNGs) - these generators needed to exhibit a statistically proven random behaviour and to be characterized by a very long period. In this paper we present the state of the art of hardware pseudorandom number generation in the context of Monte Carlo acceleration. We highlight the emerging trends over the most recent publications and suggest some insights on the forthcoming works. Furthermore, we provide a complete hardware description of a new Gaussian variate generator (GVG) and an exponential variate generator (EVG) based on a decision-tree technique of ours, herein presented as well.

While individual projects and groups of projects have been extensively analyzed, some fundamental questions, such as the spread of innovation or genealogy of the source code, can be answered only by considering the entire universe of publicly available source code and its history. We describe methods we developed over the last six years to gather, index, and update an approximation of such a universal repository for publicly accessible version control systems and for the source code inside a large corporation. While challenging, the task is achievable with limited resources. The bottlenecks in network bandwidth, processing, and disk access can be dealt with using inherent parallelism of the tasks and suitable tradeoffs between the amount of storage and computations, but a completely automated discovery of public version control systems may require enticing participation of the sampled projects. Such universal repository would allow studies of global properties and origins of the source code that are not possible through other means.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Control systems","History","Programming","Technological innovation","Bandwidth","Parallel processing","Storage automation","Computer networks","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configuration management","data mining","database indexing","public domain software","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public version control system indexing","public source code history","software development activity","universal software repository","network bandwidth","disk access","task parallelism","automated knowledge discovery","source code evolution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MSR.2009.5069476","publicationTitle":"2009 6th IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","pdfPath":"/iel5/5040630/5069458/05069476.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2009.5069476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amassing and indexing a large sample of version control systems: Towards the census of public source code history","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Amassing and indexing a large sample of version control systems: Towards the census of public source code history","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069476/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069476/","accessionNumber":"10690180","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amassing and indexing a large sample of version control systems: Towards the census of public source code history","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052025S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5040630","isNumber":"5069458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5040630","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5069458","articleId":"5069476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5069482,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Enslen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Enslen","id":"38291468900"},{"name":"Emily Hill","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Hill","id":"37314637800"},{"name":"Lori Pollock","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Lori","lastName":"Pollock","id":"37264940900"},{"name":"K.

The first step in analyzing words from identifiers requires splitting identifiers into their constituent words. Unlike natural languages, where space and punctuation are used to delineate words, identifiers cannot contain spaces. One common way to split identifiers is to follow programming language naming conventions. For example, Java programmers often use camel case, where words are delineated by uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters. However, programmers also create identifiers by concatenating sequences of words together with no discernible delineation, which poses challenges to automatic identifier splitting. In this paper, we present an algorithm to automatically split identifiers into sequences of words by mining word frequencies in source code. With these word frequencies, our identifier splitter uses a scoring technique to automatically select the most appropriate partitioning for an identifier. In an evaluation of over 8000 identifiers from open source Java programs, our Samurai approach outperforms the existing state of the art techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining source code to automatically split identifiers for software analysis","publicationTitle":"2009 6th IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","doi":"10.1109/MSR.2009.5069482","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","pdfPath":"/iel5/5040630/5069458/05069482.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2009.5069482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mining source code to automatically split identifiers for software analysis","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069482/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690186","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining source code to automatically split identifiers for software analysis","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112287S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5040630","isNumber":"5069458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5040630","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5069458","articleId":"5069482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5069510,"authors":[{"name":"Xianfu Lei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Coding & Transmission Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xianfu Lei","id":"37087209855"},{"name":"Norman C.

Unlike existing protocols, this protocol exploits multiuser nature of the bidirectional cooperative networks and it opportunistically supports two traffic flows based on instantaneous channel conditions. This makes the OSS protocol much more reliable than existing protocols. We derive a lower bound of the outage probability of the OSS protocol. This lower bound is extremely tight and it also indicates that the OSS protocol achieves full diversity order two in a bidirectional cooperative network with two sources and one relay. Then an optimum power allocation scheme is developed for the OSS protocol. This scheme can optimize the outage probability and mutual information of the OSS protocol at the same time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069512","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010319/5069503/05069512.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An opportunistic-based protocol for bidirectional cooperative networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"An opportunistic-based protocol for bidirectional cooperative networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701983","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An opportunistic-based protocol for bidirectional cooperative networks","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569185149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051743S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010319","isNumber":"5069503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010319","xplore-issue":"5069503","articleId":"5069512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5069515,"authors":[{"name":"Anxiao Jiang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Anxiao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37065614800"},{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hao Li","id":"37311295500"},{"name":"Yue Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yue Wang","id":"37311538100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3400-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3401-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069515","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Error correction codes","Modular construction","Error correction","Computer errors","Computer science","Nonvolatile memory","Flash memory cells","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error scrubbing codes","flash memories","nonvolatile electronic memories","block erasure operations","data integrity","error-correcting code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069515","abstract":"Flash memories are the most widely used type of non-volatile electronic memories. Every flash memory cell has q discrete levels for storing information. A prominent property of flash memories is that although it is easy to increase a cell level, to decrease any cell level, a whole block of cells have to be erased and reprogrammed. To minimize the number of expensive block erasure operations and to maintain the data integrity, the data needs to be stored with a strong error-correcting code that can correct enough errors between two erasure operations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of error scrubbing codes. With this new type of error-correcting codes, the cell levels are actively increased when errors appear, even if the errors increase cell levels as well. We show that error-scrubbing codes can outperform conventional error-correcting codes for multi-level flash memories.

We answer this question in two steps. First, we show that the asymptotic capacity of a broad class of MIMO channels (not necessarily Rayleigh-fading) with an arbitrary correlation structure does not depend on particular channel distribution, but only on the correlation between antennas. Second, the best multipath angular density, which eliminates the correlation and thus maximizes the asymptotic capacity of uniform linear antenna arrays, is shown to be non-uniform, which implies that the popular Clarke's model does not represent the best-case scenario. We identify the best angular density for different values of the antenna spacing. The Gaussian angular density (adopted in IEEE 802.11n) is shown to be near optimum when the spacing equals to the wavelength. Based on these results, practical guidelines for the antenna array design are given.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010319/5069503/05069519.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What is the best angular density of multipath in MIMO channels?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antennas and propagation","Channel capacity","Antenna arrays","Rayleigh channels","Linear antenna arrays","Fading","Directive antennas","Information technology","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","fading channels","Gaussian channels","linear antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO fading channel modeling","multipath angular density","channel capacity","asymptotic capacity","uniform linear antenna array","Gaussian angular density"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"What is the best angular density of multipath in MIMO channels?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701990","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What is the best angular density of multipath in MIMO channels?","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569185421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098731S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010319","isNumber":"5069503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010319","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5069503","articleId":"5069519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5069520,"authors":[{"name":"Charalambos D.

In the absence of channel reciprocity between the uplink and downlink, a feedback mechanism must be designed to communicate CSI estimates from the mobile receivers to the transmitter. Limiting the total feedback rate is an important design goal for multiuser multiple-input, multiple-output systems, as the feedback overhead can potentially consume a large percentage of system resources, especially when the total number of antennas is large. In this paper, we focus on the challenges of feedback delay and reducing feedback rate; we predict N-frames-ahead, based on the one-step Kalman predictor, and derive a theoretical expression for the prediction mean squared error (MSE). We present simulation results that illustrate a tradeoff between prediction MSE and computational complexity, and also demonstrate situations where adaptive delta modulation (ADM) can be used to exploit temporal redundancy and reduce the required feedback rate.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069503","startPage":"67","endPage":"70","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010319/5069503/05069523.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel prediction and feedback in multiuser broadcast channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069523/","displayDocTitle":"Channel prediction and feedback in multiuser broadcast channels","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701994","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel prediction and feedback in multiuser broadcast channels","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569189749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053826S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010319","isNumber":"5069503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010319","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5069503","articleId":"5069523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5069526,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Yu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37311123100"},{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"En-hui Yang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"En-hui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37272530400"},{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37278726600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3400-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3401-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069526","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","MIMO","Upper bound","Design optimization","Fading","H infinity control","Error probability","Source coding","Optimized production technology","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","fading channels","MIMO communication","space-time codes","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion SNR exponent","vector quantization","MIMO channels","source-channel coding system","space-time block coding","multiple-input multiple-output fading channels","quantization codebook","partition designs"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the distortion SNR exponent of a tandem source-channel coding system with vector quantization and space-time block coding on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels.

Symbol-error rates are simulated for a photon counting channel and performance improvements of about 2.9 dBo can be obtained over a single-detector receiver.","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069540","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010319/5069503/05069540.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical communication through time-varying turbulent atmosphere using compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069540/","displayDocTitle":"Optical communication through time-varying turbulent atmosphere using compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069540/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical communication through time-varying turbulent atmosphere using compressive sensing","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569189583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101883S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010319","isNumber":"5069503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010319","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5069503","articleId":"5069540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5069541,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Shi","id":"37307457000"},{"name":"Y.

For all scenarios considered, the total (aggregate) interference power is shown to be dominated by that of the nearest interferer (at the low outage region), which is used as a major performance indicator, instead of a traditionally-used aggregate interference power. This simplifies the problem significantly so that explicit closed-form analysis of the outage probability becomes feasible and the effect of various system/network parameters becomes also explicit, including the impacts of complete/partial interference cancellation, of different types of fading and of linear filtering, either alone or in combination with each other. When a given number of strongest interferers are completely canceled, the outage probability scales down exponentially in this number. Three different models of partial cancelation are considered and compared via their outage probabilities, which are obtained in compact closed form. The partial cancelation level required to eliminate the impact of an interferer is quantified. The effect of a broad class of fading processes (including all popular fading models) is included in the analysis in a straightforward way, which can be positive or negative depending on a particular model and propagation/system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069552","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069503","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010319/5069503/05069552.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Interference cancellation","Wireless networks","Aggregates","Electronic mail","Propagation losses","Power system modeling","Electromagnetic compatibility and interference","Electromagnetic compatibility","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation","wireless networks","outage probability tradeoff","closed-form analysis","complete/partial interference cancellation","linear filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The impact of fading and interference cancelation on node density - Outage probability tradeoff in wireless networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069552/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069552/","accessionNumber":"10702023","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of fading and interference cancelation on node density - Outage probability tradeoff in wireless networks","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569185331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083803S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010319","isNumber":"5069503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010319","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5069503","articleId":"5069552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5069556,"authors":[{"name":"Sayed Jalal Zahabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Sayed Jalal","lastName":"Zahabi","id":"37320468300"},{"name":"Ali.

This paper is trying to make a contribution in the challenge of spectrum sensing for cognitive radios. We consider a case in which the local sensors involved in the spectrum sensing are aware of the primary signal's digital modulation. As a case of study the primary user's signal is assumed to have a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, we therefore concentrate only on the presence detection of a BPSK signal. This work presents an innovative solution for presence detection of BPSK signals, in additive white Gaussian noise. We state the problem as a binary hypothesis test considering the noise variance, complex signal amplitude, and the symbol code sequence unknown. A new and simple search method for solving the maximization problem involved in deriving the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test is proposed. We evaluate the performance of the detector based on our simple search scheme and compare it with that of the exact GLR obtained via complete search and also with the previous works. The simulation results show that our proposed detector performs just as good as the exact GLR detector, with much less computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069556","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010319/5069503/05069556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069503","startPage":"209","endPage":"212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast spectrum search and detection for BPSK signals in a cognitive network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast spectrum search and detection for BPSK signals in a cognitive network","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069556/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702027","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069556/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast spectrum search and detection for BPSK signals in a cognitive network","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569190081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034403S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010319","isNumber":"5069503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010319","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5069503","articleId":"5069556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5069557,"authors":[{"name":"An-Zhong Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"An-Zhong","lastName":"Wong","id":"37305323800"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Kang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281463700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3400-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3401-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5069557","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Maximum likelihood detection","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Nearest neighbor searches","MIMO","Communication channels","Pairwise error probability","Detectors","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","MIMO communication","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes","MIMO communication channel","pair-wise error probability","maximum likelihood detector","diversity gains","multiplexing gains","multiple transmitter antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069557","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2009.5069557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069503","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010319/5069503/05069557.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel rotation angle for quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes","abstract":"Recently, various space-time block coding (STBC) schemes have been developed to take advantage of the MIMO communication channel. The code designs using the pair-wise error probability of the maximum likelihood (ML) detector are based mainly on the rank and the determinant criteria. In particular, the current STBC designs focus on full diversity and the non-vanishing determinant, since such codes enable the optimal tradeoff of diversity and multiplexing gains. In this paper, we consider a coherent communication system equipped with multiple transmitter antennas and a single receiver antenna, i.e., a MISO system. For such systems, Afarkhani, Tirkkonen-Boariu-Hottinen, and Papadias-Foschini proposed the quasi-orthogonal STBC designs with fast ML decoding. Su and Xia designed the rotated quasi-orthogonal STBCs enabling full diversity and optimal coding gain. However, the nearest neighbor number per symbol for this code tends to infinity when the size of constellation is large. Here, we explore a novel criterion to design rotated quasi-orthogonal STBCs. In addition to both maximizing the rank and the coding gain, our design attempts to make the average number of the nearest neighbors as small as possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069557/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702028","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Novel rotation angle for quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel rotation angle for quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569190087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055316S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010319","isNumber":"5069503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010319","xplore-issue":"5069503","articleId":"5069557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5069674,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Schairer","affiliation":["University of T\u00fcbingen WSI/GRIS, Germany"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Schairer","id":"37321500000"},{"name":"Benjamin Huhle","affiliation":["University of T\u00fcbingen WSI/GRIS, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Huhle","id":"37321498600"},{"name":"Wolfgang Strasser","affiliation":["Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Strasser"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4317-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4318-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2021"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-203X"}],"articleNumber":"5069674","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Cameras","Motion estimation","Quantization","Image registration","Image motion analysis","Robustness","Grid computing","Robot vision systems","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image registration","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional image accuracy orientation estimation","spherical Fourier transform","Fourier space problem","quantization steps","rotation estimation","equiangular grid","likelihood density mode","spherical video camera","ground-truth values","image registration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image registration","omnidirectional vision","spherical fourier transform","orientation estimation"]}],"abstract":"Orientation estimation based on image data is a key technique in many applications and robust estimates are possible in case of omnidirectional images.

Due to high memory demands, the Fourier-based solution can be computed on low-resolution input only and the resulting rotation estimate is given on an equiangular grid.

UAVs systems have been proposed for a wide range of applications such as mapping, surveillance, search, and tracking operations. The recent availability of low-cost UAVs suggests the use of teams of vehicles to perform sensing tasks. To leverage the capabilities of a team of vehicles, efficient methods of decentralized sensing and cooperative path planning are necessary. The goal of this work is to examine practical control strategies for a team of fixed-wing vehicles performing cooperative sensing. We seek to develop decentralized, autonomous control strategies that can account for a wide variety of sensing missions. Sensing goals are posed from an information theoretic standpoint to design strategies that explicitly minimize uncertainty. This work proposes a tightly coupled approach, in which sensor models and estimation objectives are used online for path planning.","doi":"10.1109/MRA.2009.932529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/100/5069815/05069834.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2009.932529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous UAV path planning and estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous UAV path planning and estimation","volume":"16","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10728562","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069834/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069834/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous UAV path planning and estimation","sourcePdf":"19-16mra02-tisdale.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050706S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"100","isNumber":"5069815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"100","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5069815","articleId":"5069834","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5069840,"authors":[{"name":"Robin R.

As a result, a single stage cell provides better resolution in comparison to previous works where cascading of multiple stages is necessary to improve resolution. This makes the circuit suitable for systems where silicon area and power consumption are constraints. Moreover, the feedback arrangement ensures a single loser. Simulations in Cadence show that a single cell can resolve voltage differences as small as 0.5 mV in around 50 ns with 1 pF load capacitance.

Simulation comparison of predicting performances shows that the improved neural network models with functional link ANN give a better performance in solving the wood moisture content prediction problem.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2009.5069936","startPage":"148","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2009.5069936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069900","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5039752/5069900/05069936.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison on prediction wood moisture content using ARIMA and improved neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069936/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison on prediction wood moisture content using ARIMA and improved neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069936/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10699479","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison on prediction wood moisture content using ARIMA and improved neural networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"1569186824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070822S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5039752","isNumber":"5069900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5039752","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5069900","articleId":"5069936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5069937,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Deng","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Hua Deng","id":"37305393500"},{"name":"Zhen Xu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Zhen Xu","id":"37306806600"},{"name":"Han-Xiong Li","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering & Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Han-Xiong","lastName":"Li","id":"37281092200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3819-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3820-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1547"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1555"}],"articleNumber":"5069937","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Neural networks","State-space methods","Nonlinear control systems","State estimation","Nonlinear systems","Uncertainty","Centralized control","Kalman filters","Observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","discrete time systems","distributed control","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","observers","process control","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO nonlinear process","neural network internal model control","multi input multi output system","non affine discrete-time state space","decoupling controller approximation","extended Kalman observer","distributed thermal process","nonlinear coupling suppression","distributed curing process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks","Internal model control","Nonlinear MIMO systems","Non-affine discrete-time nonlinear systems"]}],"abstract":"An internal model based neural network control is proposed for unknown multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear processes in non-affine discrete-time state space form under model mismatch and disturbances. Based on the neural state space model built for an unknown nonlinear MIMO state space process, an approximate internal model and approximate decoupling controllers are derived simultaneously. Thus, the learning of the inverse process dynamics is not required. The neural network model based extended Kalman observer is used to estimate the states of a nonlinear process as not all states are accessible. The application to a distributed thermal process shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach on suppressing nonlinear coupling and external disturbance and its feasibility to the control of non-affine nonlinear MIMO processes.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2009.5069937","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5039752/5069900/05069937.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2009.5069937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nueral network internal model control for MIMO nonlinear processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5069937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069937/","displayDocTitle":"Nueral network internal model control for MIMO nonlinear processes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10699480","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5069937/","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nueral network internal model control for MIMO nonlinear processes","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"1569186978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065634S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5039752","isNumber":"5069900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5039752","xplore-issue":"5069900","articleId":"5069937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5069942,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Depending on the prediction errors of the CNNs from one input sample to another, the AWF can adaptively adjust the weights which are assigned to the CNNs. The results of the function approximation experiments on six benchmark data sets demonstrate that the AWF method can effectively help the multi-learner system achieve higher accuracy (measured in terms of mean-squared error) of prediction, in comparison with the popular the Bagging algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2009.5069964","pdfPath":"/iel5/5039752/5069900/05069964.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"276","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2009.5069964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5069900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptively fusing neural network predictors toward higher accuracy: A case study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5069964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptively fusing neural network predictors toward higher accuracy: A case study","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10699507","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5069964/","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptively fusing neural network predictors toward higher accuracy: A case study","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"1569188430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06123S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5039752","isNumber":"5069900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5039752","xplore-issue":"5069900","articleId":"5069964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
