Although its final objective is to develop some cost-area-effective system-on-chip (SoC) solutions, the technique applied is a new concept for digital control. It shows that control laws can be efficiently implemented with 1-bit signals at both the input and output. At the same time, the silicon area can be significantly reduced when realising controllers on FPGAs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (IEEE Cat.

An entirely unsupervised study strategy is adopted directly so that the system knowledge does not need to be realized in advance. In some real-world physical chaotic systems, it is difficult to determine the key parameters, so the proposed method can be applied to more practical situations. The algorithm convergence performance has been analyzed carefully and the severe proofs have been given.

The main objective is to estimate the amplitude and the latency of the single trial EP response without losing the individual properties of each epoch, which is important for practical clinical applications. Based on the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), a method in terms of normalised RBFNN was proposed to obtain preferable results against other nonlinear methods such as ANC with RBFNN prefilter and RBFNN. The performance of the proposed methods was also evaluated with MSE and the ability of tracking peaks. The experimental results provide convergent evidence that the NRBFNN can significantly attenuate the noise and successfully identify the variance between trials.

Several studies have shown that these network features may be correlated and present a certain degree of memory such as bursty losses and delays. The memory and the statistical dependence between losses and temporal delays suggest that the channel may be well modelled by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with appropriate hidden variables that captures the current state of the network. In this paper we propose an HMM that, trained with a modified version of the EM-algorithm, shows excellent performance in modelling typical channel behaviors in a set of real packet links.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

In this paper, we use the eigenspace based principal component (PC) and cross-spectral (CS) method for rank-reduction of a matrix Wiener filter (WF) which estimates a signal vector instead of a scalar by minimizing the mean square error. Finally, we apply the resulting filters to a frequency-flat multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission channel. Although the matrix PC algorithm is computationally cheaper than the matrix CS algorithm, we have shown through analysis that the two methods are equal if we assume i.i.d. transmit symbols and uncorrelated white Gaussian noise. Simulation results have shown that the matrix multi-stage WF (MSWF), which approximates the WF in a Krylov subspace, is partially outperformed in the considered MIMO case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On reduced-rank approaches to matrix Wiener filters in MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

In this paper, we propose a new and faster sphere decoding algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where it's complexity is much less than the conventional algorithm. In our method, the initial selection of the sphere radius is not important. It is shown that both the performance and the complexity of the proposed algorithm are simultaneously controlled by two parameters. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the performance and the complexity in the proposed algorithm. By computer simulations, we have shown that the performance of our method is very close to ML decoding algorithm. Furthermore, if we tolerate some degradation in the performance, we can speed up the proposed algorithm to ten times. Our results have shown that even in the fastest case, the novel decoder outperforms the V-BLAST decoding algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to construct an OSTBC with a transmission rate equal to one for more than two transmit antennas. A way to achieve the transmission rates equal to one is to use the quasi-orthogonal STBC (QSTBC). In previous works, it was shown by simulations that the performance of QSTBC can be improved by rotating the constellation of some symbols in the so called transmit matrix. We analyze two different performance criteria proposed in the literature concerning this rotation. We derive an optima with respect to these criteria and show their impact on the bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, we derive some analytical results for the BER-performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341070","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

The receiver as well as the transmitter have perfect channel state information. We are interested in the limits of the MIMO channel capacity under the different types of noise plus interference. Therefore, we consider three scenarios in which the noise is subject to different constraints. In all scenarios the achievable capacity of the MIMO system with worst case noise is equal to the capacity of some MIMO system in which either the channels are orthogonal or the transmit antennas are not allowed to cooperate.

Previous results concerning the spatial multiplexing optimization are used to address the joint problem of carrier assignment and choice of beamforming weights in a multi user MIMO system. For practical reasons, the joint optimization is divided into two parts: subcarrier assignment based on beamformer characteristics to adjust the carrier load, followed by beamforming optimization with subcarrier reassignment. The goal is to minimize total downlink transmit power while keeping the fixed user data rates. The proposed multiplexing scheme is evaluated on a number of numerical examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint space-frequency optimization in multi user MIMO system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

Motivated by the insight that this behavior is mainly caused by poorly conditioned channel realizations, we propose the line-search detector (LSD) that is robust to poorly conditioned channels. The LSD uses a 1-D nearest neighbor search along the least significant singular vector of the channel matrix. It exhibits near-ML performance and has significantly lower complexity than the sphere-decoding algorithm for ML detection.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341117","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

The problem arises when different height contributions collapse in the same range-azimuth resolution cell, due to the presence of strong terrain slopes or discontinuities in the sensed scene. Several multilook approaches have recently been suggested to counter act the presence of speckle, exploiting a repeated uniform spatial sampling of the baseline. In practice, the baseline steering vectors will generally be imprecise, resulting in array miscalibration. Herein, we propose a non-parametric multilook approach based on robust Capon beamforming, allowing for uncertainty in the steering vectors.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341125","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

These channels occur in mobile communications at very high velocities. We approach the problem by estimating the spreading function, which is limited in delay and Doppler frequency and therefore lends itself to sampling. A training sequence is assumed to be transmitted in parallel to the data sequence. The estimation is carried out in the time domain and derived for direct sequence spread spectrum systems as well as unspread systems. The estimation of the spreading coefficients results in an improved channel estimation by reconstruction of the impulse response. As an application, the channel estimator is tested in a UMTS terrestrial radio access (UTRA) frequency division duplex (FDD) uplink multiuser environment, where the multiple users are assumed to be totally asynchronous.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9296/29546/01341129.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"350","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

This method is applicable for any given set of spreading codes, but in this paper only Walsh Hadamard (WH) and Gold codes are analyzed. The multiple access interference (MAI) powers produced at every possible asynchronous timing misalignment of each interferer are estimated. The final BER distribution is generated from the pdf of the total MAI power incurred by the reference user. System performances are compared for both types of spreading codes with different spreading factors. The mean BER results show that the MC-CDMA scheme considered outperforms the DS-CDMA in the mean case for the use of both Walsh Hadamard and Gold codes. It is therefore concluded that the MC-CDMA scheme considered offers higher MAI resistance than conventional DS-CDMA in an asynchronous environment for the considered codes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341137","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

For this reason some pilot redundancy is present when Doppler spread is lower than the expected maximum. So it is worth providing a Doppler spread estimate to tune the channel estimation and exploit the possible aforementioned redundancy. This work presents a method to adaptively tune the pilot-aided channel estimation on the basis of the channel Doppler spread in turn estimated by means of a modified zero-crossing method. Zero-crossing method is very attractive be cause of its low complexity, but it suffers from bias in the case of noise. In this study the method has been modified to face very noisy conditions by introducing a correcting factor depending on the SNR. The application of this method in a RAKE receiver designed for UMTS FDD base station is presented herein.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

We introduce the concept of space sampling at the receiver where antennas are placed relatively close to each other. Since the antennas are close, the samples are highly spatially correlated and does not help in performance improvement in a typical wireless system with flat fading. However, this concept is very useful particularly in an OFDM system with frequency selective fading which has an inherent multipath diversity. Under these circumstances, the required space diversity for performance improvement is obtained by the transformation of multipath diversity to useful space diversity in frequency domain inherently by an OFDM system (G. V. Rangaraj et al., June 2003). The minimum separation required between the antennas under such circumstances is derived analytically and we have show that even with a separation of only 0.44/spl lambda/, the required spatial correlation in the frequency domain becomes sufficiently low.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing space sampling for OFDM systems with multipath diversity","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

This paper proposes a novel iterative blind source separation algorithm, called a turbo source separation algorithm (TSSA), which alternatively involves spatial processing as the FKMA, and temporal processing (blind deconvolution) using Chi and Cheri's fast inverse filter criteria algorithm at each iteration.

The pilot sequences on the S-CPICH are transmitted over a fixed grid of beams, causing a systematic channel estimation error at the receiver. Consequently, the adapted rake receiver coefficients will be corrupted due to the use of the S-CPICH, which will lead to an incoherent superposition of the signal components when conventional adaptive space time precoders are employed. Assuming partial channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter we show how the effect of S-CPICH based channel estimation can be reduced or even removed, resulting in an enhanced system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341182","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

The performance improvement obtained from the transformation methods is compared with that from the method, which directly uses the uplink covariance matrix for downlink beamforming. For this purpose, a dynamic system level simulator developed for investigating the capacity improvement of a UMTS-FDD system employing smart antennas at the base stations is used. Downlink capacity is considered as a measure of the performance of the system by finding the number of users for which a certain quality of service (QoS) requirement is fulfilled. System level simulations are carried out for antenna arrays with 2, 4 and 8 elements. Simulation results show the necessity of robust transformation methods for the improvement of the downlink capacity, when the uplink signature is not known exactly at the base station (BS).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29546","startPage":"568","endPage":"571","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

Hence, especially in \"data only\" networks, an efficient uplink scheduling must not be neglected in the network design. Although not yet well covered in the literature, this area appears to gain importance especially in the face of high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) radio link design for future wireless systems. In this work we study an uplink scheduling scheme from the information theoretic and queueing theoretic point of view. The objective of the cross-layer (Goldsmith, A.J. et al., 2003) scheduling approach we present is the stability of bit-queues awaiting their transmission at every user node. With this approach is associated an optimization problem of maximizing the weighted sum of rates, where the weights express the intensity of packet-traffics at every user node. An important property characterizing our approach is considering only spatial channelization of users, i.e. allocating user signals within one successive interference cancellation (SIC) order fixed over a certain time interval T. We show, that despite this neglection of time sharing technique, it is possible to achieve an overall optimal stability achieving scheduling for every set of user rate weights. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the SIC-order allowing for the optimal scheduling is independent of user channels and that the associated optimization problem over transmit covariance matrices is convex.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341186","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (IEEE Cat.

Many MIMO transmission schemes proposed in the literature are, however, based on idealized assumptions. Several effects that may occur in a practical system, such as intersymbol interference, nonperfect channel knowledge, fast fading, and correlation between the individual transmission paths, significantly influence system performance. On the basis of two particularly simple but nonetheless efficient MIMO transmission schemes, the above effects are illustrated, and possible countermeasures are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting the performance of wireless communication systems: theory and practice of multiple-antenna techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2004.1341259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/29548/01341259.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2004.1341259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29548","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341259/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Boosting the performance of wireless communication systems: theory and practice of multiple-antenna techniques","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1341259/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155621","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting the performance of wireless communication systems: theory and practice of multiple-antenna techniques","sourcePdf":"01341259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051899S","chronDate":"Oct.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"29548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"29548","articleId":"1341259","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1341260,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the case of a multiple-input multiple-output channel, feedback can be used to specify a precoding matrix at the transmitter, which activates the strongest channel modes. In situations where the feedback is severely limited, important issues are how to quantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in associated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback available. We give an overview of some recent work in this area. Methods are presented for constructing a set of possible precoding matrices, from which a particular choice can be relayed to the transmitter.

As a result, the study of multi-user MIMO systems has emerged recently as an important research topic. Such systems have the potential to combine the high capacity achievable with MIMO processing with the benefits of space-division multiple access. In this article we review several algorithms that have been proposed with this goal in mind. We describe two classes of solutions. The first uses a signal processing approach with various types of transmitter beamforming. The second uses \"dirty paper\" coding to overcome the interference a user sees from signals intended for other users.

The second approach is based on distributed arithmetic read only memory (ROM), accumulator structure and offset binary coding (OBC) techniques. Implementations of the algorithms on a Xilinx FPGA are described. The distributed arithmetic approach exhibits better performances when compared with the systolic architecture approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 International Conference on Visual Information Engineering VIE 2003","pdfPath":"/iel5/9297/29549/01341311.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2003 International Conference on Visual Information Engineering VIE 2003","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20030506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29549","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA based system for discrete Hartley transforms","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Hartley transforms","field programmable gate arrays","systolic arrays","distributed arithmetic","binary codes","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Hartley transforms","image processing","signal processing","systolic architecture","distributed arithmetic design methodologies","Baugh-Wooley algorithm","distributed arithmetic read only memory","accumulator structure","offset binary coding","Xilinx FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2003","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA based system for discrete Hartley transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"7726614","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA based system for discrete Hartley transforms","confLoc":"Guildford, UK","sourcePdf":"01341311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02772S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2003","isNumber":"29549","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9297","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1341311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1341312,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

One successful approach is to use iterative search methods such as genetic algorithms. However, they can be computationally exhaustive taking weeks to converge. Parallel genetic algorithms give massive reductions in processing time, but their performance when implemented on multiprocessor systems or cluster of workstations has a heavy dependence on the number of servers. Also, they require some sort of synchronisation between the working processors. Because of their parallel capabilities, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide a cheap and efficient way to implement parallel algorithms. In this paper, a realisation of the genetic algorithm on an FPGA is introduced. The genetic algorithm is given the task of optimising a grey-scale soft morphological filter. The soft morphological filter is implemented using a parallel quick sorting algorithm. The results of synthesizing and simulating the design on SPARTAN II FPGA resulted in a good utilisation of the device resources. Also, the optimisation process was performed in a very short time. In contrast with the standard parallel genetic algorithms, the design does not require any synchronisation or management schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA realisation of the genetic algorithm for the design of grey-scale soft morphological filters","publicationTitle":"2003 International Conference on Visual Information Engineering VIE 2003","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030507","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 International Conference on Visual Information Engineering VIE 2003","pdfPath":"/iel5/9297/29549/01341312.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20030507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29549","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2003","displayDocTitle":"FPGA realisation of the genetic algorithm for the design of grey-scale soft morphological filters","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"7726615","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA realisation of the genetic algorithm for the design of grey-scale soft morphological filters","confLoc":"Guildford, UK","sourcePdf":"01341312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037221S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2003","isNumber":"29549","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9297","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1341312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1341318,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The variable initial resetting state errors at the beginning of each trial is considered. To overcome the initial errors, a time-varying boundary layer is introduced to design an error function. Based on the error function, the main structure of this controller is constructed by a fuzzy iterative learning component and a feedback stabilization component. The fuzzy system is used as an approximator to compensate for the plant unknown nonlinearity. Since the optimal parameters for a good fuzzy approximation are in general unavailable, the adaptive algorithms are derived along the iteration axis to search for suitable parameter values and then guarantee the closed-loop stability and learning convergence. It is shown that all the adjustable parameters as well as internal signals remain bounded for all iterations. There even exist initial state errors, the norm of tracking error vector will asymptotically converge to a tunable residual set as iteration goes to infinity and the learning speed can be easily improved if the learning gain is large.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.834806","startPage":"724","endPage":"732","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/29553/01341438.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.834806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy system-based adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear plants with initial state errors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Error correction","Feedback","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy systems","adaptive control","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy system","adaptive iterative learning control","nonLipschitz nonlinear plants","time varying boundary layer","error function","adaptive algorithm","closed loop stability","initial state error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy system-based adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear plants with initial state errors","volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1341438/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8167541","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy system-based adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear plants with initial state errors","sourcePdf":"01341438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095474S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"29553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"29553","articleId":"1341438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1341439,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/29553/1341439/1341439-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Min Lin (S'86\u2013M'87\u2013S'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1981, 1983, and 1986, respectively.","During 1986\u20131992, he was with the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Taiwan, as a Deputy Director of system engineering of missile systems.

In this paper, a supervisory recurrent fuzzy neural network control (SRFNNC) system is developed to control the wing rock system. This SRFNNC system is comprised of a recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) controller and a supervisory controller. The RFNN controller is investigated to mimic an ideal controller and the supervisory controller is designed to compensate for the approximation error between the RFNN controller and the ideal controller. The RFNN is inherently a recurrent multilayered neural network for realizing fuzzy inference using dynamic fuzzy rules. Moreover, an on-line parameter training methodology, using the gradient descent method and the Lyapunov stability theorem, is proposed to increase the learning capability. Finally, a comparison between the sliding-mode control, the fuzzy sliding control and the proposed SRFNNC of a wing rock system is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the SRFNNC system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design method can achieve favorable control performance for the wing rock system without the knowledge of system dynamic functions.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.834803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/29553/01341439.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.834803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29553","startPage":"733","endPage":"742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervisory recurrent fuzzy neural network control of wing rock for slender delta wings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Supervisory recurrent fuzzy neural network control of wing rock for slender delta wings","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8167542","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1341439/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervisory recurrent fuzzy neural network control of wing rock for slender delta wings","sourcePdf":"01341439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092933S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"29553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"29553","articleId":"1341439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1341447,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators are shown to have orders-of-magnitude higher energy storage capability than flexural beam resonators. The bifurcation point for the silicon BAW resonators is measured and the maximum vibration amplitude is shown to approach the intrinsic material limit. The importance of nonlinearities in setting the limit for vibration energy storage is demonstrated in oscillator applications. The phase noise calculated for silicon microresonator-based oscillators is compared to the conventional macroscopic quartz-based oscillators, and it is shown that the higher energy density attainable with the silicon resonators can partially compensate for the small microresonator size.

The performance of the microjet heat sinks is studied using the integrated heater device as well as an industry standard 1 cm/sup 2/ thermal test chip. For single-phase, the silicon temperature distribution data are consistent with a model accounting for silicon conduction and fluid advection using convection coefficients in the range from 0.072 to 4.4 W/cm/sup 2/K. For two-phase, the experimental results show a heat removal of up to 90 W on a 1 cm/sup 2/ heated area using a four-jet array with 76 /spl mu/m diameter orifices at a flowrate of 8 ml/min with a temperature rise of 100/spl deg/C.

Simulations show that gain-flattened broad-band Raman amplification, using a single pump, can be achieved in any wavelength band by suitably choosing the fiber parameters and the pump wavelength. The fiber also has a high negative dispersion coefficient-(380-515) ps/km/spl middot/nm over the operating range of wavelengths-and the shape of the dispersion curve is such that the total link dispersion can be not only compensated but also flattened. Hence, the designed fiber can serve as a lossless, broad-band, dispersion-flattening, and dispersion-compensating module for the S band, wherein lossless operation is achieved using inherently gain-flattened single-pump Raman amplification. The performance characteristics of such a module was modeled taking into account wavelength-dependent splice loss as well as background loss, and it has been shown through simulations that lossless operation with /spl plusmn/0.2-dB gain ripple is achievable over (1480-1511) nm using a single pump. Moreover, dispersion compensation for five spans of transmission in a 10-Gb/s system, over this 32-nm bandwidth in the S band, should be attainable using the proposed design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Bandwidth","Optical amplifiers","Shape","Wavelength division multiplexing","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Dispersion","Performance loss","Optical losses","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical design techniques","Raman lasers","optical pumping","optical fibre dispersion","Raman spectra","optical fibre losses","optical fibre communication","optical fibre amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber design","flat gain Raman amplification","dispersion compensation","S band","Raman gain spectrum","single pump Raman amplification","splice loss","background loss","lossless operation","gain ripple","Raman amplifiers","gain flattening","1480 to 1511 nm","10 Gbit/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2004.833528","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/29555/01341479.pdf","startPage":"2279","endPage":"2286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2004.833528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel fiber design for flat gain Raman amplification using single pump and dispersion compensation in S band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel fiber design for flat gain Raman amplification using single pump and dispersion compensation in S band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341479/","volume":"22","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1341479/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8136608","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel fiber design for flat gain Raman amplification using single pump and dispersion compensation in S band","sourcePdf":"01341479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039497S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"29555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"29555","articleId":"1341479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1341535,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A well-characterized exposure system is crucial for interpreting the biological outcomes of experiments. This paper describes a novel waveguide-based exposure system that permits perfusion of the cells with a temperature-controlled balanced salt solution for online monitoring of catecholamine release from the cells during radio frequency/microwave exposure. The finite-difference time-domain method was used to optimize the exposure conditions, the goal being to achieve the maximum possible homogeneity in the distribution of the specific absorption rate at the location of the cells in the waveguide. At a frequency of 1 GHz, optimal coupling of the radio frequency/microwave field into the region containing the cells was obtained only when the cells were placed at the location of the electric field maximum of the standing wave pattern, with the electric field parallel to the plane containing the cells. In this case, the specific absorption rate distribution was found to be the highest as well as homogeneous to within 30%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/29557/01341535.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2004.832699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2004.832699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel waveguide-based radio frequency/microwave exposure system for studying nonthermal effects on neurotransmitter Release-finite-difference time-domain modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Neurotransmitters","Time domain analysis","Cells (biology)","Radiofrequency identification","Bovine","In vitro","Biological system modeling","Finite difference methods","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological effects of microwaves","neurophysiology","finite difference time-domain analysis","cellular effects of radiation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide-based radiofrequency exposure system","waveguide-based microwave exposure system","neurotransmitter release","finite-difference time-domain modeling","nonthermal effects","catecholamines","cultured bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells","cell perfusion","temperature-controlled balanced salt solution","absorption rate distribution","0.75 to 1.12 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"A novel waveguide-based radio frequency/microwave exposure system for studying nonthermal effects on neurotransmitter Release-finite-difference time-domain modeling","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1341535/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","accessionNumber":"8138403","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel waveguide-based radio frequency/microwave exposure system for studying nonthermal effects on neurotransmitter Release-finite-difference time-domain modeling","sourcePdf":"01341535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069381S","chronDate":"Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"29557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"29557","articleId":"1341535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1341560,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Under a bounded power rate of change constraint, the stochastic control problem and its associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation are analyzed by the viscosity solution method; then the degenerate HJB equation is perturbed to admit a classical solution and a suboptimal control law is designed based on the perturbed HJB equation. When a quadratic type cost is used without a bound constraint on the control, the value function is a classical solution to the degenerate HJB equation and the feedback control is affine in the system power. In addition, in this case we develop approximate, but highly scalable, solutions to the HJB equation in terms of a local polynomial expansion of the exact solution. When the channel parameters are not known a priori, one can obtain on-line estimates of the parameters and get adaptive versions of the control laws. In numerical experiments with both of the above cost functions, the following phenomenon is observed: whenever the users have different initial conditions, there is an initial convergence of the power levels to a common level and then subsequent approximately equal behavior which converges toward a stochastically varying optimum.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink power adjustment in wireless communication systems: a stochastic control analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2004.835388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/29559/01341563.pdf","startPage":"1693","endPage":"1708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2004.835388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Uplink power adjustment in wireless communication systems: a stochastic control analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1341563/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8194834","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink power adjustment in wireless communication systems: a stochastic control analysis","sourcePdf":"01341563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165773S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"29559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"29559","articleId":"1341563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1341571,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jing Zhou","id":"37087494870"},{"name":"Changyun Wen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Changyun Wen","id":"37087158096"},{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"lastName":"Ying Zhang","id":"37087253411"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"1341571","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":426,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2812},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Backstepping","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Hysteresis","Differential equations","Robust control","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","uncertain systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","hysteresis","differential equations","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive backstepping control","uncertain dynamic nonlinear system","unknown backlash like hysteresis","differential equation","bounded external disturbance","global stability"]}],"abstract":"In this note, we consider the same class of systems as in a previous paper, i.e., a class of uncertain dynamic nonlinear systems preceded by unknown backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearities, where the hysteresis is modeled by a differential equation, in the presence of bounded external disturbances.

This paper addresses the development of a new type of dielectric chip antenna known as integrated circuit package antenna (ICPA) for highly integrated RF transceivers. A compact ICPA of this type has, for the first time, been designed and fabricated in a ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) package format. The novel ICPA, except economical advantage of mass production and automatic assembly, has potential benefit to the system-level board miniaturization and the system-level manufacturing facilitation. The simulated and measured antenna performance of the ICPA is presented. The effects of the different physical parts of the ICPA on the antenna performance are investigated. Results show that the ICPA achieved impedance bandwidth of 4.1% and radiation efficiency of 72%, and gain of 4.8 dBi at 5.715 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.834427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.834427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29560/01341607.pdf","startPage":"2538","endPage":"2544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated circuit ceramic ball grid array package antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Integrated circuit ceramic ball grid array package antenna","volume":"52","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8138184","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1341607/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated circuit ceramic ball grid array package antenna","sourcePdf":"01341607.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05049S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"29560","articleId":"1341607","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1341616,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xu","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Poly-Grames Research Center D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/29560/1341616/1341616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Xu was born in Jiangsu, China.

The idea of domain decomposition is introduced to divide the sparse problem domain into several subdomains. All of subdomains are connected by means of the 2-D time domain Green's function. As a result, a great deal of meshes memory between cylinders is removed, especially when the distances between cylinders become large. Furthermore, the coupling between cylinders can be regarded as the equivalent cylindrical wave irradiations. The incident signals of the equivalent cylindrical waves are expressed as cylindrical wave input field array (CWIFA) according to Huygens principle. Then the calculation time is significantly reduced. The near-field to far-field transformation is used to obtain the equivalent cylindrical wave; as a result, the calculation time can be reduced further. The new method has been demonstrated in 2-D multicylinders scattering problem. Numerical results are in good agreement with the results obtained using classical FDTD method and moment of methods (MM).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29560/01341616.pdf","startPage":"2612","endPage":"2617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.834435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.834435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29560","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of two dimensions sparse multicylinder scattering problem using DD-FDTD method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Two dimensional displays","Electromagnetic scattering","Discrete wavelet transforms","Green function","Mutual coupling","Computational electromagnetics","Laboratories","Millimeter wave technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","sparse matrices","Green's function methods","method of moments","electromagnetic wave scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional domain decomposition finite-difference time-domain","DD-FDTD","sparse multicylinders scattering problem","Green's function method","equivalent cylindrical wave","cylindrical wave input field array","CWIFA","Huygens principle","method of moments","MoM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of two dimensions sparse multicylinder scattering problem using DD-FDTD method","volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1341616/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8138193","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of two dimensions sparse multicylinder scattering problem using DD-FDTD method","sourcePdf":"01341616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039223S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"29560","articleId":"1341616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1341623,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed scheme is the extension of the frequency-domain adaptive integral/pre-corrected fast-Fourier transform (FFT) method to the time domain. Fields on the scatterer that are produced by space-time sources residing on its surface are computed: 1) by locally projecting, for each time step, all sources onto a uniform auxiliary grid that encases the scatterer; 2) by computing everywhere on this grid the transient fields produced by the resulting auxiliary sources via global, multilevel/blocked, space-time FFTs; 3) by locally interpolating these fields back onto the scatterer surface. As this procedure is inaccurate when source and observer points reside close to each other; and 4) near fields are computed classically, albeit (pre-)corrected, for errors introduced through the use of global FFTs. The proposed scheme has a computational complexity and memory requirement of O(N/sub t/N/sub s/log/sup 2/N/sub s/) and O(N/sub s//sup 3/2/) when applied to quasiplanar structures, and of O(N/sub t/N/sub s//sup 3/2/log/sup 2/N/sub s/) and O(N/sub s//sup 2/) when used to analyze scattering from general surfaces. Here, N/sub s/ and N/sub t/ denote the number of spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of the surface current density. These computational cost and memory requirements are contrasted to those of classical MOT solvers, which scale as O(N/sub t/N/sub s//sup 2/) and O(N/sub s//sup 2/), respectively. A parallel implementation of the scheme on a distributed-memory computer cluster that uses the message-passing interface is described. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and the parallel performance of the implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.834399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29560/01341626.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.834399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time domain adaptive integral method for surface integral equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341626/","displayDocTitle":"Time domain adaptive integral method for surface integral equations","volume":"52","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8138203","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1341626/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time domain adaptive integral method for surface integral equations","sourcePdf":"01341626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110945S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"29560","articleId":"1341626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1341627,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

GA is first used to optimize the impedance matching bandwidth of two particular planar element shapes, the bow-tie (BT) and reverse bow-tie (RBT). The results of this study indicate that the RBT can achieve a significantly wider bandwidth with a much smaller size than the traditional BT. In a follow-on study, GA is used to generate arbitrarily shaped planar monopole designs, which exhibit improved broadband performance and/or reduced size compared with the RBT. The designs generated by the GA demonstrate a better tradeoff between matching bandwidth and electrical size compared with planar monopole designs previously characterized in the literature. Analysis of results from simulation and measurement are presented, which provide insight into the operation of these antennas as well as the key parameters that lead to improved performance.

The optical zooming mechanisms provide this additional information, however, when optically zoomed, the camera no longer detects the full frame view, which was detected before zooming. Digital zooming can detect the full view at all times, however, fails to provide additional visual information when zoomed. In applications such as visual surveillance and manufacturing quality measurement, it is required to detect the full frame view at all times, the camera should be capable of providing additional visual information when zoomed to the region of interest (ROI). This paper presents a video camera system incorporating an autonomous pan, tilt and zoom functionality based on ROI decided upon motion detection capability, which provides more visual information in zoomed modes while detecting the full view at all times. The intelligent ROI decision can be made not only based on motion but also shape, color, sizes etc. of targeted objects for tracking. Image sharpening and noise reduction methods are also provided within the camera system. Standard testing results indicate that this camera system can resolve up to 800 TV lines and produces comparable color quality to other CCD based CCTV surveillance cameras, especially at good lighting conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2004.1341679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/29562/01341679.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2004.1341679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29562","startPage":"777","endPage":"786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital zoom camera with image sharpening and suppression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital zoom camera with image sharpening and suppression","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","accessionNumber":"8130324","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1341679/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital zoom camera with image sharpening and suppression","sourcePdf":"01341679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056312S","chronDate":"Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"29562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"29562","articleId":"1341679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1341681,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

However, in the time domain, the OFDM signal has a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAR), which translates to low power amplifier efficiencies.

We also relate any power savings to the computational power costs of selected mapping, which is a prominent PAR reduction scheme that results in negligible performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2004.1341681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/29562/01341681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2004.1341681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29562","startPage":"792","endPage":"798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power savings analysis of peak-to-average power ratio in OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power savings analysis of peak-to-average power ratio in OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","accessionNumber":"8130326","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1341681/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power savings analysis of peak-to-average power ratio in OFDM","sourcePdf":"01341681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072183S","chronDate":"Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"29562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"29562","articleId":"1341681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1341682,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/29562/1341682/1341682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nJie Zhang was born in Huaibei, Anhui province, P.

OFDM-based multi-carrier systems are much more sensitive to the nonlinear distortion at the transmitter and the imperfect parameters estimation at the receiver than the single carrier systems. In this paper, the compositive performance effects induced on the OFDM signal by the nonlinear distortion and the imperfect parameters estimation are investigated, a closed form of symbol error probability of the OFDM-based system with nonlinear distortion and imperfect parameters estimation is derived. Theoretical results show closely matching with those obtained by simulations for the OFDM-based system with QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM modulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of the OFDM-based systems with nonlinear distortion and imperfect parameters estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2004.1341688","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/29562/01341688.pdf","startPage":"835","endPage":"843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2004.1341688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of the OFDM-based systems with nonlinear distortion and imperfect parameters estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1341688/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2004","publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","accessionNumber":"8130333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of the OFDM-based systems with nonlinear distortion and imperfect parameters estimation","sourcePdf":"01341688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068531S","chronDate":"Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"29562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29562","articleId":"1341688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1341705,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Yung Hsiao","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan, ROC"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/29562/1341705/1341705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei-Yung Hsiao (M'04) was born on January 5, 1957 in Taiwan, ROC.

The algorithm embedded the selective attention model in the NN training. The key to this algorithm lies in the pre-attention function, in which primitive features of the stimulus were detected in parallel by what might be called feature detectors by an improved GA, and the attention function, in which detail features were handled with the attention spotlight by the BP with an enlarged error item in the output layer. Therefore, the SABP obtained the ability of searching the global optimum solution relying on the pre-attention function that made a lower fault rate to drop into local optimum, and the attention function updated the weights of neural network effectively by enlarging the error in the output layer, which kept a high leaning rate to meet the convergence criteria quickly. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is more powerful than Momentum algorithm or Delta-bar-Delta rule in learning, and it can effectively avoid failure training caused by randomizing the initial weights and thresholds, and solve the slow convergence problem resulting from the Flat-Spots when the error signal becomes too small.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2004.1341934","pdfPath":"/iel5/9294/29572/01341934.pdf","startPage":"2009","endPage":"2013 Vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (IEEE Cat.

However, its quality factor is severely degraded by skin effect of metal traces and substrate coupling effect in radio frequency band, and a key problem when designing SIOS is to find optimal parameters to enhance the quality factor subject to some constraints. The optimization problem is formulated, which belongs to the class of nonlinear combinational optimization. Though some optimization algorithms have been proposed, they cannot perform global search to find more general parameters. This paper proposes a global optimization technique based on genetic algorithm, where all SIOS parameters are represented as chromosomes on which genetic operators are repeatedly applied to find better solutions. Experimental results show that genetic algorithm can effectively find out the optimal parameters to enhance the quality factor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Spirals","Inductors","Silicon","Algorithm design and analysis","Q factor","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Degradation","Skin effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon","elemental semiconductors","inductors","radiofrequency integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","genetic algorithms","circuit optimisation","Q-factor","skin effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global genetic algorithm","global optimization technique","spiral inductor on silicon design parameters","radiofrequency integrated circuits","quality factor","skin effect","metal traces","substrate coupling effect","radiofrequency band","optimal parameters","nonlinear combinational optimization","optimization algorithms","chromosomes","genetic operators","Si"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2004.1341954","startPage":"2095","endPage":"2098 Vol.3","publicationTitle":"Fifth World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (IEEE Cat.

The optimized design parameters are the input fuzzy sets and the linear consequent of the rules. The DNA-GA uses virus DNA encoding method stemmed from the structure of the biological DNA. Specifically, we use the frameshift decoding method of the virus DNA to encode the design parameters of the fuzzy controllers. The genetic operators of the method are based on the DNA genetic operations. Another novel aspect of our method is the introduction of an adaptive mutation rate, which is tuned by using a fuzzy logic technique. Our encoding method can significantly shorten the code length of DNA chromosomes and is suitable for complex knowledge representation.

It is sometimes possible that the method of econometrics does not obtain the optimal parameters. To solve the problem, this paper puts forward improved genetic algorithm (IGA) which is suitable for the estimation of the parameters of nonlinear and linear demand functions. IGA has the mechanism combining the global optimization with the local optimization, and IGA is capable of revising the parameters many times under the instruction of system errors. So far as the linear estimation of parameters is concerned, the time complexity of IGA is O(n). It is also less than that of the method of econometrics which is O(n/sup 2/). The simulation example shows that the system error of IGA is 0.405680 which is less than 0.41057 derived from the method of econometrics. Therefore IGA is efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1341969/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8152855","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1341969/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved genetic algorithm for estimation of parameters of demand functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved genetic algorithm for estimation of parameters of demand functions","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"01341969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055304S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9294","isNumber":"29572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9294","xplore-issue":"29572","articleId":"1341969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1341972,"authors":[{"name":"Guojin Li","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Guojin Li","id":"37087494255"},{"name":"Guorong Wang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Guorong Wang","id":"37087352901"},{"name":"Jiguang Zhong","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Jiguang Zhong","id":"37087494383"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8273-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1341972","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Welding","Image segmentation","Histograms","Pixel","Educational institutions","Engines","Image analysis","Productivity","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image segmentation","welding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","welding seam image segmentation","threshold segmentation","Otsu method","gray level distribution","welding seam image analysis","adaptive threshold selection method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1341972","abstract":"Threshold segmentation is widely used in image segmentation because of its simplicity and efficiency.

It is desirable to find as much as possible Pareto-optimal solutions, and it is also highly expected to find the ones scattered uniformly over the Pareto frontier such that a variety of compromise solutions can be provided to the decision maker. For this purpose, an evolutionary programming algorithm, called evolutionary programming based on uniform design (UDEP), is proposed in this paper. Uniform design technique is used to define some fitness functions which can guide the search evenly toward the Pareto frontier. In order to overcome premature and provide as much as possible candidate solutions evenly scattered in the whole search space, uniform design technique, variable region search, as well as niche technique are used. Uniform design makes it possible to explore the search space evenly, while variable region search and niche technique help to keep diversity of the population. Their combination improves the search ability of EP (evolutionary programming) significantly.

Among the many open issues to be addressed in the development of UAVs is that of path planning. Different from the past researches, the problems presented in this paper include not only the single-mission path planning in a known environment, but also the path replanning in uncertain and mission-changeable environment. In this paper, a hybrid path replanning algorithm is proposed, which is based on roadmap-diagram. The path planning process is split into two phases: the learning phase and the query phase. Environmental information and mission constraints of UAVs are integrated into building flight roadmap and searching for paths. The implementation and experiments have demonstrated that this hybrid algorithm is an efficient, robust algorithm that is able to handle different kinds of mission parameters and generate near-optimal paths with computation times that are acceptable for real-time in-flight applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Path planning","Military computing","Weapons","Robustness","Hybrid power systems","Remotely operated vehicles","Road vehicles","Reconnaissance","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remotely operated vehicles","path planning","military aircraft","optimisation","aerospace computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path replanning algorithm","roadmap diagram","unmanned air vehicles","military applications","path planning","learning phase","query phase","hybrid algorithm","robust algorithm"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2004.1342031","startPage":"2433","endPage":"2437 Vol.3","publicationTitle":"Fifth World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (IEEE Cat.

In this study, CHNN is designed to perform the function of an optimal controller. The CHNN is constructed by establishing the equivalence between linear quadratic (LQ) optimal performance index of control system and the energy function of CHNN. Stability of the CHNN is analyzed from a theoretical perspective, too. As a result, solving LQ dynamic tracking optimal problem is equivalent to operating associated Hopfield network from its initial state to the terminal state that represents the optimal control sequence. In order to extend optimal control from finite time horizon into infinite time horizon and realize closed loop control, an online rolling optimization algorithm is applied. Numerical simulation shows that the design method above is correct and feasible.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2004.1342066","startPage":"2598","endPage":"2602 Vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (IEEE Cat.

The ideal feedback linearization control law is designed based on the backstepping technique. Moreover, to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertainty, which comprises a minimum approximation error, optimal parameter vectors and higher-order terms in Taylor series, a RFNN control system with adaptive bound estimation is investigated where a simple adaptive algorithm is utilized to estimate the bound of uncertainty.

This paper proposes a fuzzy logic based PMSM DTC system, in which the torque error, stator flux linkage error and the stator flux vector angular position are all properly fuzzified into several fuzzy subsets, so that a more suitable space voltage vector can be selected to minimize the torque and flux linkage ripples.

To date, such devices have featured largely in ASIC substitution roles within networked systems; this usage has been highly successful, allowing faster times to market and reduced engineering costs. We argue that there are many additional opportunities for productively using these devices. The requirement is exposure of their high inherent computational concurrency matched by concurrent memory accessibility, their rich on-chip interconnectivity and their complete programmability, at a higher level of abstraction that matches the implementation needs of networked systems. We discuss specific examples supporting this view, and present a highly flexible soft platform architecture at an appropriate level of abstraction from physical devices. This may be viewed as a particularly configurable and programmable type of network processor, offering scope both for innovative networked system implementation and for new directions in networking research. In particular, it is aimed at facilitating scalable solutions, matching differently resourced programmable logic devices to differing performance and sophistication requirements of networked systems, from cheap consumer appliances to high-end network switching.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors, 2004.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9306/29574/01342482.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyper-programmable architectures for adaptable networked systems","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2004.1342482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2004.1342482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1342482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1342482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Hyper-programmable architectures for adaptable networked systems","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8322828","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-29 Sept. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1342482/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyper-programmable architectures for adaptable networked systems","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01342482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032935S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9306","isNumber":"29574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9306","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"29574","articleId":"1342482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1342484,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Many implementations have reported impressive speed-ups, but have typically been point solutions -highly specialized and addressing only one or a few of the many possible options. The problem to be solved is creating a hardware description that implements a broad range of behavioral options without losing efficiency due to feature bloat. We report a set of three component types that address different parts of the DP string matching problem. Multiple, interchangeable implementations are available for each component type. This allows each application to choose the feature set required, then make maximum use of the FPGA fabric according to that application's specific resource requirements. Synthesis estimates show a 4:1 improvement in time-space performance, depending on the options chosen for a specific matching task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Families of FPGA-based algorithms for approximate string matching","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2004.1342484","startPage":"354","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2004.1342484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29574","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors, 2004.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9306/29574/01342484.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1342484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1342484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Families of FPGA-based algorithms for approximate string matching","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1342484/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8322830","conferenceDate":"29-29 Sept. 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Families of FPGA-based algorithms for approximate string matching","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01342484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113674S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9306","isNumber":"29574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9306","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"29574","articleId":"1342484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1342512,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

A mechanism is introduced that determines the QoS of a Web service composition by aggregating the QoS dimensions of the individual services. This allows to verify whether a set of services selected for composition satisfies the QoS requirements for the whole composition. The aggregation performed builds upon abstract composition patterns, which represent basic structural elements of a composition, like sequence, loop, or parallel execution. This work focusses on workflow management environments. We define composition patterns that are derived from Van der Aalst's et al. comprehensive collection of workflow patterns. The resulting aggregation schema supports the same structural elements as found in workflows. Furthermore, the aggregation of several QoS dimensions is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/EDOC.2004.1342512","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

It has been extensively shown that this computational model provides convenient abstractions to reason about and apply program transformations. Nevertheless, the complexity of code generation has long been a deterrent for using polyhedral representation in optimizing compilers. First, code generators have a hard time coping with generated code size and control overhead that may spoil theoretical benefits achieved by the transformations. Second, this step is usually time consuming, hampering the integration of the polyhedral framework in production compilers or feedback-directed, iterative optimization schemes. Moreover, current code generation algorithms only cover a restrictive set of possible transformation functions. This paper discusses a general transformation framework able to deal with nonunimodular, noninvertible, nonintegral or even nonuniform functions. It presents several improvements to a state-of-the-art code generation algorithm. Two directions are explored: generated code size and code generator efficiency. Experimental evidence proves the ability of the improved method to handle real-life problems.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2004.1342537","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 13th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques, 2004.

Prior work in CMP architectures has only studied throughput optimization techniques for a shared cache. The issue of fairness in cache sharing, and its relation to throughput, has not been studied. Fairness is a critical issue because the operating system (OS) thread scheduler's effectiveness depends on the hardware to provide fair cache sharing to co-scheduled threads. Without such hardware, serious problems, such as thread starvation and priority inversion, can arise and render the OS scheduler ineffective. This paper makes several contributions. First, it proposes and evaluates five cache fairness metrics that measure the degree of fairness in cache sharing, and shows that two of them correlate very strongly with the execution-time fairness. Execution-time fairness is defined as how uniform the execution times of co-scheduled threads are changed, where each change is relative to the execution time of the same thread running alone. Secondly, using the metrics, the paper proposes static and dynamic L2 cache partitioning algorithms that optimize fairness. The dynamic partitioning algorithm is easy to implement, requires little or no profiling, has low overhead, and does not restrict the cache replacement algorithm to LRU. The static algorithm, although requiring the cache to maintain LRU stack information, can help the OS thread scheduler to avoid cache thrashing. Finally, this paper studies the relationship between fairness and throughput in detail. We found that optimizing fairness usually increases throughput, while maximizing throughput does not necessarily improve fairness. Using a set of co-scheduled pairs of benchmarks, on average our algorithms improve fairness by a factor of 4/spl times/, while increasing the throughput by 15%, compared to a nonpartitioned shared cache.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1342546/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1342546/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8336847","conferenceDate":"3-3 Oct. 2004","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fair cache sharing and partitioning in a chip multiprocessor architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair cache sharing and partitioning in a chip multiprocessor architecture","confLoc":"Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, France","sourcePdf":"01342546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083956S","chronDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9300","isNumber":"29566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9300","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"29566","articleId":"1342546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1342548,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

The basic prefetch method divides the memory address space into equal-sized concentration zones (CZones), and uses a global history buffer to track and detect patterns in miss address \"deltas\" (differences between consecutive addresses) within each CZone. When simulated with a realistic desktop memory system, CZone prefetching with delta correlations (C/DC) outperforms four other previously proposed prefetching methods. C/DC yields an average performance improvement of 23 percent when compared with no prefetching. Adaptivity is then added to the basic method. A tuning algorithm dynamically configures the CZone size and prefetch degree (i.e. the amount of data pre-fetched) on a per program-phase basis. Adaptive reconfiguration provides additional performance improvements of 4% over C/DC. Overall, the adaptive CZone / delta correlation (AC/DC) method outperforms other methods studied by 10%.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 13th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques, 2004.

The nature of embedded devices not only limits the processing power available to applications, but the limited I/O facilities also considerably hinder development. Several complexities emerge for testing, debugging, quality evaluation and profiling when developing on an embedded device. This means that vision processing algorithms are not only harder to design for embedded systems, but require more time to debug and test than would be the case on a general purpose computing device. However the increase in deployment of robotic systems has seen embedded vision development becoming increasingly necessary in many problem domains. AIBO Vision Workshop 2 (AVW2) is a utility that address these problems associated with vision processing development on embedded systems by providing a flexible, off-line, modularised vision pipeline. That is, AVW2 aids developers in this area as it provides an immersive environment where each step (module) can be flexibly placed in a user configured vision pipeline. The output can then be rigorously inspected and tested. The code of the embedded system is executed in the environment of the AVW2 tool allowing profiling (experimental evaluation of the time requirements of the code).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time embedded vision system development using AIBO Vision Workshop 2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifth Mexican International Conference in Computer Science, 2004.

All EDS take events as input, change their state, and (perhaps) output an event sequence. EDS is typically implemented as a collection of event-handlers designed to respond to individual events. The nature of EDS creates new challenges for test automation. In this paper, we focus on those relevant to automated test oracles. A test oracle is a mechanism that determines whether a software executed correctly for a test case. A test case for an EDS consists of a sequence of events. The test case is executed on the EDS, one event at a time. Errors in the EDS may \"appear\" and later ''disappear\" at several points (e.g., after an event is executed) during test case execution. Because of the behavior of these transient (those that disappear) and persistent (those that don't disappear) errors, EDS require complex and expensive test oracles that compare the expected and actual output multiple times during test case execution. We leverage our previous work to study several applications and observe the occurrence of persistent/transient errors. Our studies show that in practice, a large number of errors in EDS are transient and that there are specific classes of events that lead to transient errors. We use the results of this study to develop a new test oracle that compares the expected and actual output at strategic points during test case execution. We show that the oracle is effective at detecting errors and efficient in terms of resource utilization","doi":"10.1109/ASE.2004.1342736","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 19th International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, 2004.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 19th International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9305/29571/01342736.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE.2004.1342736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1342736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-24 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1342736/","displayDocTitle":"Using transient/persistent errors to develop automated test oracles for event-driven software","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8303495","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1342736/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","conferenceDate":"24-24 Sept. 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using transient/persistent errors to develop automated test oracles for event-driven software","confLoc":"Linz, Austria","sourcePdf":"01342736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07309S","chronDate":"24-24 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9305","isNumber":"29571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9305","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"29571","articleId":"1342736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1342761,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Contemporary ATGs include JTest that does white box testing down to the method level only and black box testing if a specification exists, and AETG that tests pairwise interactions among input variables. The first automatic test generation approaches were static, based on symbolic execution (Clarke, 1976). Korel suggested a dynamic approach to automatic test data generation using function minimization and directed search (Korel, 1990). A dynamic approach can handle array, pointer, function and other dynamic constructs more accurately than a static approach but it may also be more expensive since the program under test is executed repeatedly. Subsequent ATGs explored the use of genetic algorithms (Jones et al., 1996; Michael et al., 2001; Pargas et al., 1999) and simulated annealing (Tracey et al., 1998). These ATGs address the problem of producing test data for low level code coverage like statement, branch and condition/decision and depend on branch function (Korel, 1990) style instrumentation (Jones et al., 1996; Michael et al., 2001) and/or the program graph (Jones et al., 1996; Pargas et al., 1999). Unlike previous work, our ATG, called genet, produces test data for branch coverage with simpler instrumentation than branch functions, does not use program graphs, and is programming language independent, genet uses a genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland, 1975) to search for tests and formal concept analysis (FCA) (Ganter and Wille, 1999) to organize the relationships between tests and their execution traces. The combination of GA with FCA is novel. Further, genet extends the opportunistic approach of GADGET (Michael et al., 2001) by targeting several uncovered branches simultaneously. The relationships that genet learns provides useful insights for test selection, test maintenance and debugging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-24 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1342761/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8303502","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1342761/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","conferenceDate":"24-24 Sept. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using a genetic algorithm and formal concept analysis to generate branch coverage test data automatically","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a genetic algorithm and formal concept analysis to generate branch coverage test data automatically","confLoc":"Linz, Austria","sourcePdf":"01342761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058174S","chronDate":"24-24 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9305","isNumber":"29571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9305","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"29571","articleId":"1342761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1342820,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Chen Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shu-Chen Cheng","id":"37087255659"},{"name":"Yueh-Min Huang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yueh-Min Huang","id":"37087255095"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2209-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"1342820","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1342820","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic scheduling","Genetic algorithms","Optimal scheduling","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","NP-complete problem","Genetic mutations","Gene expression","Hopfield neural networks","Flexible manufacturing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","constraint theory","genetic algorithms","processor scheduling","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic real-time scheduling","multiprocessor tasks","genetic algorithm","job-shop scheduling","NP-complete problems","time complexity","constraint satisfaction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CMPSAC.2004.1342820","pdfPath":"/iel5/9304/29570/01342820.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2004.

The time complexity makes the exhaustive search for a global optimal schedule infeasible or even impossible. Recently, genetic algorithms have shown the feasibility to solve the job-shop scheduling problems. However, a pure GA-based approach tends to generate illegal schedules due to the crossover and the mutation operators. It is often the case that the gene expression or the genetic operators need to be specially tailored to fit the problem domain or some other schemes may be combined to solve the scheduling problems. This work presents a GA-based approach with a feasible energy function to generate good-quality schedules. This work concentrates mainly on dynamic real-time scheduling problems with constraint satisfaction. In our work, we design an easy-understood genotype to generate legal schedules and induce that the proposed approach can converge rapidly to address its applicability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1342820/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8303530","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1342820/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic real-time scheduling for multi-processor tasks using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic real-time scheduling for multi-processor tasks using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"1342820.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068646S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9304","isNumber":"29570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9304","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29570","articleId":"1342820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1342959,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In fact, the vehicle number can't be determined beforehand for practical problems. Because the fixed cost of a vehicle is much more than the running cost, and it is effective to cut down the total cost to seek the minimum number of vehicles in VRPTW. So, both the number and the routes of vehicles should be objectives of the VRPTW, which are described here. This paper presents a mathematical model of vehicle routing problem with time window with uncertain vehicle number. An improved chromosome representation that expresses the various vehicle numbers is proposed on the basis of customers. It is proved by an experiment that the genetic algorithm can search for the optimal solution for both route length and vehicle number.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2004.1343033","startPage":"2846","endPage":"2849 Vol.4","publicationTitle":"Fifth World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (IEEE Cat.

But, for exterior problems with singularity arising from the degenerate boundary (e.g., the edge of parallel-plate capacitor), the dual BEM becomes one of the most efficacious and robust tools for simulating the fringing field near the edge of electron devices because no laborious artificial boundary technique was needed like conventional BEM. After the fringing field is known well, the charge and capacitance of electron devices can be accurately calculated, and we can also understand the minimum allowable data of dielectric strength for keeping off dielectric breakdown. Electrostatics, as used here, involves charges in motion as well as at rest. Generally, there are five fundamental quantities (voltage, charge, current, capacitance, and resistance) in electrostatics that are involved in almost all applications. For most electrical engineers, voltage, or electromotive force (EMF) is the most important one. Electrostatic problems generally play a very important role in improving the performance and reliability of electron devices in the design stage (Cheng, 1989). Although we all understand that the beginning of electrostatic theory is believed to have occurred several centuries before, the first meaningful application, the commercially electrostatic precipitator, was just installed by Cottrell in 1907. Besides two major present technologies from 1907 to now, electrostatic precipitation and electrostatic coating, Castle also suggested that there would be several new industrial applications to come from developments in the fields of micro electromechanical systems (MEMS), biotechnology, ultrafine particles, nanotechnology, and space for the future applications of electrostatics. Because electrostatics still affects the performance of MEMS and electron devices critically nowadays, how to accurately obtain the electric potential V and electric field intensity E becomes especially important for engineers. We all know that scientists and engineers usually use several techniques in solving continuum or field problems. Loosely speaking, these techniques can be classified as experimental, theoretical (or analytical), or numerical.","doi":"10.1109/MCD.2004.1343246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/101/29585/01343246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCD.2004.1343246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29585","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM versus BEM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FEM versus BEM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8147181","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1343246/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM versus BEM","sourcePdf":"01343246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14666S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"101","isNumber":"29585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"101","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"29585","articleId":"1343246","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1343295,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Chen","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Ji Chen","id":"37087147929"},{"name":"Zekui Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Zekui Zhou","id":"37087143334"},{"name":"Xingnin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Xingnin Zhang","id":"37087146754"},{"name":"Tiehao Yu","affiliation":["Design Institute Hangyang Company Limited, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Tiehao Yu","id":"37087144000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8273-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1343295","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Submillimeter wave measurements","Fluid flow measurement","Submillimeter wave technology","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Prototypes","Arithmetic","System performance","Industry applications","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["submillimetre wave imaging","multiphase flow","tomography","flow measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["terahertz process tomography","multiphase flow measurement","X-ray process tomography system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343295","abstract":"Terahertz technology applications, sensors and sources are interesting projects in the academic world now.

The two-dimensional transverse-magnetic grid is comprised entirely of hexagonal cells, except for a small fixed number of pentagonal cells needed for grid completion. Grid-cell areas and locations are optimized to yield a smoothly varying area difference between adjacent cells, thereby maximizing numerical convergence. The new FDTD grid model is considerably superior to our previously reported latitude-longitude grid because it is simpler to construct, avoids geometrical singularities at the poles, executes about 14 times faster, provides much more isotropic wave propagation, and permits an easier interchange of data with state-of-the-art Earth-simulation codes used by the geophysics community. We verify our new model by conducting numerical studies of impulsive antipodal propagation and the Schumann resonance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/28658/01343324.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2004.834936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2004.834936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=28658","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient modeling of impulsive ELF antipodal propagation about the Earth sphere using an optimized two-dimensional geodesic FDTD grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Geophysical measurement techniques","Earth","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic propagation","Electromagnetic modeling","Frequency","Convergence of numerical methods","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","Earth","radiowave propagation","differential geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive ELF antipodal propagation","Earth sphere","two-dimensional geodesic FDTD grid","geodesic finite-difference time-domain grid","extremely low frequency electromagnetic wave propagation","two-dimensional transverse-magnetic grid","hexagonal cells","pentagonal cells","numerical convergence","isotropic wave propagation","Earth-simulation codes","Schumann resonance","3 Hz to 3 kHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2004","displayDocTitle":"Efficient modeling of impulsive ELF antipodal propagation about the Earth sphere using an optimized two-dimensional geodesic FDTD grid","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1343324/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8240155","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient modeling of impulsive ELF antipodal propagation about the Earth sphere using an optimized two-dimensional geodesic FDTD grid","sourcePdf":"01343324.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096736S","chronDate":"2004","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"28658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"28658","articleId":"1343324","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":1343325,"authors":[{"name":"Ziri-Castro","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"lastName":"Ziri-Castro","id":"37087311615"},{"name":"Scanlon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"lastName":"Scanlon","id":"37087311652"},{"name":"Evans","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulster, Newtownabbey, UK"],"lastName":"Evans","id":"37087311163"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"1343325","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indoor radio communication","Receivers","Wireless LAN","Time measurement","Narrowband","Radio transmitters","Indoor environments","Ray tracing","Rayleigh channels","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","microwave receivers","mobile radio","wireless LAN","ray tracing","fading channels","microwave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio channel characterization","microwave bodyworn receiver","wireless local area networks","handportable terminals","narrowband radio channel","fixed transmitter","mobile bodyworn receiver","site-specific ray-tracing simulation","receiver radiation pattern","body-shadowing effect","small-scale fading statistics","Rayleigh distributions","lognormal distributions","line-of-sight conditions","nonline-of-sight conditions","bodyworn antennas","FDTD","radio propagation","5.2 GHz","18 m","5.4 dB","15.7 dB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343325","abstract":"Wireless local area network applications may include the use of bodyworn or handportable terminals.

This is accomplished by learning a set of visual landmarks such as the goals and the corner posts. Due to the dynamic changing environment and the partial observable of the landmarks, four localization cases are discussed in order to get robust localization performance. Localization is performed using a method that matches the observed landmarks, i.e. color blobs which are extracted from the environment. The advantages of the cylindrical projection are discussed especially considering the characteristic of the visual landmark and the meaning of the blob extraction.

The classical formulation is given in the spatial domain, the motor of the procedure is a second-order linear system, and rigidity and elasticity are the basic parameters for its characterization. This paper proposes a novel formulation based on a frequency-domain analysis: the internal energy functional and the Lagrange minimization are performed entirely in the frequency domain, which leads to a simple formulation and design. The frequency-based implementation offers important computational savings in comparison to the original one, a feature that is improved by the efficient hardware and software computation of the FFT algorithm. This new formulation focuses on the stiffness spectrum, allowing the possibility of constructing deformable models apart from the elasticity and rigidity-based original formulation. Simulation examples validate the theoretical results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Deformable models","Elasticity","Computer vision","Computer graphics","Linear systems","Lagrangian functions","Hardware","Software algorithms","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","computer graphics","linear systems","frequency-domain analysis","minimisation","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain analysis","active parametric deformable models","computer vision","computer graphics","mimic real physical systems","spatial domain analysis","second order linear system","internal energy function","Lagrange minimization","hardware computation","software computation","FFT algorithm","stiffness spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Active deformable models","snakes","frequency domain","Fast Fourier transform."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2004.124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/29588/01343844.pdf","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2004.124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency domain formulation of active parametric deformable models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency domain formulation of active parametric deformable models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343844/","volume":"26","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1343844/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8217008","pubMedId":"15573818","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency domain formulation of active parametric deformable models","sourcePdf":"01343844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06176S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"29588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"29588","articleId":"1343844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1343862,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

The residues obtained from a fixed number of bits are again divided into spread code index and data symbol for modulation. The modulated data symbol is spread using the indexed orthogonal codes and transmitted through a communication channel. The proposed system uses a lower number of orthogonal codes than conventional RNS-based CDMA and the performance is comparable. The computational complexity of the proposed system is compared against alternative schemes such as M-ary CDMA and conventional RNS-based CDMA.

We find that the maximum-likelihood detector that optimally compensates for the time-varying channel is very tolerant to time-varying fading, attaining full diversity order even for the extreme case of /spl rho/=0.

In this letter, a metric for detection of these patterns is derived. It is assumed that the distribution of the synchronization patterns in the symbol stream is known. By taking advantage of this knowledge, improved synchronization can be realized over traditional correlation with correction. Transmission using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) on an additive white Gaussian noise channel is considered first. This derivation is then extended to higher-order modulation schemes, and high-signal-to-noise ratio approximations to the exact metrics are derived. Experimental results for BPSK and quarternary phase shift keying signaling are shown. Finally, the effects of inexact knowledge of the channel and a priori probabilities are examined, and it is shown that the aperiodic metric is not sensitive to small deviations in the estimates of the channel or the synchronization pattern probabilities.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833416","startPage":"1386","endPage":"1392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343866.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of aperiodically embedded synchronization patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Detection of aperiodically embedded synchronization patterns","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1343866/","accessionNumber":"8155756","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343866/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of aperiodically embedded synchronization patterns","sourcePdf":"01343866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061354S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1343867,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Chul Hong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Chul Hong","id":"37278991500"},{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Jinho Choi","id":"37280083000"},{"name":"Young-Ho Jung","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Ho Jung","id":"37274422500"},{"name":"Seong Rag Kim","affiliation":["Mobile Telecommunication Research Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong Rag Kim","id":"37279276800"},{"name":"Y.H.

In this letter, we present an exact average symbol error rate analysis for the distributed spatial diversity wireless system with K amplifying relays in a Rayleigh-fading environment. The average symbol error rate formula allows us to clearly illustrate the advantage that the distributed diversity system has in overcoming the severe penalty in signal-to-noise ratio caused by Rayleigh fading. Using simple bounds on the probability of error, we show that the cooperative network presented in this letter achieves full diversity order.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833431","startPage":"1416","endPage":"1421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343871.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact symbol error probability of a Cooperative network in a Rayleigh-fading environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Exact symbol error probability of a Cooperative network in a Rayleigh-fading environment","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8155761","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1343871/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact symbol error probability of a Cooperative network in a Rayleigh-fading environment","sourcePdf":"01343871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071779S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"714","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1343872,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The decision is based on information that the basestation receives about the time-varying channels between itself and the mobiles. We focus on deciding whether or not Proportional Fair is stable in a situation with finite queues and a data arrival process. That is, we wish to decide if Proportional Fair keeps all queues bounded whenever this is feasible.

It is based on the diversity gain obtained through the ordering and selection of the more reliable subcarriers. Higher order modulations are used to compensate for the reduced subcarrier utilization. On the contrary to other bit-loading algorithms, it does not require nonuniform bit and power level allocation among subcarriers, thus drastically reducing the modem hardware complexity and making it attractive as a possible extension of existing high-speed wireless local-area network standards. System performance is analyzed in different configurations and conditions, including a realistic 5-GHz propagation scenario. Comparison with optimal adapted and unadapted solutions is also made. Finally, the effect of unideal feedback of the channel state information is analyzed showing the robustness and the low overhead required of the new scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ordered subcarrier selection algorithm for OFDM-based high-speed WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ordered subcarrier selection algorithm for OFDM-based high-speed WLANs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155767","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1343877/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordered subcarrier selection algorithm for OFDM-based high-speed WLANs","sourcePdf":"01343877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067048S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1343884,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Furthermore, rapid channel fluctuations degrade the performance of feedback schemes that would otherwise increase the information throughput that may be achieved. These impediments either reduce achievable capacity or impose an effective \"speed limit\" on the mobile, above which the effective throughput is reduced. In this paper, the signal incident at the mobile is represented as a sum of plane waves. The channel transfer matrix is found to factor into time-dependent and time-independent parts. A processing method is proposed whereby the received signals are first preprocessed so as to produce signals that fluctuate on a much slower time scale. The preprocessing consists of beam forming, followed by Doppler compensation for signals received on each beam. Both operations are nonsingular and do not alter the capacity of the MIMO channel. Beam forming effectively partitions the angular spectrum at the mobile, with each partition suffering a smaller Doppler spread, resulting in a \"slowed down\" channel fluctuation due to mobile motion. The coherence time of the preprocessed channel is found to increase by a factor on the order of the number of mobile receive antennas. In the limit of an infinite number of mobile receive antennas, the MIMO channel is shown to become static. These results remove constraints imposed by training requirements on the number of transmit antennas and increase allowed vehicle speeds. The \"slowed down\" channel characteristics may also be fed back to the transmitter, allowing an increase in information throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343892.pdf","startPage":"1554","endPage":"1565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slowing the time-fluctuating MIMO channel by beam forming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Slowing the time-fluctuating MIMO channel by beam forming","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155782","htmlLink":"/document/1343892/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slowing the time-fluctuating MIMO channel by beam forming","sourcePdf":"01343892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087786S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1343893,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343893/1343893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Jun Zhang (S'02) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2000.

Taking a holistic approach, we investigate the throughput of a CDMA network employing linear multiuser detection, type-I automatic retransmission request (ARQ), and packet combining. In particular, the following two models of CDMA data networks are considered. 1) Fixed-access CDMA data networks, by which we mean that the number of active users is fixed. The corresponding throughput is analyzed by using a one-dimensional Markov chain, and conditions for achieving the optimal throughput are explored. 2) Random-access CDMA data networks, in which we take into account the random arrivals/departures of users. By viewing the fixed-access network studied in the first case as a snapshot of the random-access network, we exploit the results therein to analyze the random-access network, under a processor-sharing system model. Moreover, we identify some important properties of the corresponding throughput and devise a simple recursive algorithm to find the throughput-optimal admission region. Some recent advances on large-system performance of various multiuser detection algorithms are employed in our study. The results in this paper quantitatively characterize the potential for network throughput gain by employing multiuser detection and packet combining, in both fixed-access and random-access CDMA packet data networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.0042.833498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343894.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.0042.833498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput of CDMA data networks with multiuser detection, ARQ, and packet combining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343894/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput of CDMA data networks with multiuser detection, ARQ, and packet combining","volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155784","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1343894/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput of CDMA data networks with multiuser detection, ARQ, and packet combining","sourcePdf":"01343894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187899S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1343895,"authors":[{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343895/1343895-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong In Kim (S'89\u2013M'91\u2013SM'02) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1980 and 1984, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, in 1987 and 1990, respectively.","From 1984 to 1985, he was with the Korea Telecom Research Center, Seoul, as a Researcher.

Based on a general downlink SIR model, the problem of optimal dynamic rate and power adaptation under multiple SIR constraints is also formulated, for which the rate and power allocation can be found by an exhaustive search. Two schemes, namely, near-optimal and suboptimal schemes, are proposed for implementation-friendly dynamic rate and power adaptation. Performance of dynamic joint rate and power adaptation under the proposed framework is evaluated under random micro-mobility model with uncorrelated long-term fading and a directional micro-mobility model with correlated long-term fading in a cellular WCDMA environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic rate and power adaptation for provisioning class-based QoS in Cellular Multirate WCDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343895.pdf","startPage":"1590","endPage":"1601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic rate and power adaptation for provisioning class-based QoS in Cellular Multirate WCDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343895/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155785","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic rate and power adaptation for provisioning class-based QoS in Cellular Multirate WCDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01343895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086752S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1343896,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

This paper provides a comprehensive investigation of the performance and practical implementation issues of open-loop transmit diversity schemes for the IS-2000 third-generation cellular CDMA standard. Discussed in detail are orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD) and space-time spreading (STS) diversity schemes. STS is a TD technique that is motivated by space-time coding principles originally described for narrowband systems. OTD is a TD technique that obtains diversity not at the symbol level, but in the decoding process, and has performance that is in general lower bounded by STS, which obtains diversity combining prior to decoding. Thus, STS always outperforms OTD, with the improvement particularly significant in the presence of weak convolutional codes. Probability of error analysis is performed for STS under the assumptions of imperfect channel estimates, correlation between antennas, and unequal pilot power allocations. Extensions to STS are provided for the multicarrier version of the standard and four transmit antennas. Simulation studies are performed to detail the performance of both open-loop TD schemes with convolutional coding and closed-loop power control consistent with the 3GPP2/IS-2000 standard. Many of these results were generated in the course of the IS-2000 standardization procedure. Performance is studied in radio environments which experience flat Rayleigh fading, frequency selective Rayleigh fading, spatially selective fading, as well as Ricean fading with various K factors. Some additional results are presented for cases where mobile receivers have two receive antennas. Implementation issues are also considered including the impact of antenna delay differences on performance, transmitter and receiver architectures, and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343896.pdf","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of open-loop transmit diversity techniques for IS-2000 systems: a comparative study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343896/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of open-loop transmit diversity techniques for IS-2000 systems: a comparative study","volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155786","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1343896/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of open-loop transmit diversity techniques for IS-2000 systems: a comparative study","sourcePdf":"01343896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084544S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1343897,"authors":[{"name":"Seokhyun Yoon","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343897/1343897-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seokhyun Yoon (S'95\u2013M'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 1992 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, in 2003.","In 1999, he was a Senior Technical Staff Member with the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Deajeon, Korea, where he worked on OFDM and digital audio broadcasting systems.

The system under consideration can be regarded as an enhanced version of the classical CDMA packet radio network. When applying a hybrid type-II ARQ, the probability of packet success and packet length is generally different from attempt to attempt. Since the conventional analytical model, customarily employed for the ALOHA system with pure or hybrid type-I ARQ, cannot be applied for this case, we introduce an expanded analytical model, which can be regarded as a network of queues, and apply Jackson and Burke's theorems to simplify the analysis. When using code combining, soft-decision decoding is usually considered, in which case, it is very difficult to find the actual probability of packet success, especially when the number of terminals changes during a packet time duration. Hence, instead of finding the actual probability of packet success, we evaluate a lower and an upper bound. Together with the expanded model and the packet success probability bound, we obtain the corresponding throughput bounds by iteratively searching the steady-state arrival rate, /spl lambda/, and the average departure rate, /spl mu/, for given composite offered traffic, G=/spl lambda///spl mu/. The results show that significant improvement in throughput can be achieved by exploiting high coding gain of turbo codes and channel utilization efficiency of incremental redundancy retransmission protocol.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet data communications over coded CDMA - Part II: Throughput bound of CDMA unslotted ALOHA with hybrid type II ARQ using rate compatible punctured turbo codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833412","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343897.pdf","startPage":"1616","endPage":"1625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Packet data communications over coded CDMA - Part II: Throughput bound of CDMA unslotted ALOHA with hybrid type II ARQ using rate compatible punctured turbo codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343897/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155787","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet data communications over coded CDMA - Part II: Throughput bound of CDMA unslotted ALOHA with hybrid type II ARQ using rate compatible punctured turbo codes","sourcePdf":"01343897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060984S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1343898,"authors":[{"name":"Shengli Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343898/1343898-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shengli Zhou (M'03) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2002.","He has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 2003.

The new discrete-time MIMO channel model includes the combined effects of the transmit filter, physical MIMO multipath channel fading, and receive filter, and it has the same sampling period as that of the MIMO receiver. This leads to very efficient simulation of physical continuous-time MIMO channels. A new method is also presented to efficiently generate the MIMO channel stochastic coefficients. The statistical accuracy of the discrete-time MIMO channel model is rigorously verified through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations in different conditions. The high computational efficiency of the discrete-time MIMO channel model is illustrated by comparing it to that of the continuous-time MIMO channel model. The new model is further employed to evaluate the channel capacity of MIMO systems in a triply selective Rayleigh fading environment. The simulation results reveal some interesting effects of spatial correlations, multipaths, and number of antennas on the MIMO channel capacity.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1678","endPage":"1688","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833444","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343903.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrete-time model for triply selective MIMO Rayleigh fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343903/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"A discrete-time model for triply selective MIMO Rayleigh fading channels","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155793","volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343903/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discrete-time model for triply selective MIMO Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"01343903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082321S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1343904,"authors":[{"name":"Wensheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343904/1343904-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wensheng Zhang (S'00) received the B.S. degree from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 1997 and the M.S. degree in computer science and engineering from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in 2000.

We introduce the concept of dynamic convoy tree-based collaboration, and formalize it as a multiple objective optimization problem which needs to find a convoy tree sequence with high tree coverage and low energy consumption. We propose an optimal solution which achieves 100% coverage and minimizes the energy consumption under certain ideal situations. Considering the real constraints of a sensor network, we propose several practical implementations: the conservative scheme and the prediction-based scheme for tree expansion and pruning; the sequential and the localized reconfiguration schemes for tree reconfiguration. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the practical implementations and the optimal solution. The results show that the prediction-based scheme outperforms the conservative scheme and it can achieve similar coverage and energy consumption to the optimal solution. The experiments also show that the localized reconfiguration scheme outperforms the sequential reconfiguration scheme when the node density is high, and the trend is reversed when the node density is low.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833443","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343904.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCTC: dynamic convoy tree-based collaboration for target tracking in sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343904/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DCTC: dynamic convoy tree-based collaboration for target tracking in sensor networks","volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343904/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8155794","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCTC: dynamic convoy tree-based collaboration for target tracking in sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01343904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057139S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"337","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1343908,"authors":[{"name":"Guosen Yue","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA","NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343908/1343908-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guosen Yue received the B.S. degree in physics and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2004.","Since August 2004, he has been with NEC Laboratories American, Princeton, NJ, conducting research on broadband wireless systems and mobile networks.

In particular, we assume the users employing the capacity-achieving low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and at the receiver, turbo multiuser detection is used to implement joint decoding. We solve the coding-spreading optimization based on the extrinsic information signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) evolution curves for the soft-input soft-output (SISO) multiuser detectors and the SISO LDPC decoders. Two types of SISO multiuser detectors are treated, namely, the soft interference cancellation minimum mean-square-error (SIC-MMSE) detector and the soft interference cancellation matched filter (SIC-MF) detector. Moreover, both single-cell and multicell scenarios are considered. For each of these cases, we are able to characterize the extrinsic information SNR analytically, for both finite-size systems and for the so-called large systems where asymptotic performance results must be evoked. Our analysis indicates that the SIC-MMSE-based system offers a significant gain in spectral efficiency compared with the SIC-MF counterpart, in both single-cell and multicell scenarios. This is in contrast to the single-user decoding case, where it has been shown that the MMSE detector offers little advantage over the conventional matched-filter in terms of capacity in multicell scenario. Moreover, the results on coding-spreading tradeoff for finite-size systems and large systems match very well.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343908.pdf","startPage":"1734","endPage":"1745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding-spreading tradeoff in LDPC-coded CDMA with turbo multiuser detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Coding-spreading tradeoff in LDPC-coded CDMA with turbo multiuser detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343908/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8155798","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1343908/","volume":"3","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding-spreading tradeoff in LDPC-coded CDMA with turbo multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"01343908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06006S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1343909,"authors":[{"name":"Qingwen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343909/1343909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qingwen Liu (S'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2001.

Diminishing returns on spectral efficiency, that result when increasing the maximum number of retransmissions, suggest that a small number of retransmissions offers a desirable delay-throughput tradeoff, in practice.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833474","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343909.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer combining of adaptive Modulation and coding with truncated ARQ over wireless links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer combining of adaptive Modulation and coding with truncated ARQ over wireless links","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8155799","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1343909/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer combining of adaptive Modulation and coding with truncated ARQ over wireless links","sourcePdf":"01343909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082462S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"687","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1343910,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343910/1343910-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Tan (S'99\u2013M'04) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, in 1988 and 1991, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2003.","From 1991 to 1996, he was a Lecturer and an Assistant Professor in computer engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

We consider Alamouti's ST coding scheme for two transmit antennas designed for flat-fading channels but allow the channel to be frequency selective. A (spreading) code-constrained inverse filter criterion (IFC)-based linear blind detector to detect a desired user's signal for uncoded CDMA signals exploiting only a single transmit and single receive antenna was recently presented. The IFC method exploits the higher order statistics of the data. In ST-coded multiantenna CDMA systems, a user signal may be treated as the superposition of several virtual user signals derived from the same parent user. In particular, for Alamouti's scheme, one has two virtual users for each user if the information symbols are real valued. The previously proposed code-constrained IFC-based detector is modified to detect a given virtual-user signal. The original user signal can then be recovered from the associated detected virtual user signals obtained by running two code-constrained IFC-based detectors in parallel. We also propose a novel approach combining the code-constrained IFC and a penalty function to simultaneously extract the two virtual user signals associated with a given user. Global minima of the proposed cost functions are analyzed. An illustrative simulation example is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343912.pdf","startPage":"1770","endPage":"1780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.833464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind multiuser receiver for space-time coded CDMA signals in frequency-selective channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Frequency","Detectors","Receiving antennas","Block codes","Transmitting antennas","Nonlinear filters","Higher order statistics","Signal detection","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio receivers","space-time codes","block codes","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","antenna arrays","fading channels","channel coding","higher order statistics","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind multiuser receiver","space-time coded CDMA signal","frequency-selective channels","DS-CDMA","direct sequence code division multiple access","multiple transmit antennas","multiple receive antennas","space-time block coding","Alamouti ST coding","flat-fading channel","code-constrained inverse filter criterion","linear blind detector","users signal detection","higher order statistics","virtual users signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Blind multiuser receiver for space-time coded CDMA signals in frequency-selective channels","volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343912/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155802","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind multiuser receiver for space-time coded CDMA signals in frequency-selective channels","sourcePdf":"01343912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088573S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1343913,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

In an uplink power control scenario, the proposed scheme performs uplink prediction using downlink-derived (linear) predictor coefficients. Essentially, the lack of correlation between the fading processes on uplink and downlink (due to FDD and frequency selective fading) is circumvented by using the uplink fading history, together with a set of link-independent, autoregressive (AR) coefficients. An AR model is used to formally describe the frequency selective fading process on either link, regardless of the number of Rayleigh paths. It is also proven that the relevant AR coefficients are common to both links, up to a proper normalization, irrespective of whether the number of paths on the uplink differs from that on the downlink. Both an uncoded and a coded system are simulated, and their performance results are compared, on equal grounds, with those of the corresponding nonpredictive systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictability of uplink channels from downlink channels in frequency division duplex systems: a power control application","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.834689","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343913.pdf","startPage":"1781","endPage":"1788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.834689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Predictability of uplink channels from downlink channels in frequency division duplex systems: a power control application","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343913/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155803","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictability of uplink channels from downlink channels in frequency division duplex systems: a power control application","sourcePdf":"01343913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06022S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1343914,"authors":[{"name":"Wha Sook Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343914/1343914-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wha Sook Jeon (M'90\u2013SM'01) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1983, 1985, and 1989, respectively.","From 1989 to 1999, she was with the Department of Computer Engineering, Hansung University, Korea.

In order to provide effectively the packet data service with scarce radio resource, several systems, including the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) enhancement of wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA), have been proposed. In this paper, we design an Internet Protocol (IP) packet scheduler for high-speed packet data services using the wireless packet access system. We design the scheduler so that its performance is maximized from the standpoint of end-to-end application level rather than from the standpoint of radio interface.

The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by extensive simulation and compared with the performances of the existing three schedulers. The results show that the proposed scheduler has remarkably better performance than the baseline schedulers for performance comparison.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet scheduler for mobile Internet services using high speed downlink packet access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.834698","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343914.pdf","startPage":"1789","endPage":"1801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.834698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Packet scheduler for mobile Internet services using high speed downlink packet access","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343914/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155804","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet scheduler for mobile Internet services using high speed downlink packet access","sourcePdf":"01343914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076122S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1343915,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Hui Tan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering,IVF, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Peng Hui Tan (S'00) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 1998 and 1999, respectively.

The intelligent call admission controller (ICAC) contains a fuzzy call admission processor to make admission decision for a call request by considering QoS measures such as the forced termination (drop call) probability of handoff, the outage probability of all service types, the predicted next-step existing-call interference, the link gain, and the estimated equivalent interference of the call request. The pipeline recurrent neural network (PRNN) is used to accurately predict the next-step existing-call interference, and the fuzzy logic theory is applied to estimate the new/handoff call interference based on knowledge of effective bandwidth method. Simulation results indicate that ICAC achieves system capacity higher than conventional CAC schemes by an amount of more than 10% in both low and high moving speed cases. Moreover, ICAC can cope with the unpredictable statistical fluctuation of wireless multimedia traffic; it always fulfill QoS requirements for all service types and keep the forced termination probability satisfied, while the CAC of multimedia calls (MCAC) and SIR-based CAC with intercell interference prediction (PSIR-CAC) fail to adapt to the variation of traffic conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent call admission control for wideband CDMA cellular systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.834702","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343916.pdf","startPage":"1810","endPage":"1821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.834702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343916/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent call admission control for wideband CDMA cellular systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343916/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155806","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent call admission control for wideband CDMA cellular systems","sourcePdf":"01343916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107406S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1343917,"authors":[{"name":"Bore-Kuen Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/29589/1343917/1343917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bore-Kuen Lee (S'87-M'91) was born in Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1961.

The novel approach we take is to discretize the search space and apply integer-programming techniques. We assume that mobile terminal has n/sub T/ transmit antennas while the base station has n/sub R/ receive antennas. With multiple antennas at the transmitter and the receiver, joint beam-forming has to be considered. In order that our proposed framework is practicable and can be implemented with a reasonable cost in a real environment, we impose a linear spatial processing constraint at the physical layer of the base station. We apply the framework to two commonly used system utility functions, namely, maximal throughput and proportional fair. We devise an optimal scheduling algorithm based on our framework as a performance reference and observe that transmit antennas and receive antennas have different roles in the system performance. On the other hand, we study how far we are from the optimal performance on a widely used heuristic called the greedy algorithm in 3G1x and Universal Mobile Terrestrial Service (UMTS) systems. We found that it is optimal when n/sub R/=1 but there is quite a large performance penalty when n/sub R/>1 compared with the optimal reference. We further propose another heuristic algorithm [called the genetic algorithm(GA)] and found that the GA is quite promising in terms of performance complexity tradeoff, especially for large K (number of mobile users), n/sub T/, and n/sub R/.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/29589/01343918.pdf","startPage":"1832","endPage":"1843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2004.834684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.834684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical framework for multiuser uplink MIMO space-time scheduling design with convex utility functions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Optimal scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis","Scheduling algorithm","Base stations","Mobile antennas","Transmitters","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio links","scheduling","MIMO systems","integer programming","mobile radio","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","radio transmitters","radio receivers","antenna arrays","3G mobile communication","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser uplink MIMO space-time scheduling","convex utility functions","multiple input multiple output algorithm","integer-programming technique","mobile terminal","transmit antennas","base station","receive antennas","multiple antennas","transmitter","receiver","joint beam-forming","linear spatial processing constraint","maximal throughput","proportional fair","optimal scheduling algorithm","greedy algorithm","Universal Mobile Terrestrial Service","UMTS","genetic algorithm","mobile user"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Analytical framework for multiuser uplink MIMO space-time scheduling design with convex utility functions","volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1343918/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155808","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical framework for multiuser uplink MIMO space-time scheduling design with convex utility functions","sourcePdf":"01343918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093817S","chronDate":"Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"29589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"29589","articleId":"1343918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1343929,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The modulation and coding schemes, numbers of multicodes, and transmit powers used for all mobile stations (MS) are jointly chosen so as to maximize the total transmission bit rate, subject to certain constraints. Based on the discrete and nonlinear nature of the proposed model, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problem is formulated. It is shown that the optimal allocation generally involves simultaneous transmissions to several MS. A scheduler which uses knowledge of MS traffic loads is also proposed and shown to yield a significant improvement in throughput.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2004.835348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/29590/01343930.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2004.835348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink scheduling optimization in CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1343930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343930/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink scheduling optimization in CDMA networks","volume":"8","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8207972","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1343930/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink scheduling optimization in CDMA networks","sourcePdf":"01343930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039729S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"29590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"29590","articleId":"1343930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1343934,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To date, a record 3-dB bandwidth of 310 GHz and a millimeter-wave output power of over 20 mW at 100 GHz have been achieved. The superior capability of the UTC-PD for generating very large high-bit-rate electrical signals as well as a very high RF output power in millimeter/submillimeter ranges can lead to innovations in various systems, such as broadband optical communications systems, wireless communications systems, and high-frequency measurement systems. Accomplishments include photoreceivers of up to 160 Gb/s, error-free DEMUX operations using an integrated UTC-PD driven optical gate of up to 320 Gb/s, a 10-Gb/s millimeter-wave wireless link at 120 GHz, submillimeter-wave generation at frequencies of up to 1.5 THz, and photonic frequency conversion with an efficiency of -8 dB at 60 GHz. For the practical use, various types of modules, such as a 1-mm coaxial connector module, a rectangular-waveguide output module, and a quasi-optic module, have been developed.

We have developed a compact (82/spl times/60/spl times/30 mm) and versatile single-photon timing module (SPTM), based on a planar epitaxial single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) working with a monolithic integrated active quenching and active reset circuit (i-AQC) and cooled by a Peltier element. The main operating parameters are computer controlled via RS-232 interface and the photon counting rate can be continuously monitored. The photon detection efficiency is 45% at 500 nm with cooling at -15/spl deg/C, the dark counting rate is 5 c/s with SPAD operating at 5 V excess bias voltage, 10c/s operating at 10 V. The time resolution obtained with tightly focused illumination has 60-ps full-width at half-maximum. Comparative tests with the SPTM prototype and with an advanced commercially available photon counting module confirmed that the time resolution and sensitivity of the SPTM make it possible to resolve and measure even short lifetime components of a single molecule. The SPTM thus made possible experiments leading to a deeper insight into angstrom-scale structural changes of single-protein molecules.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2004.833975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/29591/01343965.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2004.833975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photon-timing detector module for single-molecule spectroscopy with 60-ps resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1343965/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Photon-timing detector module for single-molecule spectroscopy with 60-ps resolution","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2004","accessionNumber":"8163049","htmlLink":"/document/1343965/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photon-timing detector module for single-molecule spectroscopy with 60-ps resolution","sourcePdf":"01343965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089099S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"29591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"29591","articleId":"1343965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":1343966,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique can improve the PAPR statistics of OFDM signals. In the PTS technique, the data block to be transmitted is partitioned into disjoint subblocks and the subblocks are combined using phase factors to minimize PAPR. As ordinary PTS technique requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of allowed phase factors, the search complexity increases exponentially with the number of subblocks. In the proposed technique, a gradient descent search is performed to find the phase factors.

We study how to optimize throughput of large transfers across richly connected, adaptive overlay networks, focusing on the potential of collaborative transfers between peers to supplement ongoing downloads. First, we make the case for an erasure-resilient encoding of the content. Using the digital fountain encoding approach, end hosts can efficiently reconstruct the original content of size n from a subset of any n symbols drawn from a large universe of encoding symbols. Such an approach affords reliability and a substantial degree of application-level flexibility, as it seamlessly accommodates connection migration and parallel transfers while providing resilience to packet loss. However, since the sets of encoding symbols acquired by peers during downloads may overlap substantially, care must be taken to enable them to collaborate effectively. Our main contribution is a collection of useful algorithmic tools for efficient summarization and approximate reconciliation of sets of symbols between pairs of collaborating peers, all of which keep message complexity and computation to a minimum. Through simulations and experiments on a prototype implementation, we demonstrate the performance benefits of our informed content-delivery mechanisms and how they complement existing overlay network architectures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informed content delivery across adaptive overlay networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2004.836103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/29593/01344002.pdf","startPage":"767","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2004.836103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Informed content delivery across adaptive overlay networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1344002/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8158112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informed content delivery across adaptive overlay networks","sourcePdf":"01344002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098007S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"29593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"29593","articleId":"1344002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1344005,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We show that fault localization through iterative belief updating is resilient to noise in the observed symptoms and prove that Bayesian reasoning can now be used in practice to provide effective fault localization.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2004.836121","startPage":"809","endPage":"822","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/29593/01344005.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2004.836121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic fault localization in communication systems using belief networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Bayesian methods","Fault diagnosis","Protocols","Fault detection","Availability","Nonhomogeneous media","Shape","Discrete event simulation","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","fault location","belief networks","iterative methods","computational complexity","inference mechanisms","telecommunication network management","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic fault location","complex communication systems","belief networks","Bayesian reasoning techniques","polytrees","iterative belief updating","exponential complexity","probabilistic inference","root cause diagnostics","bucket elimination algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344005/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic fault localization in communication systems using belief networks","volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1344005/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8158115","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic fault localization in communication systems using belief networks","sourcePdf":"01344005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103379S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"29593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"29593","articleId":"1344005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1344008,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We show that these four concepts, namely 1) nonlinear definition of the path length; 2) a /spl kappa/-shortest path approach; 3) nondominance; and 4) look-ahead, are fundamental building blocks of a multiconstrained routing algorithm. The main reasons to consider exact multiconstrained routing algorithms are as follows. First, the NP-complete behavior seems only to occur in specially constructed graphs, which are unlikely to occur in realistic communication networks. Second, there exist exact algorithms that are equally complex as heuristics in algorithmic structure and in running time on topologies that do not induce NP-complete behavior. Third, by simply restricting the number /spl kappa/ of paths explored during the path computation, the computational complexity can be decreased at the expense of possibly loosing exactness. The presented four concepts are incorporated in SAMCRA, a self-adaptive multiple constraints routing algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8158118","htmlLink":"/document/1344008/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Concepts of exact QoS routing algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concepts of exact QoS routing algorithms","sourcePdf":"01344008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140655S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"29593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"29593","articleId":"1344008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1344012,"authors":[{"name":"I.C.

Among microphone array structures the recently proposed general transfer function generalized sidelobe canceller (TF-GSC) has shown impressive noise reduction abilities in a directional noise field, while still maintaining low speech distortion. However, in a diffused noise field less significant noise reduction is obtainable. The performance is even further degraded when the noise signal is nonstationary. In this contribution we propose three postfiltering methods for improving the performance of microphone arrays. Two of which are based on single-channel speech enhancers and making use of recently proposed algorithms concatenated to the beamformer output. The third is a multichannel speech enhancer which exploits noise-only components constructed within the TF-GSC structure. This work concentrates on the assessment of the proposed postfiltering structures. An extensive experimental study, which consists of both objective and subjective evaluation in various noise fields, demonstrates the advantage of the multichannel postfiltering compared to the single-channel techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344023/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8158128","volume":"12","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement based on the general transfer function GSC and postfiltering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement based on the general transfer function GSC and postfiltering","sourcePdf":"01344023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061668S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"89","isNumber":"29594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"29594","articleId":"1344023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344034,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Il Park","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/29595/1344034/1344034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sang-Il Park was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1967.

A Bayesian framework that incorporates spectral, spatial, and temporal features to characterize the background appearance is proposed. Under this framework, the background is represented by the most significant and frequent features, i.e., the principal features , at each pixel. A Bayes decision rule is derived for background and foreground classification based on the statistics of principal features. Principal feature representation for both the static and dynamic background pixels is investigated. A novel learning method is proposed to adapt to both gradual and sudden \"once-off\" background changes. The convergence of the learning process is analyzed and a formula to select a proper learning rate is derived. Under the proposed framework, a novel algorithm for detecting foreground objects from complex environments is then established. It consists of change detection, change classification, foreground segmentation, and background maintenance. Experiments were conducted on image sequences containing targets of interest in a variety of environments, e.g., offices, public buildings, subway stations, campuses, parking lots, airports, and sidewalks. Good results of foreground detection were obtained. Quantitative evaluation and comparison with the existing method show that the proposed method provides much improved results.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344037","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Image sequences","Feature extraction","Motion analysis","Computer vision","Layout","Pixel","Bayesian methods","Statistics","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","Bayes methods","image sequences","feature extraction","image segmentation","image classification","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical modeling","foreground object detection","Bayesian framework","Bayes decision rule","principal feature representation","learning method","complex background","change detection","change classification","foreground segmentation","background maintenance","image sequence","spectral features","spatial features","temporal features"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Cluster Analysis","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Subtraction Technique"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/29595/01344037.pdf","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2004.836169","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2004.836169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical modeling of complex backgrounds for foreground object detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344037/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical modeling of complex backgrounds for foreground object detection","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157519","pubMedId":"15540455","htmlLink":"/document/1344037/","volume":"13","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical modeling of complex backgrounds for foreground object detection","sourcePdf":"01344037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086026S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"29595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"677","xplore-issue":"29595","articleId":"1344037","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344038,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This method estimates simultaneously the motion induced by camera movement. The problem is formulated as a Bayesian motion-based partitioning problem in the spatiotemporal domain of the image sequence. An energy functional is derived from the Bayesian formulation. The Euler-Lagrange descent equations determine simultaneously an estimate of the image motion field induced by camera motion and an estimate of the spatiotemporal motion boundary surface. The Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to the surface is expressed as a level-set partial differential equation for topology independence and numerically stable implementation. The method can be initialized simply and can track multiple objects with nonsimultaneous motions. Velocities on motion boundaries can be estimated from geometrical properties of the motion boundary. Several examples of experimental verification are given using synthetic and real-image sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal motion boundary detection and motion boundary velocity estimation for tracking moving objects with a moving camera: a level sets PDEs approach with concurrent camera motion compensation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2004.836158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/29595/01344038.pdf","startPage":"1473","endPage":"1490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2004.836158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal motion boundary detection and motion boundary velocity estimation for tracking moving objects with a moving camera: a level sets PDEs approach with concurrent camera motion compensation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1344038/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157520","pubMedId":"15540456","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal motion boundary detection and motion boundary velocity estimation for tracking moving objects with a moving camera: a level sets PDEs approach with concurrent camera motion compensation","sourcePdf":"01344038.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071157S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"29595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"29595","articleId":"1344038","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344039,"authors":[{"name":"Shaohua Kevin Zhou","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/29595/1344039/1344039-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaohua Kevin Zhou (S'01) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 1994, the M.Eng. degree in computer engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2004.","He is currently with Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ.

Tracking needs modeling interframe motion and appearance changes, whereas recognition needs modeling appearance changes between frames and gallery images. In conventional tracking algorithms, the appearance model is either fixed or rapidly changing, and the motion model is simply a random walk with fixed noise variance. Also, the number of particles is typically fixed. All these factors make the visual tracker unstable. To stabilize the tracker, we propose the following modifications: an observation model arising from an adaptive appearance model, an adaptive velocity motion model with adaptive noise variance, and an adaptive number of particles. The adaptive-velocity model is derived using a first-order linear predictor based on the appearance difference between the incoming observation and the previous particle configuration. Occlusion analysis is implemented using robust statistics. Experimental results on tracking visual objects in long outdoor and indoor video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracking algorithm. We then perform simultaneous tracking and recognition by embedding them in a particle filter. For recognition purposes, we model the appearance changes between frames and gallery images by constructing the intra- and extrapersonal spaces. Accurate recognition is achieved when confronted by pose and view variations.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2004.836152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/29595/01344039.pdf","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2004.836152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual tracking and recognition using appearance-adaptive models in particle filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344039/","displayDocTitle":"Visual tracking and recognition using appearance-adaptive models in particle filters","volume":"13","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157521","pubMedId":"15540457","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344039/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual tracking and recognition using appearance-adaptive models in particle filters","sourcePdf":"01344039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078092S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"29595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"483","xplore-issue":"29595","articleId":"1344039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344042,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Based on this fact, a novel efficient optimal design method for gain-flattened MW-FRAs is proposed. First, the optimal integral pump spectrum is found by genetic algorithm. Then, the matrix denoting the linear many-to-many relation is calculated. By this matrix, the optimal input pump powers resulting in the optimal pump-power integrals can be easily calculated. The optimal pump spectrum is obtained without time consuming trial-error adjustments or many times numerical simulations. Compared to other existing optimal design methods, our method has a substantial improvement in the efficiency without any expense of accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1344064/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8218800","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A novel efficient optimal design method for gain-flattened multiwavelength pumped fiber Raman amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel efficient optimal design method for gain-flattened multiwavelength pumped fiber Raman amplifier","sourcePdf":"01344064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033636S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"29596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"29596","articleId":"1344064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1344065,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With three fiber Bragg gratings on the FBGA, we demonstrate the encoded chip rate of 1.425 GHz under the driving radio frequency of 475 MHz.

Optimal sampling theory focuses on monitoring a system's status for changes, with limited consideration of future changes or missing information. Models of sampling for coordination and scheduling must consider resolving missing or ambiguous data points. Through field-based observations, we observed that human information-seeking involving this type of sampling balances the need for specific information with the effort required to attain the information, and the accuracy of the information.

It is shown that amplified spontaneous emission acts to decrease the inversion of the wetting layer states, thus helping to quench the gain of these states, which might otherwise dominate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2004.835114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/29598/01344132.pdf","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1539","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2004.835114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation and noise properties of quantum-dot optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Saturation and noise properties of quantum-dot optical amplifiers","volume":"40","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1344132/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184430","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation and noise properties of quantum-dot optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01344132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117063S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"29598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"29598","articleId":"1344132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1344133,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoon Park","affiliation":["Photonic Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Jongwoon Park received the B.S. degree in radio engineering from Kyunghee University, Suwon, Korea, in 1999 and the M.S. degree from the University of Victoria, Victoria, B.C., Canada, in 2001.

The dependence of the device performance on those key design parameters such as the lasing wavelength, light injection direction (co- and contra-propagation), lasing power of the DBR laser, and the biasing condition of the SOA is examined systematically by means of a comprehensive time-domain traveling-wave model. As this integrated structure is particularly designed for high saturation power and fast gain dynamics, these characteristics are simulated and compared with the results from the conventional structures. Depending on different requirements, superior performance on either saturation power or noise figure without compromise on the optical gain can be achieved by different integration configurations (i.e., by different light injection directions). For the structure with the light injection from the output end of the SOA (namely, the integrated SOA-laser structure), the fast gain dynamics is found through simulation, which helps to reduce the large-signal waveform distortion in the amplification of narrow pulses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1344133/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184431","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of semiconductor optical amplifier integrated with DBR laser for high saturation power and fast gain dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of semiconductor optical amplifier integrated with DBR laser for high saturation power and fast gain dynamics","sourcePdf":"01344133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062189S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"29598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"29598","articleId":"1344133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1344136,"authors":[{"name":"M.

When processing SAR images, there is a strong need for statistical models of scattering to take into account multiplicative noise and high dynamics. For instance, the classification process needs to be based on the use of statistics. Our main contribution is the choice of an accurate model for high-resolution SAR images over urban areas and its use in a Markovian classification algorithm. Clutter in SAR images becomes non-Gaussian when the resolution is high or when the area is man-made. Many models have been proposed to fit with non-Gaussian scattering statistics (K, Weibull, Log-normal, Nakagami-Rice, etc.), but none of them is flexible enough to model all kinds of surfaces in our context. As a consequence, we use a mathematical model that relies on the Fisher distribution and the log-moment estimation and which is relevant for one-look data. This estimation method is based on the second-kind statistics, which are detailed in the paper. We also prove its accuracy for urban areas at high resolution. The quality of the classification that is obtained by mixing this model and a Markovian segmentation is high and enables us to distinguish between ground, buildings, and vegetation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new statistical model for Markovian classification of urban areas in high-resolution SAR images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2004.834630","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/29599/01344157.pdf","startPage":"2046","endPage":"2057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2004.834630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A new statistical model for Markovian classification of urban areas in high-resolution SAR images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1344157/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8165107","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new statistical model for Markovian classification of urban areas in high-resolution SAR images","sourcePdf":"01344157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080471S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"29599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"278","xplore-issue":"29599","articleId":"1344157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1344160,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper, a new approach is proposed to extract from multitemporal SAR images two kinds of information: temporal changes (flooded areas, coastline erosion, etc.) and stable spatial features (roads, rivers, etc.). The novelty of the proposed approach is to detect simultaneously these two kinds of discontinuities. In a first step, the contrast and the heterogeneity information is extracted by a \"multitemporal\" application of the ratio of local means and by new three-dimensional texture parameters based on the log-cumulants. In a second step, the resulting attributes that measure the time variability or the presence of spatial features are merged. An interactive fuzzy fusion approach is proposed to provide end-users with a simple and easily understandable tool for tuning the change-detection results. The performances of the proposed attributes and fusion technique are presented on a set of seven multitemporal SAR images acquired by the European Remote Sensing (ERS-1) satellite.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2004.835304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/29599/01344160.pdf","startPage":"2073","endPage":"2084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2004.835304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of log-cumulants to the detection of spatiotemporal discontinuities in multitemporal SAR images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344160/","displayDocTitle":"Application of log-cumulants to the detection of spatiotemporal discontinuities in multitemporal SAR images","volume":"42","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8173909","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344160/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of log-cumulants to the detection of spatiotemporal discontinuities in multitemporal SAR images","sourcePdf":"01344160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090895S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"29599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"29599","articleId":"1344160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":1344161,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The accuracy achieved with usual methods (manual control points extraction, estimation of an analytical deformation model) is not satisfactory for many applications where a subpixel accuracy for each pixel of the image is needed (change detection or image fusion, for instance). Unfortunately, there are few works in the literature about the fine registration of multisensor images and even less about the extension of approaches similar to those based on fine correlation for the case of monomodal imagery. In this paper, we analyze the problem of the automatic multisensor image registration and we introduce similarity measures which can replace the correlation coefficient in a deformation map estimation scheme. We show an example where the deformation map between a radar image and an optical one is fully automatically estimated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the possibility of automatic multisensor image registration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2004.835294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/29599/01344163.pdf","startPage":"2104","endPage":"2120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2004.835294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"On the possibility of automatic multisensor image registration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1344163/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8165109","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the possibility of automatic multisensor image registration","sourcePdf":"01344163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110169S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"29599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"29599","articleId":"1344163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1344181,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

True three-dimensional (3-D) SAR also detects the height distribution, which is of significant interest in airborne reconnaissance, forest inventory, and subsurface or wall-penetrating sensing applications as examples. In this paper, the beam performance of 3-D SAR is studied and compared for different curved line paths, such as circles, ellipses, and spirals ending up with random sampling. Curved path geometry reduces the ambiguity in height angle of traditional multipass SAR, and random path variation further improves the sidelobe suppression. The poor sidelobe suppression of a single circle path is significantly improved in near-range geometry in combination with high range resolution. By introducing a window function dependent on focus point and path position, high sidelobe suppression was achieved in an extended ground area below the circle path.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8165122","htmlLink":"/document/1344182/","displayDocTitle":"Beam characteristics of three-dimensional SAR in curved or random paths","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam characteristics of three-dimensional SAR in curved or random paths","sourcePdf":"01344182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065591S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"29599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"29599","articleId":"1344182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1344201,"authors":[{"name":"B.V.

The repeated component of the data, or signal of interest, is modeled as the mean, while the noise is modeled as the Kronecker product of a spatial and a temporal covariance matrix. The temporal covariance matrix is assumed known or estimated prior to the application of the algorithm. The spatial covariance structure is estimated as part of the maximum-likelihood procedure. The mean matrix representing the signal of interest is assumed to be low-rank due to the temporal and spatial structure of the data. The maximum-likelihood estimates of the components of the low-rank signal structure are derived in order to estimate the signal component. The relationship between this approach and principal component analysis (PCA) is explored. In contrast to prestimulus-based whitening followed by PCA, the maximum-likelihood approach does not require signal-free data for noise whitening. Consequently, the maximum-likelihood approach is much more effective with nonstationary noise and produces better quality whitening for a given data record length. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated using simulated and real MEG data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344201/","volume":"51","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1344201/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184394","pubMedId":"15536900","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-likelihood estimation of low-rank signals for multiepoch MEG/EEG analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-likelihood estimation of low-rank signals for multiepoch MEG/EEG analysis","sourcePdf":"01344201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059249S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"29600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"29600","articleId":"1344201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1344204,"authors":[{"name":"Jinshan Tang","affiliation":["Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA","Virginia Image and Video Processing (VIVA), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/29600/1344204/1344204-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinshan Tang (M'00\u2013SM'03) received the Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.R.

Normally, preamplified electrodes are not used because the mismatch in amplification due to component tolerances leads to a reduced common mode rejection ration (CMRR) (Pallas-Areny and Webster, 1991). We introduce a new technique to restore the CMRR. We do this by adapting the gain of the differential amplifier (DA) following the preamplified electrodes. The technique is based on measuring the transfer function of a chosen common mode signal. The gain of the DA is adjusted by a closed loop controller to maximize the CMRR. With this technique, there is no adverse effect on the ECG or EEG. In this way, the control loop can be operated continuously if needed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1344206/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184399","pubMedId":"15536905","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing interference rejection of preamplified electrodes by automated gain adaption","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing interference rejection of preamplified electrodes by automated gain adaption","sourcePdf":"01344206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070955S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"29600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"29600","articleId":"1344206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1344208,"authors":[{"name":"J. van Pelt","affiliation":["Graduate School Neurosciences Amsterdam, Neurons and Networks Research Group, Netherlands Institute of Brain Research, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/29600/1344208/1344208-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaap van Pelt was born in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on June 14, 1946.

Spontaneous neuronal activity emerged toward the end of the first week in vitro and from then on exhibited periods of elevated firing rates, lasting for a few days up to weeks, which were largely uncorrelated among different recording sites. On a time scale of seconds to minutes, network activity typically displayed an ongoing repetition of distinctive firing patterns, including short episodes of synchronous firing at many sites ( network bursts). Network bursts were highly variable in their individual spatio-temporal firing patterns but showed a remarkably stable underlying probabilistic structure (obtained by summing consecutive bursts) on a time scale of hours. On still longer time scales, network bursts evolved gradually, with a significant broadening (to about 2 s) in the third week in vitro, followed by a drastic shortening after about one month in vitro. Bursts at this age were characterized by highly synchronized onsets reaching peak firing levels within less than ca. 60 ms. This pattern persisted for the rest of the culture period. Throughout the recording period, active sites showed highly persistent temporal relationships within network bursts. These longitudinal recordings of network firing have, thus, brought to light a reproducible pattern of complex changes in spontaneous firing dynamics of bursts during the development of isolated cortical neurons into synaptically interconnected networks.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2004.827936","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/29600/01344208.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2004.827936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term characterization of firing dynamics of spontaneous bursts in cultured neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Long-term characterization of firing dynamics of spontaneous bursts in cultured neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344208/","volume":"51","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1344208/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184401","pubMedId":"15536907","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term characterization of firing dynamics of spontaneous bursts in cultured neural networks","sourcePdf":"01344208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115078S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"29600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"29600","articleId":"1344208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":1344209,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.

Three-dimensional probe structures with microfluidic channels were fabricated using surface micromachining and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) techniques. In vitro functional tests of devices were performed using fluorescence microscopy to record the transient release of Texas Red labeled transferrin (TR-transferrin) and dextran (TR-dextran) from the microchannels into 1% w/v agarose gel. In vivo performance was characterized by inserting devices loaded with TR-transferrin into the premotor cortex of adult male rats. Brain sections were imaged using confocal microscopy. Diffusion of TR-transferrin into the extracellular space and uptake by cells up to 400 /spl mu/m from the implantation site was observed in brain slices taken 1 h postinsertion. The reactive tissue volume, as indicated by the presence of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), was characterized using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The reactive tissue volume extended 600, 800, and 400 /spl mu/m radially from the implantation site at 1 h, 24 h, and 6 weeks following insertion, respectively. These results indicate that diffusion-mediated delivery can be part of an effective intervention strategy for the treatment of reactive tissue responses around chronically implanted intracortical probes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model neural prostheses with integrated microfluidics: a potential intervention strategy for controlling reactive cell and tissue responses","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2004.834288","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/29600/01344209.pdf","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2004.834288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29600","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Model neural prostheses with integrated microfluidics: a potential intervention strategy for controlling reactive cell and tissue responses","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1344209/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184402","pubMedId":"15536908","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model neural prostheses with integrated microfluidics: a potential intervention strategy for controlling reactive cell and tissue responses","sourcePdf":"01344209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108359S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"29600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"29600","articleId":"1344209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1344216,"authors":[{"name":"A.

CMOS translinear circuits, with particular emphasis on log-domain techniques, have been exploited in order to contain current consumption and to allow correct operation with a reduced supply voltage, due to battery discharging. Indeed, the realized system can operate down to 1.8 V of supply voltage and dissipates at most 1.8 /spl mu/A, granting at least 47 dB of dynamic range (DR) for the atrial chain, which is compatible with advanced digital sensing. Current consumption can be further reduced at the expense of DR if a simpler sensing like peak detection is adopted. All system performance have been verified by measurements results and are compatible with the requirements of cardiac pacemakers.

These compressor architectures are anatomized into their constituent modules and different static logic styles based on the same deep submicrometer CMOS process model are used to realize them. Different configurations of each architecture, which include a number of novel 4-2 and 5-2 compressor designs, are prototyped and simulated to evaluate their performance in speed, power dissipation and power-delay product. The newly developed circuits are based on various configurations of the novel 5-2 compressor architecture with the new carry generator circuit, or existing architectures configured with the proposed circuit for the exclusive OR (XOR) and exclusive NOR ( XNOR) [XOR-XNOR] module. The proposed new circuit for the XOR-XNOR module eliminates the weak logic on the internal nodes of pass transistors with a pair of feedback PMOS-NMOS transistors. Driving capability has been considered in the design as well as in the simulation setup so that these 4-2 and 5-2 compressor cells can operate reliably in any tree structured parallel multiplier at very low supply voltages. Two new simulation environments are created to ensure that the performances reflect the realistic circuit operation in the system to which these cells are integrated. Simulation results show that the 4-2 compressor with the proposed XOR-XNOR module and the new fast 5-2 compressor architecture are able to function at supply voltage as low as 0.6 V, and outperform many other architectures including the classical CMOS logic compressors and variants of compressors constructed with various combinations of recently reported superior low-power logic cells.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2004.835683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2004.835683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/29601/01344222.pdf","startPage":"1985","endPage":"1997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra low-voltage low-power CMOS 4-2 and 5-2 compressors for fast arithmetic circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Ultra low-voltage low-power CMOS 4-2 and 5-2 compressors for fast arithmetic circuits","volume":"51","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344222/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157532","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344222/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra low-voltage low-power CMOS 4-2 and 5-2 compressors for fast arithmetic circuits","sourcePdf":"01344222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124236S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"29601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"29601","articleId":"1344222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1344224,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Hong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/29601/1344224/1344224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Che-Hong Chen was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1974.

The 2-D DCT/IDCT are first decomposed into cosine-cosine and sine-sine transforms. Based on indexes of transform bases, the regular pre-addition preprocess is established and the recursive structures for 2-D DCT/IDCT, which can be realized in a second-order infinite-impulse response (IIR) filter, are derived without involving any transposition procedure. For computation of 2-D DCT/IDCT, the recursive loops of the proposed structures are less than that of one-dimensional DCT/IDCT recursive structures, which require data transposition to achieve the so-called row-column approach. With advantages of fewer recursive loops and no transposition, the proposed recursive structures achieve more accurate results and less power consumption than the existed methods. The regular and modular properties are suitable for very large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation. By using similar procedures, the recursive structures for 2-D DST and 2-D IDST are also proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct recursive structures for computing radix-r two-dimensional DCT/IDCT/DST/IDST","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2004.835685","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/29601/01344224.pdf","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2004.835685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Direct recursive structures for computing radix-r two-dimensional DCT/IDCT/DST/IDST","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1344224/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157534","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct recursive structures for computing radix-r two-dimensional DCT/IDCT/DST/IDST","sourcePdf":"01344224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095142S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"29601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"29601","articleId":"1344224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1344226,"authors":[{"name":"Jayadeva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/29601/1344226/1344226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jayadeva (M'94) received the B.

We investigate the operating characteristics of a machine consisting of a feedback loop containing an adder, a linear filter, and a noninverting Schmitt trigger. We show that the amplitude information of a bandlimited signal can be perfectly recovered if the difference between any two consecutive values of the time sequence is bounded by the inverse of the Nyquist rate. We also show how to build a nonlinear inverse time decoding machine (TDM) that perfectly recovers the amplitude information from the time sequence. We demonstrate the close relationship between the recovery algorithms for time encoding and irregular sampling. We also show the close relationship between time encoding and a number of nonlinear modulation schemes including FM and asynchronous sigma-delta modulation. We analyze the sensitivity of the time encoding recovery algorithm and demonstrate how to construct a TDM that perfectly recovers the amplitude information from the time sequence and is trigger parameter insensitive. We derive bounds on the error in signal recovery introduced by the quantization of the time sequence. We compare these with the recovery error introduced by the quantization of the amplitude of the bandlimited signal when irregular sampling is employed. Under Nyquist-type rate conditions, quantization of a bandlimited signal in the time and amplitude domains are shown to be largely equivalent methods of information representation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/29601/01344228.pdf","startPage":"2060","endPage":"2073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2004.835026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2004.835026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect recovery and sensitivity analysis of time encoded bandlimited signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity analysis","Encoding","Quantization","Time division multiplexing","Sampling methods","Feedback loop","Nonlinear filters","Trigger circuits","Decoding","Delta-sigma modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","signal representation","quantisation (signal)","bandlimited signals","encoding","decoding","sensitivity analysis","sigma-delta modulation","frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfect recovery","sensitivity analysis","time encoded bandlimited signals","time encoding machine","real-time asynchronous mechanism","amplitude information encoding","time sequence","feedback loop","adder","linear filter","noninverting Schmitt trigger","Nyquist rate inverse","nonlinear inverse time decoding machine","recovery algorithms","irregular sampling","nonlinear modulation schemes","frequency modulation","asynchronous sigma-delta modulation","time encoding recovery algorithm","signal recovery","signal quantization","sampling methods","signal representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Perfect recovery and sensitivity analysis of time encoded bandlimited signals","volume":"51","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1344228/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157538","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect recovery and sensitivity analysis of time encoded bandlimited signals","sourcePdf":"01344228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080019S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"29601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"29601","articleId":"1344228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344229,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/29601/1344229/1344229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiang Li was born in China in 1975.

In this work, we study the control of random networks and scale-free networks. Conditions are investigated for globally or locally stabilizing such networks. Our strategy is to apply local feedback control to a small fraction of network nodes. We propose the concept of virtual control for microscopic dynamics throughout the process with different pinning schemes for both random networks and scale-free networks. We explain the main reason why significantly less local controllers are required by specifically pinning the most highly connected nodes in a scale-free network than those required by the randomly pinning scheme, and why there is no significant difference between specifically and randomly pinning schemes for controlling random dynamical networks. We also study the synchronization phenomenon of controlled dynamical networks in the stabilization process, both analytically and numerically.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2004.835655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2004.835655","startPage":"2074","endPage":"2087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/29601/01344229.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pinning a complex dynamical network to its equilibrium","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Pinning a complex dynamical network to its equilibrium","volume":"51","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8157539","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1344229/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pinning a complex dynamical network to its equilibrium","sourcePdf":"01344229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093729S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"29601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"728","xplore-issue":"29601","articleId":"1344229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1344230,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Possible applications will strongly depend on a successful implementation of on-chip hit recognition and sparsification schemes. The task is tough, first because of very small signal amplitudes (/spl sim/ mV), which are of the same order of magnitude as natural dispersions in the transistor threshold voltages, secondly because of the limitation to use only one type of transistor over the sensitive area. This paper presents a 30/spl times/128 pixel prototype chip, featuring fast, column parallel signal processing. The pixel concept combines in-pixel amplification with double sampling operation. The pixel output is a differential current signal proportional to the difference between the reference level and the charge collected. The readout of the pixel is two-phase, matching discrimination circuitry implemented at the end of each column. Low-noise discriminators feature autozero functionality. The details of the chip design are presented. Difficulties, encountered in the first attempt to address on-line hit recognition, are reported. Performances of the pixel and discriminator blocks, determined in separate measurements, are discussed. An important part of this paper consists of results of first tests performed with soft X-rays from a /sup 55/Fe source.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2004.835551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2004.835551","startPage":"2313","endPage":"2321","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/29603/01344330.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic active pixel sensors with in-pixel double sampling operation and column-level discrimination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic active pixel sensors with in-pixel double sampling operation and column-level discrimination","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","volume":"51","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344330/","accessionNumber":"8164944","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344330/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic active pixel sensors with in-pixel double sampling operation and column-level discrimination","sourcePdf":"01344330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080208S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"29603","articleId":"1344330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1344338,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

This detector has 24 000 channels of time and amplitude readout. The system operates in a high singles count-rate environment, and continuously digitizes the incoming pulses of every channel, using a latency buffer to temporarily hold this information. For each event, channel occupancy signals are sent to a local logic analyzer. Thus, the system can be self-triggered or triggered by a coincidence of the internally generated occupancy signal with an external gate. Upon presentation of a valid trigger, all data stored in the latency buffer are then read with zero-suppression to local RAM. The readout can provide sub-nanosecond timing and 6-9-bit amplitude resolution. This digitizer design will be implemented in an ASIC due to the large number of readout channels, the requirement that the data initially flow in parallel because of high single rates, and the large number of memory buffers. The digitizer is controlled by an FPGA, and the system clock can be varied between 15-60 MHz. This paper presents the conceptual design for the MECO readout system, but we anticipate that it can be used for many other applications requiring the acquisition of time and waveform signals in high counting rate environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Delay","Buffer storage","Detectors","Logic","Signal analysis","Signal generators","Read-write memory","Signal

quantum noise is present in extremely low dose X-ray CT imaging, statistical properties of the data has to be considered to achieve a satisfactory image reconstruction. Statistical iterative reconstruction with accurate modeling of the noise, rather than a filtered back-projection (FBP) with low-pass filtering, is one way to deal with the problem. Estimating a noise-free sinogram to satisfy the FBP reconstruction for the Radon transform is another way. The benefits of the latter include a higher computation efficiency, more uniform spatial resolution in the reconstructed image, and less modification of the current machine configurations. In a clinic X-ray CT system, the acquired raw data must be calibrated, in addition to the logarithmic transform, to achieve the high diagnostic image quality. The calibrated projection data or sinogram no longer follow a compound Poisson distribution in general, but are close to a Gaussian distribution with signal-dependent variance. In this paper, we first investigated a relatively accurate statistical model for the sinogram data, based on several phantom experiments. Then we developed a penalized likelihood method to smooth the sinogram, which led to a set of nonlinear equations that can be solved by iterated conditional mode (ICM) algorithm within a reasonable computing time. The method was applied to several experimental datasets acquired at 120 kVp, 10 mA/20 mA/50 mA protocols with a GE HiSpeed multi-slice detector CT scanner and demonstrated a significant noise suppression without noticeable sacrifice of the spatial resolution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1344369/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155322","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear sinogram smoothing for low-dose X-ray CT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear sinogram smoothing for low-dose X-ray CT","sourcePdf":"01344369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067283S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"29604","articleId":"1344369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1344371,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We have utilized theoretical simulations and experimental measurements to investigate the design and performance of pixelated LaBr/sub 3/ Anger-logic detectors suitable for use in a TOF PET scanner. Our results indicate that excellent energy resolution can be obtained from individual as well as multicrystal arrays of LaBr/sub 3/ in a 4 mm/spl times/4 mm /spl times/ 30 mm geometry. Measured energy resolutions (at 511 keV) of 4.1% for a single crystal and an average of 5.1% for an array of 100 crystals have been achieved with our best samples. Both simulations and experimental measurements of an Anger-logic based detector consisting of the LaBr/sub 3/ crystal array coupled to a continuous light guide and seven photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), have resulted in the ability to clearly discriminate 511 keV interactions in each crystal. We have measured coincidence time resolutions for both 0.5% and 5.0% cerium-doped LaBr/sub 3/ and found that the higher level of Ce-doping yielded superior results with little to no degradation in light output or energy resolution. The time resolution for a single 5.0% Ce-doped LaBr/sub 3/ crystal (4 mm /spl times/ 4 mm /spl times/ 30 mm) coupled directly to a PMT was measured to be 275 ps full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). With an array of 100 crystals coupled to a light guide and seven PMT cluster an average time resolution of 290 ps FWHM was obtained by summing the signals from the PMT cluster. Ultimately, two 5.0% Ce-doped LaBr/sub 3/ Anger-logic detectors placed in coincidence yielded a time resolution of 313 ps FWHM.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/29604/01344376.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2004.835777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2004.835777","startPage":"2550","endPage":"2557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a lanthanum bromide detector for time-of-flight PET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344376/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a lanthanum bromide detector for time-of-flight PET","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344376/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"8155329","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a lanthanum bromide detector for time-of-flight PET","sourcePdf":"01344376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071428S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"29604","articleId":"1344376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344381,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This work explores incorporation of motion information into expectation-maximization (EM) reconstruction algorithms. An important issue addressed is the existence of lines-of-response (LORs) corresponding to no actual pairs of detectors and their motion-induced \"interaction\" with the detectable LORs. An example of this is a scanner design with gaps existing in between the detector heads. It is shown that to properly account for such LORs in histogram-mode and list-mode EM reconstructions, in addition to motion correction of the events, the algorithms themselves must be modified. This modification is implemented by including motion-compensated sensitivity correction factors. We are able to demonstrate experimentally that the proposed approach resolves image artifacts that can appear when the conventional purely event-driven motion correction technique is used. An alternate image-space-based method for calculation of motion-compensated sensitivity factors is also derived, applicable in both histogram-mode and list-mode reconstruction tasks, which has the potential of being considerably faster in presence of frequent motion, especially in high-resolution tomographs.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2004.835763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/29604/01344381.pdf","startPage":"2588","endPage":"2596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2004.835763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensation in histogram-mode and list-mode EM reconstructions: beyond the event-driven approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344381/","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensation in histogram-mode and list-mode EM reconstructions: beyond the event-driven approach","volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155334","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344381/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensation in histogram-mode and list-mode EM reconstructions: beyond the event-driven approach","sourcePdf":"01344381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085959S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"29604","articleId":"1344381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1344389,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ming Zheng","affiliation":["School of Clinical Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Xiao Ming Zheng","id":"37088128349"},{"name":"I.G.

Generally, a large number of input energy windows are required within the network structure while the commercial cameras have only 3-8 energy windows. It is difficult to use two input windows within the ANN structure for the crosstalk contamination corrections of /sup 99m/Tc//sup 123/I images acquired using only two photopeak energy windows. In this paper, we designed an ANN network with 24 inputs, 32 nodes in the hidden layer and two nodes in the output layer, to correct for crosstalk contamination in /sup 99m/Tc//sup 123/I images acquired using two photopeak windows. We trained the network using experimentally acquired /sup 99m/Tc and /sup 123/I spectrum data using the RSD brain phantom. The neural network package Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNSv4.2), from the University of Stuttgart, was used for the neural network training and the crosstalk corrections. Two sets of image data were tested. The first was a human activation study and the other used a cylindrical striatal phantom. Our results show a great improvement on both the human activation and the cylindrical striatal phantom images. Further work is to test our new approach on more /sup 99m/Tc//sup 123/I imaging data and apply it to other radionuclide combinations such as /sup 201/Tl//sup 99m/Tc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344389/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8155342","volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1344389/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Correction for crosstalk contaminations in dual radionuclide /sup 99m/Tc and /sup 123/I images using artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correction for crosstalk contaminations in dual radionuclide /sup 99m/Tc and /sup 123/I images using artificial neural network","sourcePdf":"01344389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081551S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"29604","articleId":"1344389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1344399,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, anesthesia profoundly affects the neurological state of the animal, complicating the interpretation of PET data. Furthermore, it precludes the use of PET to study the brain during normal behavior. The rat conscious animal PET tomograph (RatCAP) is designed to eliminate the need for anesthesia in rat brain studies. It is a miniaturized full-ring PET scanner that is attached directly to the head, imaging nearly the entire brain. RatCAP utilizes arrays of 2 mm /spl times/ 2 mm LSO crystals coupled to matching avalanche photodiode arrays, which are in turn read out by full custom integrated circuits. Principal challenges have been addressed considering the physical constraints on size, weight, and heat generation in addition to the usual requirements of small-animal PET, such as high spatial resolution in the presence of parallax error. A partial prototype has been constructed and preliminary measurements and optimization completed. Realistic Monte Carlo simulations have also been carried out to optimize system performance, which is predicted to be competitive with existing microPET systems.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2004.835740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/29604/01344399.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2004.835740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29604","startPage":"2718","endPage":"2722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RatCAP: miniaturized head-mounted PET for conscious rodent brain imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RatCAP: miniaturized head-mounted PET for conscious rodent brain imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155352","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1344399/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RatCAP: miniaturized head-mounted PET for conscious rodent brain imaging","sourcePdf":"01344399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095469S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"29604","articleId":"1344399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1344413,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

Semiconductor manufacturers can use a combination of design and/or process techniques to eliminate known radiation-induced parasitic leakage paths. However, unknown or critical radiation-induced parasitic leakage may still exist on fully processed ICs and it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to identify these leakage paths based on radiation induced parametric degradation. We show that light emission microscopy can be used to identify the location of radiation-induced parasitic leakage paths in ICs. This is illustrated by using light emission microscopy to find radiation-induced parasitic leakage paths in partially-depleted silicon on insulator static random-access memories (SRAMs). Once leakage paths were identified, modifications were made to the SRAM design to improve the total dose radiation hardness of the SRAMs. Light emission microscopy should prove to be an important tool for the development of future radiation hardened technologies and devices.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2004.835074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/29605/01344417.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2004.835074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"2782","endPage":"2786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of radiation-induced parasitic leakage paths using light emission microscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Identification of radiation-induced parasitic leakage paths using light emission microscopy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344417/","volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1344417/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8155361","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of radiation-induced parasitic leakage paths using light emission microscopy","sourcePdf":"01344417.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06085S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"29605","articleId":"1344417","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344420,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The process investigated in this work, originally designed for the fabrication of silicon detectors to be operated in a fully depleted condition, has been tuned to embed N-channel JFETs, NMOS devices and bipolar transistors in the same high resistivity substrate. The most significant electrical parameters have been monitored after exposing the test structures to different proton fluences in order to characterize their total dose and bulk damage response.

Throughout satellite design, simulations can be made to estimate the mission single event upset (SEU) rate. One of the most used models to predict in-orbit SEU rate is cosmic ray effects on microelectronics (CREME96). CREME96 treats solar particle events on the basis of a specific event-October 1989. Some engineering applications require evaluation of expected SEU behavior in a range of SPE types. In addition, comparison cannot be made directly between in-flight SEU behavior during SPEs and the CREME96 prediction. To address these issues, we examine the feasibility of using available environmental datasets to derive linear energy transfer (LET) spectra. We find serious problems with many datasets, particularly with availability of data during the most significant SPEs. It is also difficult to derive data on SEU behavior of systems. Where comparisons are possible, we find that shielding plays a significant role. Again, obtaining shielding data concerning a part proves difficult. Recommendations are made with respect to environmental data sources, analysis methods and engineering procedures to safeguard \"lessons learned\" type exercises/comparison of prediction. Three different SPEs [November 6, 1997, July 14, 2000, and November 9, 2000] have been evaluated.

The signal probabilities of the lines can be used to detect SEU sensitive subcircuits of a given combinational circuit. The circuit can be hardened against SEUs by selectively applying triple modular redundancy (STMR) to these sensitive subcircuits. However, there is an increase in the number of the voter circuits required for the STMR circuits. Virtex has abundant number of tri-state buffers that can be employed to construct SEU immune majority voter circuits. We also present a SEU fault insertion simulator designed to introduce errors representing SEUs in the circuits. STMR method is thoroughly tested on MCNC'91 benchmarks. With a small loss of SEU immunity, the proposed STMR method can greatly reduce the area overhead of the hardened circuit when compared to the state-of-the-art triple modular redundancy (TMR). STMR method along with the readback and reconfiguration feature of Virtex can result in very high SEU immunity.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2004.834955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/29606/01344451.pdf","startPage":"2957","endPage":"2969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2004.834955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective triple Modular redundancy (STMR) based single-event upset (SEU) tolerant synthesis for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Selective triple Modular redundancy (STMR) based single-event upset (SEU) tolerant synthesis for FPGAs","volume":"51","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8155387","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344451/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344451/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective triple Modular redundancy (STMR) based single-event upset (SEU) tolerant synthesis for FPGAs","sourcePdf":"01344451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187053S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"29606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"29606","articleId":"1344451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344459,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This paper addresses the problem of coherent/fully correlated source localization using vector sensor arrays. The maximum likelihood (ML) and minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) estimators for source direction-of-arrival (DOA) and signal polarization parameters are derived. These estimators require no search over the polarization parameters. In addition, a novel method for \"decorrelating\" the incident signals is presented. This method is based on the polarization smoothing algorithm (PSA) and enables the use of eigenstructure-based techniques, which assume uncorrelated or partially correlated signals. The method is implemented as a preprocessing stage before applying eigenstructure-based techniques, such as MUSIC. Unlike other existing preprocessing techniques, such as spatial smoothing and forward-backward (FB) averaging, this method is not limited to any specific array geometry. The performance of the proposed PSA preprocessing combined with MUSIC is evaluated and compared to the Crame/spl acute/r-Rao Bound (CRB) and the ML and MVDR estimators. Simulation results show that the MVDR and PSA-MUSIC asymptotically achieve the CRB for a scenario with two coherent sources with and without an uncorrelated interference source. A sensitivity study of PSA-MUSIC to source polarization was also conducted via simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.836456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29607/01344459.pdf","startPage":"3096","endPage":"3103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.836456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source localization using vector sensor array in a multipath environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344459/","displayDocTitle":"Source localization using vector sensor array in a multipath environment","volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157478","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344459/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source localization using vector sensor array in a multipath environment","sourcePdf":"01344459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065246S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"29607","articleId":"1344459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1344460,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, the graphs describing typical real-world phenomena contain many cycles, making direct estimation procedures prohibitively costly. In this paper, we develop an iterative inference algorithm for general Gaussian graphical models. It operates by exactly solving a series of modified estimation problems on spanning trees embedded within the original cyclic graph. When these subproblems are suitably chosen, the algorithm converges to the correct conditional means. Moreover, and in contrast to many other iterative methods, the tree-based procedures we propose can also be used to calculate exact error variances. Although the conditional mean iteration is effective for quite densely connected graphical models, the error variance computation is most efficient for sparser graphs. In this context, we present a modeling example suggesting that very sparsely connected graphs with cycles may provide significant advantages relative to their tree-structured counterparts, thanks both to the expressive power of these models and to the efficient inference algorithms developed herein. The convergence properties of the proposed tree-based iterations are characterized both analytically and experimentally. In addition, by using the basic tree-based iteration to precondition the conjugate gradient method, we develop an alternative, accelerated iteration that is finitely convergent. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate this algorithm's effectiveness on several inference problems, including a prototype distributed sensing application.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.836539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.836539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29607/01344463.pdf","startPage":"3136","endPage":"3150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded trees: estimation of Gaussian Processes on graphs with cycles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Embedded trees: estimation of Gaussian Processes on graphs with cycles","volume":"52","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344463/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157482","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344463/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded trees: estimation of Gaussian Processes on graphs with cycles","sourcePdf":"01344463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109087S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"29607","articleId":"1344463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1344468,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

The basic idea is to divide a vector space into two orthogonal subspaces of which one is spanned by the error locator vectors. The locations of the errors are estimated from the spanning eigenvectors of the complement subspace. However, unlike the subspace approach in DOA estimation, which is similar to estimating the subspaces from the syndrome covariance matrix after a projection, in the proposed approach, the subspaces are estimated from the modified syndrome covariance matrix after a whitening transform. Simulation results with a Gauss-Markov source reveal that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the coding theoretic approach on impulsive channels as well as the subspace approach with projection on lossy channels.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.836464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29607/01344472.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.836464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29607","startPage":"3241","endPage":"3252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace-based error and erasure correction with DFT codes for wireless channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subspace-based error and erasure correction with DFT codes for wireless channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157491","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1344472/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace-based error and erasure correction with DFT codes for wireless channels","sourcePdf":"01344472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109365S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"29607","articleId":"1344472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1344473,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The bound is obtained in a constructive way by evaluating the asymptotic performance of an estimator that fully exploits the algebraic structure of the multipath channel. In particular, the estimator is assumed to be able to estimate the long-term features of the channel consistently (e.g., second order statistics of fading, delays, angles) while tracking the fast-varying fading fluctuations by Wiener filtering. Known estimators that are able to attain the bound under simplified settings are referred to, and general guidelines for designing novel estimators are discussed. Based on the simple analytical expression of the bound, the impact of channel estimation error on the link capacity is investigated for different system parameters and channel characteristics (e.g., Doppler shift, spatial correlation of fading). Numerical results are provided to corroborate the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.836534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29607/01344474.pdf","startPage":"3265","endPage":"3277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.836534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower bound on training-based channel estimation error for frequency-selective block-fading Rayleigh MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344474/","displayDocTitle":"Lower bound on training-based channel estimation error for frequency-selective block-fading Rayleigh MIMO channels","volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157493","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344474/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower bound on training-based channel estimation error for frequency-selective block-fading Rayleigh MIMO channels","sourcePdf":"01344474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135137S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"29607","articleId":"1344474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344499,"authors":[{"name":"Chair","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Center for Applied Electromagnetic Systems Research (CAESR), University of Mississippi, MS, USA"],"lastName":"Chair","id":"37281103800"},{"name":"Kishk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Center for Applied Electromagnetic Systems Research (CAESR), University of Mississippi, MS, USA"],"lastName":"Kishk","id":"37281343400"},{"name":"Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Center for Applied Electromagnetic Systems Research (CAESR), University of Mississippi, MS, USA"],"lastName":"Lee","id":"37281491000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"1344499","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":172,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coplanar waveguides","Rectangular waveguides","Slot antennas","Ultra wideband antennas","Bandwidth","Antenna measurements","Impedance measurement","Bidirectional control","Antenna radiation patterns","Pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","slot antennas","ultra wideband antennas","coplanar waveguides","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed slot antenna","ultrawide-band antenna","coplanar waveguide-fed antenna","rectangular slot antenna","CPW","U-shaped tuning stub","impedance bandwidth","bi-directional radiation","radiation patterns","50 ohm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawide-band coplanar waveguide-fed rectangular slot antenna","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2004.836580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=28658","endPage":"229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/28658/01344499.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2004.836580","startPage":"227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1344499","abstract":"An ultrawide-band coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed slot antenna is presented.

The network weights are determined by minimizing the traditional backpropagation error function. The difference is that the optimization based learning algorithm utilizes stochastic technique, based on the use of low discrepancy sequences. This technique searches the parameter space, defined by the network weights, to define initial regions of attraction with candidates for local minima, and then exploits each region to locate the minima, and to determine a global minimum. The proposed technique is initially tested on multimodal mathematical functions and subsequently applied for training NN with moderate size for solving simple benchmark problems. Finally, the results are analysed, discussed, and compared with others.","doi":"10.1109/IS.2004.1344633","startPage":"34","endPage":"39 Vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 2nd International IEEE Conference on 'Intelligent Systems'.

The performance of transceivers is very sensitive to nonlinear distortions, which arise mainly from the high power amplifier (HPA). Also, because of the wideband signals, the nonlinear distortions are frequency-dependent. The paper proposes an algebraic solution to compensate at the transmitter for the HPA nonlinearity. The HPA is represented by a memoryless nonlinear block followed by a linear filter. We first estimate the parameters of the unknown nonlinearity, which is modelled through a polynomial expansion. The frequency response of the unknown filter is then calculated, in order to capture the memory effects in the system. Using the identified nonlinear system parameters, a cascade of the inverse filter and the inverse memoryless nonlinearity is constructed preceding the HPA, in order to predistort the input signals and achieve overall linear transmitter characteristics. The scheme is examined through computer simulations for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Improvements in the bit error rate (BER) and out-of-band spectrum regrowth are demonstrated for the travelling wave tube (TWT) HPA model. The results show that the proposed method is effective in compensating for amplitude-to-amplitude (AM/AM) distortions with memory using a relatively-small number of data points at the identification stage.","doi":"10.1109/DNSR.2004.1344701","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The use of this algorithm considerably reduces the number of operations as well as the total cost of the proposed detector. A 5-user DS-CDMA system is adopted to examine the performance of the /spl mu/GA detector. Using computer simulations, it is shown that the proposed /spl mu/GA receiver achieves a performance close to the optimal detector as measured by the bit-error-rate (BER).

Providing the relevant information to users to cater to their needs is the primary goal of Website owners. Therefore, finding the content of the Web and retrieving the users' interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important. Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing user behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in Web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that WPR performs better than the conventional PageRank algorithm in terms of returning a larger number of relevant pages to a given query.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344743/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1344743/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8001730","conferenceDate":"21-21 May 2004","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Weighted PageRank algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted PageRank algorithm","confLoc":"Fredericton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01344743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073348S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9316","isNumber":"29617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9316","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"29617","articleId":"1344743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1344746,"authors":[{"name":"Xinping Zeng","affiliation":["Microwave and Wireless Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"lastName":"Xinping Zeng","id":"37272247500"},{"name":"Zhizhang Chen","affiliation":["Microwave and Wireless Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhizhang Chen","id":"37335571800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2096-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1344746","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":182},"abstract":"A subharmonic injection-locked oscillating antenna, operating simultaneously as a frequency doubler and as a QPSK modulator, is presented.

An application to sizing of standalone PV systems design method of an unknown optimal sizing combination is presented. These optimal sizing combinations allow to the users of stand-alone PV systems to determine the number of solar panel modules and storage batteries necessary to satisfy a given consumption, especially in isolated sites where the global solar radiation data is not always available. A developed model combine between multilayer perceptron (MLP) and infinite impulse filter (MR), this IIR recurrent structures is combined by cascading to the network to provide double locale structure resulting in improving speed of learning. The MLP-IIR model has been trained by using 200 known sizing combinations data corresponding to 200 locations. In this way, the adaptive model was trained to accept and even handle a number of unusual cases. Known sizing coefficients were subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of estimation. The training MLP-IIR model was performed with adequate accuracy. Subsequently, the unknown validation sizing coefficients set produced very set accurate estimation with the correlation coefficient between the actual and the MLP-IIR model estimated data of 98% was obtained. This result indicates that the proposed method can be successfully used for estimating of optimal sizing combinations of stand-alone PV systems for any locations in Algeria, but the methodology can be generalized using different locations in the world. Also, obtained results by feed-forward (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) and an adaptive MLP-IIR model have been compared with measured data in order to illustrate the importance of the new developed model. Possible application can be found in: rural sites, pumping water, electrification in isolated sites.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344762/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8107564","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1344762/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network adaptive wavelets for sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network adaptive wavelets for sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic systems","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"01344762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074828S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9314","isNumber":"29614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9314","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"29614","articleId":"1344762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1344806,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach works well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1344849/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8109186","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1344849/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based fuzzy controller for nonlinear systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based fuzzy controller for nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"01344849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048595S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9314","isNumber":"29622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9314","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"29622","articleId":"1344849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1344850,"authors":[{"name":"I.V.

A synchronization waveform is embedded within data in the form of pilot tones. Selection of the sub-channel locations to be reserved for synchronization pilots is critical, as each different selection results in a waveform with a different sidelobe pattern. The optimal pilot tone location selection problem is mathematically intractable and an exhaustive search for practical systems is infeasible. A genetic algorithm is employed for searching the locations of a number of pilot tones among all OFDM subcarriers, such that the resulting time waveform has good autocorrelation properties. The performance of the generated synchronization waveforms was evaluated in a simulated OFDM system and it was demonstrated that they achieve the desired frame synchronization performance. It was observed that the genetic algorithm accomplishes the task much faster than a random search.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Search for OFDM synchronization waveforms with good aperiodic autocorrelations","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The EM-algorithm performs joint channel estimation and sequence detection. Employing BPSK modulation, simulation results show that the EM-based receiver outperforms standard ST-MSDD receivers after three iterations.

IR systems do not interfere (EMI) with RF systems. However, limitations over power emission levels (IEC825), noise due to ambient lighting and multipath dispersion remain as hurdles in high-speed environments. Especially, the IR signal is severely impaired by high frequency interference produced by fluorescent lights with electronic ballast in indoor LAN environments. Spread spectrum techniques improve the performance in this scenario at the expense of increased bandwidth. In this paper, an adaptive FIR filter is trained to cancel both the multipath dispersion and the fluorescent light interference in an IR system. From analytical and simulation results, it is shown that the adaptive filter greatly enhances the inherent noise rejection capability of CDMA systems.

Evaluation of the MIMO achievable capacity requires knowledge of the RF channel matrix. A common approach is to assume a Rayleigh fading channel and, accordingly, evaluate the statistical average of the capacity. This simple approach neglects the dependence of the capacity on the specific propagation environment. Alternatively, in this work, we use a deterministic approach based on the simulation of the RF propagation channel matrix for specific scenarios, which includes the propagation characteristics. Consequently, the RF channel matrix can be found, yielding the deterministic MIMO capacity. The objective of this work is to show how an oversimplification of the RF simulation characteristics (number of rays, planar/non-planar reflection tracing and wall thickness) affects the evaluated deterministic MIMO capacity.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1344996","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Kalman filtering (KF), in its prediction form, is employed to track the fading channel in a multiple-antenna system, using orthogonal space-time codes and three different decoders. The system's performance is evaluated through computer simulations. The effect of the Doppler rate on the channel estimation and decoding scheme is investigated. The results show that the performance degrades as the Doppler frequency increases. Furthermore, the effect of channel estimation on the decoders' performance is examined. It is shown that when channel estimation errors cannot be kept sufficiently small, then a simple symbol by symbol decoder provides the same performance as a joint decoder.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29618","startPage":"253","endPage":"256 Vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel5/9317/29618/01345004.pdf","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The rates of the codes vary from 8/10 to 8/19 and employing them in a type-II hybrid ARQ scheme results in a throughput which is only 0.7 dB away from the Shannon limit.

Denoising is a compromise between the removal of the largest possible amount of noise and the preservation of signal integrity. To achieve a good implementation of this compromise we purpose the following procedure. The signal to be denoised is decomposed using wavelet packets up to the seventh level using DB11 wavelets. The /spl mu/-law thresholding is applied to all the final decomposition level subband coefficients except those of the two lower subbands on which soft thresholding is applied. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a clean speech dataset from the TIMIT database, corrupted with pink noise, for SNR levels ranging from 5 to 15 dB has been utilized. It has been found that the results obtained by our method are better than those given by each one of the two combined methods used separately.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345019","endPage":"318 Vol.1","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Power control is one of the most important processes as the interference is the predominant factor that influences the capacity and signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) in cellular CDMA networks. In this paper, we propose an integrated pilot power based power control (PPBPC) algorithm which is simple and decentralized, uses transmit power control and adapts cell sizes for load distribution. We show that uniform SINR is achieved for all users in each cell if it is feasible and it occurs when the algorithm converges while loads are nearly balanced.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345022","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Simulations are conducted for a 2/spl times/2 MIMO system using the the finite element method, which is particularly well suited for this kind of problem. First, each antenna is optimized independently from the other by optimizing its shape and location in a manner that insures optimal input impedance and excitation of a single mode. Subsequently, the two antennas are placed together and a final optimization is carried out to reduce their mutual coupling and improve the impedance matching. The results obtained for a 2/spl times/2 MIMO system clearly show the significance of practical antenna considerations on MIMO capacity in a waveguide environment.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345027","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The Subcarrier and Bit Joint Allocation (SBJA) algorithm is proposed under the TDD mode of operation. Our objective is to maximize the overall data rate while simultaneously satisfying the requirements on each user's quality of service (QoS), the total transmit power. The proposed algorithm has two steps by considering the user who just arrives and users in service respectively. Through introduction of 'service load', different kinds of traffic have the same standard to compare. Simulation results show that SBJA algorithm can reduce outage percentage and increase the capacity of the system effectively over the fixed subcarrier and bit allocation. Moreover, the complexity of system realization in the SBJA algorithm is much less than that of rate adaptive (RA) optimization, while the spectral efficiency of SBJA can be close to that of the RA optimization.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345035","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The techniques that can successfully manage the interference can improve the average rate of transmission. We propose a new scheduling scheme which coordinates the transmission between intercell mobile terminals (MTs) in a downlink CDMA system. In our scheme, we divide the cell into two flexible concentric areas based on the traffic load in the cell. The base stations (BSs) allocate the transmission power based on the distance between MTs and BSs. When one BS transmits data to an MT which is located in the inner area with less power, the neighboring BS transmits data to an MT located in the outer area with more power and vice versa. The proposed coordinated scheduling can increase the capacity of the system as well as save energy by controlling the power. Our analysis shows that it improves the performance of the MT which is located near a cell edge. Numerical results are presented to show the superiority of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345043","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Accurate modeling of the angular power distribution (pdf) is essential for accurate prediction of correlation. Previous studies were limited to the case of single-cluster distribution or uniform pdf. Measurements indicate that multipath often arrives in several angular clusters and with a non-uniform angular cluster pdf. We begin with the popular Salz-Winters model and extend it to the case of a multi-cluster channel and to the case of a non-uniform cluster pdf. The generic model, as well as various approximations which result in compact closed-from expressions, are studied in detail. It is shown that the correlation in a two clusters channel has an oscillatory behavior as antenna spacing increases, regardless of multipath AOA distributions; the envelope of correlation is determined by a single cluster angular spread while the oscillations within the envelope are determined by the inter-cluster angular spread. There exist two types of correlation zeros, which can be beneficially used in system design. The cluster angular pdf has negligible impact on the MIMO capacity and, hence, a simpler uniform model can be used without degradation in accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345053","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The original channel matrix [H] is decomposed into a product of a diagonal matrix [D] and a matrix [G] of RF-measurable ratios of the H matrix elements. The RF measurements help provide partial channel estimation without computational overhead to the receiver. We present two RF measurement devices and discuss their implementation and interface to a MIMO receiver. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the correlation properties of the original H matrix may be inferred from those of the G matrix thus leading to an indirect measurement of matrix channel correlation. Such information is very important for adaptive MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345088","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The channels under consideration are based on Polya's urn model (F.Alajaji et al, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.40, no.6, p.2035-2041, 1994) and can be viewed as a practical representative of channels with burst errors. The BER curves for iterative decoding with channel estimation show that random-like codes and a new class of regular and irregular codes, based on parity-check matrices of the form of block-circulants, have comparable performance for codelengths of the order of several thousands. Furthermore, the complete convergence region within the parameter space of the urn channel model is determined by using a new technique for generating side-information, termed state XORing. This technique also allows for complete characterization of the convergence region of another important bursty channel model, namely the Gilbert-Eliot scheme. Some possible applications of the results described in this paper are for designing reliable coding schemes for communication over fading or storage channels.","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

This standard, which is used extensively in Internet and image processing applications by a variety of OS platforms, has also found broad use in camera-equipped cellular phones. A limitation of the baseline standard is that, for a given set of quantization and Huffman encoding tables, the compressed size of an arbitrary image cannot be guaranteed. This can lead to problems in wireless applications where typical constraints include CPU capability, memory size and available data transfer bandwidth. Presented in this paper is a solution for overcoming these limitations 99% of the time for atypical-use cases, which takes advantage of frame-to frame similarity in a stream from a camera, and full-scale vs. subsampled image correlation for a given image.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345101","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

However, in the real propagation environment of cellular communications, it is difficult to gain the ideal ergodic capacity for time-varying fading MIMO channels except using adaptive modulation and power water-filling in the space domain over every MIMO subchannel. A novel improved rate quantization (IRQ) algorithm is proposed using water-filling theory for power allocation and adaptive modulation. The simulation results show that, with low complexity, IRQ can obtain higher transmit power utilization and greater spectral efficiency than other present rate quantization and power allocation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345191","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The model accounts for main possible propagation paths by considering them as a tube of rays, instead of a single ray. In order to validate the proposed model, two different wall scenarios have been simulated. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measurements at 37.2 GHz for perpendicular antenna polarizations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Wavelet coefficients corresponding to the points located in a neighborhood that have maximum entropy are proposed for embedding the watermark. This method embeds the maximum amount of watermark while the watermark is imperceptible. Watermarking techniques must be robust to some attacks such as smoothing, sharpening and compression. These maximum entropy areas can survive a variety of attacks and can be used as reference points for watermark embedding. The experimental results confirmed that the technique is robust to a variety of attacks.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345241","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The dual round-robin arbiter provides independent arbitration for requests on the address bus and responses on the data bus. For writeback requests that require simultaneous use of address and data lines, the arbiters for the separate buses interact in order to allow a writeback to proceed. The arbiters serve other requests until such time that they can match their separate states to serve a writeback request. It can be shown that this approach ensures a bounded waiting time and avoids the use of ad hoc approaches to temporarily increase request priority. A VHDL implementation of the arbiter design has been completed and tested in detailed logic simulation to confirm proper functionality in preparation for integration with other components in programmable logic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345244/","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8082730","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1345244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A dual round-robin arbiter for split-transaction buses in system-on-chip implementations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual round-robin arbiter for split-transaction buses in system-on-chip implementations","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01345244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051887S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9317","isNumber":"29619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9317","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"29619","articleId":"1345244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1345248,"authors":[{"name":"Leo Chan","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","Nortel Networks, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"lastName":"Leo Chan","id":"37085921687"},{"name":"Sergey Loyka","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"lastName":"Sergey Loyka","id":"37276601300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8253-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"1345248","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","Diversity methods","Transmitting antennas","Antenna accessories","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Equations","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","MIMO systems","correlation methods","direction-of-arrival estimation","electromagnetic wave scattering","radiowave propagation","Monte Carlo methods","channel capacity","statistical distributions","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath angular distribution","performance","MIMO systems","channel correlation","AOA models","scattering","physical propagation channel","closed-form expressions","Monte Carlo simulations","channel capacity","diversity gain","wireless communications","distribution shape","angular spread","continuous distribution","impulsive distribution"]}],"abstract":"The objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of multipath angular distribution on the channel correlation and performance of MIMO systems.

An adaptive two-stage predictor is proposed with the first stage containing a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to forecast multi-step-ahead traffic values at a certain timescale. The second stage combines the forecasts to produce the predicted traffic at higher timescales. Four combination schemes, averaging, RLS, MLP, and fuzzy neural network, are investigated. The performance is tested on four different types of traffic data, MPEG and JPEG video, Ethernet and Internet. The results show that the two-stage predictor outperforms the autoregressive (AR) model. The adaptive MBAC scheme uses a neural network controller to take the decision based on the congestion status and the available bandwidth computed from the multi-scale predicted traffic and the user's peak rate. The proposed scheme achieves higher network utilization compared to the peak rate and Chernoff bound schemes.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345250","startPage":"859","endPage":"862 Vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

We adopt the grid-based placement scenario that deploys exact one sensor in one grid point at most. A target in a grid point can be positioned by a set of sensors whose transmission radius covers the grid point. The optimal sensor placement for target location is to find a sensor deployment such that targets can be positioned in any grid point of the sensor fields. However, due to the cost limitation, the optimal sensor deployment cannot be achieved frequently. Consequently, the positioning accuracy is the major issue of the problem. The distance error is one of the most natural criteria to measure the positioning accuracy. In this paper, the distance error of two indistinguishable grid points is defined as the Euclidean distance between them. We formulate the sensor placement problem as a combinatorial optimization problem for minimizing the maximum distance error in the sensor field under constraints. The sensor placement problem is NP-complete for arbitrary sensor fields. We present an efficient algorithm that is based on the simulated annealing approach to address the problem. We first compare our algorithm with the brute force approach in the case of smaller sensor fields. The evidence indicates that our algorithm can find the optimal sensor placement under the minimum cost limitation. Moreover, the simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm is very superior in terms of the positioning accuracy even in the case of larger sensor fields.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345252/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8082737","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1345252/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A simulated annealing algorithm to support the sensor placement for target location","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulated annealing algorithm to support the sensor placement for target location","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01345252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048204S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9317","isNumber":"29619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9317","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"29619","articleId":"1345252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1345254,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A certain number of wavelet coefficients with large magnitudes are selected and modified by the watermark, which makes the watermark adaptive to the contents of images.

In multi-beam mobile satellite CDMA systems, the interference characteristic is quite different from terrestrial systems and it is mainly characterized by a spotbeam antenna pattern. The other-cell (or beam) interference factor, which is defined as the interference power produced by users belonging to other beams divided by the interference power produced by interfering users in the considered beam, is much more critical for satellite systems. By taking this interference feature into account, we study the system capacity for different multi-beam system designs. Another important issue in applying the CDMA scheme is the problem of unequal received mobile user power levels at a satellite. The capacity of a CDMA system is maximized in the uplink channel when all user signals are received at equal power levels to obtain the specified signal-to-noise-plus-interference power ratio. Since power control techniques cannot perfectly compensate for power fluctuations in mobile satellite channels, the capacity of the system is reduced. We show that power control error with a standard deviation in the range of 1-2 dB would cause a dramatic capacity loss in comparison to perfectly power controlled systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design issues and performance analysis of CDMA multi-beam satellites","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

In such schema, parallel detection is advantageous, since it is faster than sequential detection, it does not require power ordering at the receiver and it reduces the system latency. Previous work has proposed a parallel detector (PD) based on successive symbols approximation. Parallel detectors found in the literature suffer from high computational complexity. We first propose a modified parallel detection (MPD) algorithm that reduces the system computational complexity considerably. The algorithm can be realized using a parallel modular architecture, which consists of a set of elementary sub-detectors. The data flow between the sub-detectors is significantly reduced. The MPD also allows performance improvements when it is used as a refinement to sequential vertical Bell Labs layered space-time algorithm (V-BLAST). However, both PD and MPD algorithms do not generally perform as well as sequential V-BLAST. Thus, secondly, we suggest another parallel detection architecture. This is based on a minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion in its first stage and on weighted parallel interference cancellation in its second stage. Simulation results show that our parallel detector performs better than sequential V-BLAST for the same order of complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345325","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

STAR has already proven substantial gains over the 2D RAKE receiver (Affes, S. and Mermelstein, P., IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol.16, p.1411-22, 1998), and current technology is now sufficiently integrated to allow its cost-efficient hardware implementation. To this end, we demonstrate how the STAR algorithm can be translated to fit into a mixed FPGA/GPP (general purpose processor) architecture. We also define a data flow path, including pipelining and sequencing, which can be used to increase the number of channels that can be processed simultaneously within the system.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1345334","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

We propose two adaptive SISO parallel decision feedback detectors based on the normalized least mean square and recursive least squares algorithms for both synchronous and asynchronous CDMA systems, respectively. Compared with traditional non-SISO adaptive detectors, our SISO adaptive detectors effectively exploit the a priori information about coded symbols, which is based on soft inputs from a bank of single user decoders, to further improve their convergence performance. Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented and compared.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

This methodology is applied to a 65nm technology that supports a high-density (<0.5 um/sup 2/) embedded 6T SRAM cell. High performance logic (I/sub dn//I/sub dp/ = 550/300uA/um at L/sub poly/ = 39nm) and low leakage are achieved simultaneously by employing a data retention mode for the SRAM (I/sub leakage/ /spl sim/2pA/bit). Retention mode bias conditions and selective gate sizing in the SRAM reduces leakage by /spl sim/300X. Advanced transistor design including SSR channel, strain engineering, drain-extension (HDD) offset spacer, and HDD and halo profile optimization is used to achieve at least an additional 4/spl times/ reduction in leakage.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345365","publicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9327/29638/01345365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29638","startPage":"14","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transistor optimization for leakage power management in a 65 nm CMOS technology for wireless and mobile applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1345365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transistor optimization for leakage power management in a 65 nm CMOS technology for wireless and mobile applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345365/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2004","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8048232","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1345365/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transistor optimization for leakage power management in a 65 nm CMOS technology for wireless and mobile applications","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01345365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111262S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9327","isNumber":"29638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9327","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"29638","articleId":"1345365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1345368,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Additionally, our results also show the feasibility of 256Mb nonvolatile PRAM with writing time below 100ns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345369/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1345369/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8048234","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2004","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Full integration and cell characteristics for 64Mb nonvolatile PRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full integration and cell characteristics for 64Mb nonvolatile PRAM","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01345369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061611S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9327","isNumber":"29638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9327","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"29638","articleId":"1345369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1345370,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Various kinds of MTJ sizes and shapes have been evaluated and conclude that in ellipse like shape pattern aspect ratio more than 2 is enough for reproducing and reliable switching characteristics. As regards the reading characteristics, the combination of the optimized MTJ pattern and process makes 21.4 sigma separation between high and low resistance states. In further study of the relation between MTJ shapes and switching distribution, we found a \"Saturn\" shaped MTJ has best switching behavior. Also the toggle mode MRAM is evaluated and its effectiveness for high speed programming is confirmed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Paper technology","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage","CMOS integrated circuits","magnetic tunnelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["0.18 /spl mu/m high-density MRAM","switching dispersion","Magnetic Tunnel Junction","ellipse like shape pattern aspect ratio","0.18 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1345370","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345370","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9327/29638/01345370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345370","startPage":"22","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29638","publicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study for 0.18 /spl mu/m high-density MRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study for 0.18 /spl mu/m high-density MRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345370/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2004","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2004","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1345370/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8048235","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study for 0.18 /spl mu/m high-density MRAM","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01345370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071545S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9327","isNumber":"29638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9327","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"29638","articleId":"1345370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1345371,"authors":[{"name":"Y.K.

These novel processes drastically improved electrical characteristics such as cell capacitance, parasitic bit line capacitance and cell contact resistance, compared to a conventional process. The most pronounced effect using the LERI in COB structure is to greatly improve cell capacitance without twin bit failure. In addition, the TSC technology has an ability to remove a critical ArF lithography. By using the LERI and TSC processes in 82nm 512M DDR DRAM, the cell capacitance of 32fF/cell is achieved with Toxeq of 2.3nm and the parasitic bit line capacitance is reduced by 20%, resulted in great improvement of tRCD (1.5ns).","publicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9327/29638/01345377.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel robust cell capacitor (Leaning Exterminated Ring type Insulator) and new storage node contact (Top Spacer Contract) for 70nm DRAM technology and beyond","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1345377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2004","displayDocTitle":"Novel robust cell capacitor (Leaning Exterminated Ring type Insulator) and new storage node contact (Top Spacer Contract) for 70nm DRAM technology and beyond","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8058192","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1345377/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel robust cell capacitor (Leaning Exterminated Ring type Insulator) and new storage node contact (Top Spacer Contract) for 70nm DRAM technology and beyond","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01345377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063028S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9327","isNumber":"29638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9327","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"29638","articleId":"1345377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1345387,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This result shows the good scalability of this technology.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345404","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","startPage":"80","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9327/29638/01345404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel MNOS technology using gate hole injection in erase operation for embedded nonvolatile memory applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","MONOS devices","Scalability","Voltage","Electrodes","Silicon compounds","Degradation","Circuits","Character generation","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISFET","semiconductor storage","interface states","nanotechnology","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MNOS technology","gate hole injection","erase operation","embedded nonvolatile memory applications","erasing speed","localized interface trap","source side region","10 ms","10 mus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel MNOS technology using gate hole injection in erase operation for embedded nonvolatile memory applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8058211","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1345404/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345404/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel MNOS technology using gate hole injection in erase operation for embedded nonvolatile memory applications","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01345404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089173S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9327","isNumber":"29638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9327","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"29638","articleId":"1345404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1345414,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Gu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Qun Gu","id":"38257724000"},{"name":"Zhiwei Xu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhiwei Xu","id":"37273450100"},{"name":"Jongsun Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jongsun Kim","id":"37281190200"},{"name":"Jenwei Ko","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jenwei Ko","id":"37274947000"},{"name":"M.F.

For the first time we report low damage CVD processes for achieving dual workfunction metal gates in contrast to most reports in literature. Excellent hole mobility has been obtained for aggressive stacks. It is further observed that electron mobility optimization is critically dependent on specific electrode and interface layer combinations along with post deposition processing even for nominally identical HfO/sub 2/ layers.","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology,

Most of the vertical MOSFET structures proposed so far, however, require sophisticated processing which is incompatible with conventional CMOS processes. In this paper, we propose the use of a vertical poly-Si pMOSFET for SoC applications; this structure is easily stacked on bulk nMOS, eliminating the need for an n-well region and significantly reducing chip Size. The formation of poly-Si grain boundaries across the active channels of poly-Si MOSFETs means that these devices tend to exhibit poor performance in the form of large threshold-voltage fluctuations and large subthreshold swings. A vertical poly-Si transistor that operates with a partially depleted SOI structure and shows excellent DC characteristics has been developed as a solution to these problems. The impact of this new vertical pMOS structure on 6T-SRAM is also demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new vertically stacked poly-Si MOSFET with partially depleted SOI operation for densely integrated SoC applications","publicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345498","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9327/29638/01345498.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2004.1345498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1345498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1345498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2004","displayDocTitle":"A new vertically stacked poly-Si MOSFET with partially depleted SOI operation for densely integrated SoC applications","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1345498/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8058272","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new vertically stacked poly-Si MOSFET with partially depleted SOI operation for densely integrated SoC applications","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01345498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060025S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9327","isNumber":"29638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9327","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"29638","articleId":"1345498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1345501,"authors":[{"name":"Chankwang Park","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Chankwang Park","id":"37277792100"},{"name":"Sangpil Sim","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Sangpil Sim","id":"37266177400"},{"name":"Jungin Han","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Jungin Han","id":"37276629700"},{"name":"Chul Jeong","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Chul Jeong","id":"37268287400"},{"name":"Younggoan Jang","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Younggoan Jang","id":"37278065500"},{"name":"Junghwan Park","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Junghwan Park","id":"37616524300"},{"name":"Jaehoon Kim","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Jaehoon Kim","id":"37281210800"},{"name":"Kyucharn Park","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Kyucharn Park","id":"38184534600"},{"name":"Kinam Kim","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Youngin-City, Gyunggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Kinam Kim","id":"37280248100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8289-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1345501","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space technology","Flash memory","Synthetic aperture sonar","Nonvolatile memory","Parasitic capacitance","Doping profiles","Consumer electronics","Mobile handsets","Manufacturing processes","Pulp manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NOR circuits","flash memories","nanolithography","ultraviolet lithography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["70nm NOR flash technology","cell size","high density memory","mobile application","Self-Aligned Poly structure","top corner rounding trench structure","cell transistor","gate length","70 nm"]}],"abstract":"A 70nm NOR flash technology has been for the first time developed with a cell size of 0.0494m, which is the smallest size of NOR flash cell, for high density memory of mobile application.

The system can overcome the decrease of spectrum efficiency and energy of conventional MC-CDMA due to inserting cyclic prefix (CP); and make full use of the turbo codes' good capacity against fading channel to improve the BER performance further. Theoretical analysis and simulation results all show that the proposed system outperforms conventional MC-CDMA system, and its performance is superior to that of the conventional MC-CDMA with CP.

However, time variations of the channel within an OFDM symbol leads to a loss of orthogonality between subcarriers, resulting in interchannel interference (ICI). This paper presents the effect of time and frequency selectivity on the performance of OFDM when the total bandwidth increases while the subcarrier bandwidth remains constant. It shows that a maximum bandwidth exists with the use of a frequency domain equalizer assuming the channel path gains at the beginning of each OFDM symbol are known, and further increasing the bandwidth beyond this point will not ensure the guaranteed performance. The performance variation as the total bandwidth increases when coding is used is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

A serially concatenated iterative scheme (BPCM-ID) combining low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) with multilevel modulation is proposed. Differing from other serially concatenated iterative decoding schemes, the whole iterative process of BPCM-ID is divided into outer iteration and inner iteration to avoid too much error feedback to the demapper which may cause severe degradation of decoding performance. It helps to improve the robustness of the system. Another advantage, in contrast to using convolutional codes or turbo codes, is its low complexity while maintaining high BER performance because the check equations are used to terminate the both iterations. We also study the different mapping constellations for 16-QAM. Simulations show that BPCM-ID can achieve not only large coded gains but also diversity with robust convergence performance and low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1345942","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

A novel reduced-order multistage PIC multiuser detection method based on mean field annealing in an asynchronous multipath CDMA system is presented in this paper to solve the problem that the conventional optimal multiuser detection methods have the characteristics of larger calculation and slower convergence. This method employs mean field annealing technique, and then the NP-complete problem of minimizing the objective function of the optimal multiuser detection can be translated into minimizing a mean field annealing network energy function. This method uses the block Toeplitz characteristics of matrix, and then larger matrix can be replaced by small matrix, which leads to reduced order and calculation effectively. Theory and experimental results reveal that this method has the better performance to cancel MAI, suppress inter-symbol interference and multipath fading, and this method has small calculation so it can be implemented in real-time. Finally the reduced-order multistage PIC multiuser detection method based on mean field annealing given in this paper is a better scheme for asynchronous multipath CDMA systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1345944","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The design facilitates collision resolution by embedding the address information of both the transmitter and receiver in the coding scheme so that the receiver can identify the packet addressing to it without actually decoding the information symbol bits. In addition, the present scheme also avoids transmitter retransmissions and receivers wasting time in receiving a packet to completion if the packet is not addressed to it which causes additional battery energy consumption. A bank of matched filters is used to identify intended receivers, although any multiuser detection algorithm can easily be applied. The performance of the proposed coding scheme is studied by investigating its rate of missing receiver detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1345969","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

However, since it does not make full use of the diversity provided by multiple antennas, its performance is much poorer than other space-time coding approaches. A new application of DS-CDMA in BLAST is proposed; it introduces orthogonal spreading sequences (OSS) into the transmitter while it retains the basic structure of BLAST. The proposed receiver suppresses interference from other antennas by the orthogonality contained in the received signals, and extracts information from each receive antenna using the RAKE receiver principle to construct an efficient statistical decision. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves good performance over flat fading channels at the cost of a little loss in spreading spectrum.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new application of DS-CDMA in BLAST systems","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

By optimizing the BST algorithm through optimally ordering and adapting detection to channel matrix conditions, computational complexity and storage complexity are further reduced. An upper bound for the average computational complexity of the BST algorithm is derived analytically and it is shown that, for a fixed channel matrix, the upper-bound of the average computational complexity of the ML stack algorithm decreases exponentially as SNR increases.

MIMO systems typically fall into two categories: spatial multiplexing systems (SM-systems) and space-time coding systems (STC-systems). Compared with each other, the SM-systems give the higher data rates while the STC-systems give the better performance. Joint detection (JD) techniques, as one class of multiuser detection, were originally used in CDMA systems to combat multiple-access and intersymbol interference. A novel method of combining coding and JD techniques for signal detection in MIMO systems is proposed. Compared with SM-systems, such as VBLAST, this method can attain better performance. Compared with common STC-systems, this method can achieve the full code rates even for more than two transmit antennas with complex constellations. The performances of the approaches using different JD algorithms are analyzed and compared.

Both the methods combine BF, space-time block coding (STBC) and selection transmit diversity (STD), but the first one uses diversity arrays while the second one uses beamforming arrays for downlink transmission. By simulation, the complexities of the two methods are compared with respect to antenna configuration and information feedback, and their improved performances over the original STBC scheme are investigated in detail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1346009/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"8088709","publicationDate":"2004","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1346009/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint beamforming and transmit diversity for wireless communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint beamforming and transmit diversity for wireless communications","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"01346009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066311S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9319","isNumber":"29624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9319","xplore-issue":"29624","articleId":"1346009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1346018,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuli Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xiuli Zhou","id":"37280488100"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yu Hu","id":"37277446200"},{"name":"Qinggui Tan","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Qinggui Tan","id":"37270539400"},{"name":"Zhoushi Yao","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhoushi Yao","id":"37272834500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8647-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1346018","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","High speed optical techniques","Optical variables control","Optical attenuators","Optical fiber communication","Optical fibers","Stimulated emission","Interference","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","optical communication","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters","satellite links","space communication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous OCDMA","code-division multiple access","optical CDMA","intersatellite communication","intersatellite optical communication","transmitter","channel capacity","receiver","discrete memoryless channel","noiseless capacity limit"]}],"abstract":"OCDMA (optical code-division multiple access) technology applied in intersatellite optical communications is novel.

The method proposed is based on the fact that the different channels can be effectively characterized by a CDMA receiver. Therefore, when we are hopping the signal transmission over different channels, this hopping information, i.e. the way of hopping, can be identified by the receiver. In the proposed system, the independent channels are used for signal mapping in such a way that transmission of an information symbol over a specified channel represents a specified channel bit value. The total bits of a symbol are the summation of the bits of the symbol itself and the channel bits. The theoretical analysis shows that the capacity gain of the channel hopping technique is the same as that of transmit diversity over the \"flat\" channel. However, for a DS-CDMA system under the assumption that the multiuser interference obeys a Gaussian distribution, the proposed system has larger system capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A channel hopping technique I: theoretical studies on band efficiency and capacity","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The paper investigates the impact of array orientation on both spatial correlation and the capacity of MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) wireless channels. It is found that the impact cannot be neglected if angular spread is small, and that an antenna array should be rotated to make the array's normal point to the mean direction of arrival or departure (DOA or DOD) to attain more capacity. Numerical results verify the impact on spatial correlation, which increases with the array's normal deviating from the mean DOA or DOD. Simulation results show that the orientation of the array dominates the impact on MIMO channel capacity under small angular spread, and that increasing the angular spread diminishes the impact, or even eliminates it.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1346048","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The information of the detected subchannels is used to decide whether or not to insert new pilots in the corresponding subchannels. Then we obtain the LS equalizer, and get the MMSE solution.

The common compensation method can only correct common phase error (CPE) caused by the low-frequency part of the phase-noise spectrum, and cannot compensate phase noise thoroughly. A new method, per-symbol phase noise detection and compensation method, is proposed. Based on a frequency-domain linearized parametric model for phase noise, the method not only deals with CPE more effectively, but also compensates most of the intercarrier interference (ICI) induced by the high-frequency part of the phase-noise spectrum. This method well compensates phase noise in higher SNRs and lower quality tuners.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1346074","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The tracking algorithm is analyzed carefully, and it is found that not only noise, but other three factors - channel estimate errors, carrier number and modulation schemes - also affect the estimate result and tracking range. Moreover, carrier number and modulation schemes are the dominant factors. This estimator has the advantage of high accuracy even on low Eb/N0 conditions, but its implementation is relatively simple.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1346076","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The time variations of the channel during one OFDM frame destroy the orthogonality of the different subcarriers and generate power leakage among the subcarriers, known as intercarrier interference (ICI). A novel and suitable channel model for OFDM is introduced and serves as the basis for the derivation of the ICI. The bivariate probability density function (PDF) of the ICI is shown to be a weighted Gaussian mixture. A two-dimensional Gram-Charlier representation for the bivariate probability density of the ICI is established; it is shown that its truncated version, of order 4,6, provides a very good approximation. Finally, the degradation in the performance of OFDM resulting from Doppler effects caused by a time-varying, frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel is obtained by averaging the approximated ICI statistics over the fading channel statistics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance degradation of OFDM system over time-varying fading channel","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

A piconet consists of a master and up to seven slaves. Devices that desire to receive data from the same source construct a multicast group, sharing multicast communication services. A piconet may consist of member and non-member devices of a multicast group, causing non-member devices to consume power to overhear the multicast message. For those members that belong to different piconets, a multi-hop communication path is required, hence increasing the delay time of a multicast service and causing more non-member devices to participate in the multicast tree. The paper develops a power-aware multicast protocol (PAMP) for constructing an efficient multicast tree. By collecting members into the same piconet, the constructed multicast tree has characteristics of fewest non-member devices, smallest tree level, and proper role assignments to members. Experimental results show that PAMP provides an efficient multicast service with low power consumption and small delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1346102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1346102/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8088744","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"PAMP: a power-aware multicast protocol for Bluetooth radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAMP: a power-aware multicast protocol for Bluetooth radio systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"01346102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048359S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9319","isNumber":"29624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9319","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"29624","articleId":"1346102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1346105,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Information Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jian Song","id":"37277430000"},{"name":"Yuan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Information Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yuan Chen","id":"37281023300"},{"name":"Lemin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Information Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Lemin Li","id":"37280693400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8647-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1346105","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"abstract":"We propose a simple fair scheduling algorithm for wireless networks.

The MMB scheduler switches packets between DCHs of different rates based on the traffic volume measurement of their corresponding serving DCH buffers. The algorithm performance is evaluated by detailed system simulations in terms of average packet throughput. Numerical results reveal that the presented algorithm shows consistent performance for different traffic sources and. various DCH combinations. Furthermore, optimal algorithm performances under the various conditions studied are achieved with almost the same algorithm parameter settings.

The quadratic constraint is added to the weighted least squared error between the desired and the actual beam patterns over a small region near the array steering direction, which makes the array less sensitive to steering vector errors and nonstationary data snapshots. Thus, robustness is achieved.

Since the DS-SS signal uses a large bandwidth, the power spectral density can be below the noise level. Hence, such a signal is difficult to detect. We propose a detection method based on fourth-order cumulant 2D slice for a DS-SS/BPSK signal far below the noise level. It does not require a priori knowledge about the signal, and can estimate the carrier frequency and the symbol period simultaneously. The validity of this method, even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, has been shown by computer simulation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Binary phase shift keying","Noise level","Frequency estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Spread spectrum communication","Counting circuits","Jamming","Bandwidth","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order statistics","frequency estimation","parameter estimation","spread spectrum communication","phase shift keying","military communication","jamming","signal detection","random noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple parameter estimation","DS-SS/BPSK signal","fourth-order cumulant 2D slice","direct sequence spread spectrum signals","military systems","jamming","signal interception probability","signal detection probability","power spectral density","a priori knowledge","carrier frequency estimation","symbol period estimation","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1346318","startPage":"867","endPage":"870 Vol.2","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The paper proposes an AR technique as an alternative tool for this purpose, due to its improved coding region resolution for small data records. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the detection resolution for the AR technique is higher than that of Fourier methods for small DNA sequences. The sequence length and structure are the main factors that affect performance of any detection method. However, AR methods are more robust against variations in these factors. Unlike neural net-based methods, no a priori knowledge of the sequences is required. Hence, the AR technique appears to be a useful tool for 3-periodicity (including other periodicities), repeat and regulatory regions of unknown genomic sequences, especially small genomic sequence.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1346354","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

An analysis of the two main characters of quantum computing and chaos is also presented. This algorithm demonstrates the convergence of the quantum genetic algorithm (QGA).

Functional models and Matlab code have been developed to simulate a transceiver system for both structures. A pulse amplitude modulated four-level (4-PAM) signaling technique is used in the Matlab simulation. Results show that the proposed parallel adaptation engine is four times faster than the published round-robin adaptation engine in terms of coefficient update rate with comparable hardware. Both circuits prove that digital CMOSP18 standard cells can be used directly to achieve 625 MHz timing constraints. A custom circuit is not needed to implement the digital adaptation algorithm for the analog adaptive pre-emphasis up to 625 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1346443","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The adaptive Viterbi algorithm, which adaptively computes the survivor path according to the channel environment, reduces the computation of complexity and correspondingly power consumption greatly. In this paper, the authors present a novel VLSI architecture for the add-compare-select (ACS) unit, which is the key component of the adaptive Viterbi decoder. In the proposed scheme, the compare unit is simplified from the variable based to constant based by employing a simple transform to the adaptive Viterbi algorithm. Based on the simplicity of the constant comparison circuit, we develop a parallel approach to select N/sub max/ paths out of 2N/sub max/ possible paths. The proposed transformed architecture eliminates the need for path metric storage unit and reduces the complexity of the comparison operation. The proposed ACS architecture achieves 57 %, 47 % and 7 % improvement in power, area and speed respectively compared to the conventional approach. Moreover, there is a 25 % to 47 % storage reduction in the path metric unit (PMU).","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The memory cell (MC) using a single transistor on SOI exploits the Floating Body (FB) effect of partially depleted (PD) SOI devices. The memory state can be read through the drain current of the storage transistors, i.e. I/sub 0/ and I/sub 1/ respectively. To read the information stored in a 1T DRAM cell, the current of the selected MC is compared to I/sub ref/ . In this paper, we propose a sensing method with automatic reference generation for SOI capacitor-less 1T DRAM.

Firstly, Dual Asymmetric bit line Sensing Scheme is proposed to implement VDD bit line pre-charge scheme without any reference cells and half charge generator. Therefore, we overcame the risk of failure caused by defects in reference cells and simplified embodying VDD bit line pre-charge scheme, enjoying privileges of VDD bit line pre-charge scheme such as fast sensing speed (tRC:7ns, tAC:6.7ns in this work) and stable sensing operation at low voltage and low temperature. Secondly, we propose circuit idea for quiet unselected IO lines. Unselected IO lines are not developed by bit line data during READ/WRITE operation. This scheme has advantage in the architecture with wide IO and various IO multiplexing options like a memory compiler.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2004.1346554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2004.1346554","startPage":"190","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"2004 Symposium on VLSI Circuits.

Interestingly, with only minor modification the same hardware needed to implement a 4PAM system can be used to implement a loop-unrolled single-tap DFE receiver. To get the maximum performance from either technique, the link has to be tuned to match the specific channel it is driving. Adaptive equalization using data based update filtering allows continuous updates while minimizing the required sampler front-end hardware and significantly reduces the cost of implementation in multi-level signaling schemes. A transceiver chip was designed and fabricated in 0.13 /spl mu/m CMOS process to investigate dual-mode operation and the modifications of the standard adaptive algorithms necessary to operate in high-speed link environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive equalization and data recovery in a dual-mode (PAM2/4) serial link transceiver","publicationTitle":"2004 Symposium on VLSI Circuits.

In order to find a better solution between SoC and SoP, and eliminate constraints between chip and package, a complete solution is needed to co-design and co-optimize chip and package in a total design plan with precise trade-offs of on-chip versus off-chip passives. In this paper, we present a complete and systematic design methodology for RF SoP/SoC. This methodology includes early analysis and design implementation. This early analysis is to estimate the performance and cost of each solution quickly and quantitatively. Then, the best solution is found and implemented. For a better presentation, the method and design techniques are demonstrated through the design of a common emitter low noise amplifier (LNA) for 5GHz wireless LAN (local area network). Analytical equations of noise figure and transducer gain for the LNA with lossy package are also developed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPD.2004.1346682","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE CPMT Conference on High Density Microsystem Design and Packaging and Component Failure Analysis (HDP '04)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE CPMT Conference on High Density Microsystem Design and Packaging and Component Failure Analysis (HDP '04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9340/29654/01346682.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","doi":"10.1109/HPD.2004.1346682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip versus off-chip passives analysis in radio and mixed-signal system-on-package design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 June-3 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"On-chip versus off-chip passives analysis in radio and mixed-signal system-on-package design","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-3 July 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1346682/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8109403","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1346682/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip versus off-chip passives analysis in radio and mixed-signal system-on-package design","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01346682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069667S","chronDate":"30 June-3 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9340","isNumber":"29654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9340","xplore-issue":"29654","articleId":"1346682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1346736,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Laijin","affiliation":["The Microelectronics Research and Developing Center, Shanghai University, China"],"lastName":"Yan Laijin","id":"37283648800"},{"name":"Li Ming","affiliation":["The Microelectronics Research and Developing Center, Shanghai University, China"],"lastName":"Li Ming","id":"37067615300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8620-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1346736","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Error correction","Delay","Reed-Solomon codes","Polynomials","Hardware design languages","Throughput","Block codes","Galois fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","field programmable gate arrays","data communication equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","RS(255,223) decoder","high-speed data communication","Euclidean algorithm","Chien search","Forney algorithm","parallel processing technology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1346736","abstract":"This paper proposes a RS(255,223) decoder for applications that require high-speed data communication and reliability.

The method is shifted difference coefficient method where the differences are selected using a minimum spanning tree. By finding a minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph, corresponding to the coefficients, an implementation of a multiple constant multiplication block with low arithmetic complexity is obtained. There are algorithms that find a minimum spanning tree in polynomial time, making the proposed method computational efficient. We also propose that the differences are computed on odd coefficients only. This reduces the number of adders in an implementation further, compared to other difference coefficient methods. Several stages of differences, i.e., a set of differences is used to compute a new set of higher order differences, may also be used. We show that the proposed method give optimal, or close to optimal, results with respect to the number of additions required for a number of FIR filter implementations.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2004.1346826","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference (IEEE Cat.

Thus mobile operators need to build many BS sites to achieve this goal. However, this implementation will definitely increase the total network investment and take much longer in \"off-air\" time. Furthermore, in some areas where the mobile traffic is low, or areas that experience abnormal attenuation to radio frequency (RF), building new BS sites is not justified. Alternatively, broadband cellular repeaters, which transmit and receive the same RF signal simultaneously, can be used to provide reliable radio coverage in these areas.

We describe a hardware-based Gaussian noise generator used as a key component in a hardware simulation system, for exploring channel code behavior at very low bit error rates (BERs) in the range of 10/sup -9/ to 10/sup -10/. The main novelty is the design and use of nonuniform piecewise linear approximations in computing trigonometric and logarithmic functions. The parameters of the approximation are chosen carefully to enable rapid computation of coefficients from the inputs while still retaining high fidelity to the modeled functions. The output of the noise generator accurately models a true Gaussian Probability Density Function (PDF) even at very high /spl sigma/ values. Its properties are explored using: 1) several different statistical tests, including the chi-square test and the Anderson-Darling test, and 2) an application for decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. An implementation at 133 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-II XC2V4000-6 FPGA produces 133 million samples per second, which is seven times faster than a 2.6 GHz Pentium-IV PC; another implementation on a Xilinx Spartan-IIE XC2S300E-7 FPGA at 62 MHz is capable of a three times speedup. The performance can be improved by exploiting parallelism: an XC2V4000-6 FPGA with nine parallel instances of the noise generator at 105 MHz can run 50 times faster than a 2.6 GHz Pentium-IV PC. We illustrate the deterioration of clock speed with the increase in the number of instances.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian noise","Programmable logic arrays","Piecewise linear approximation","Error analysis","Noise generators","Random number generation","Virtual computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","statistical testing","field programmable gate arrays","parity check codes","piecewise linear techniques","error statistics","noise generators","random number generation","performance evaluation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise generator","hardware-based simulation","bit error rates","nonuniformn piecewise linear approximation","Gaussian Probability Density Function","statistical testing","low-density parity-check code","Xilinx Virtex-II XC2V4000-6 FPGA","Pentium-IV PC","Xilinx Spartan-IIE XC2S300E-7 FPGA","XC2V4000-6 FPGA","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Algorithms implemented in hardware","error-checking","gate arrays","simulation."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347079","doi":"10.1109/TC.2004.106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/29661/01347079.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2004.106","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Gaussian noise generator for hardware-based simulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Gaussian noise generator for hardware-based simulations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347079/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1347079/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8208899","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Gaussian noise generator for hardware-based simulations","sourcePdf":"01347079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113698S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"29661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"29661","articleId":"1347079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1347086,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

However, the PF table update poses significant challenges for efficient use of TCAM. To avoid erroneous and inconsistent rule matching, the traditional approach is to lock the PF table during the rule update period, but table locking has a negative impact on data path processing. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called Consistent Policy Table Update Algorithm (CoPTUA), for TCAM. Instead of minimizing the number of rule moves to reduce the locking time, CoPTUA maintains a consistent PF table throughout the update process, thus eliminating the need for locking the PF table while-ensuring correctness of rule matching. Our analysis and simulation show that, even for a PF table with 100,000 rules, an arbitrary number of rules can be updated simultaneously within 1 second in the worst case, provided that 2 percent of the PF table entries are empty. Thus, CoPTUA enforces any new rule in less than 1 second for practical PF table size with high memory utilization and without impacting data path processing.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2004.108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/29661/01347086.pdf","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2004.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CoPTUA: Consistent Policy Table Update Algorithm for TCAM without locking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347086/","displayDocTitle":"CoPTUA: Consistent Policy Table Update Algorithm for TCAM without locking","volume":"53","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8208906","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1347086/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CoPTUA: Consistent Policy Table Update Algorithm for TCAM without locking","sourcePdf":"01347086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064106S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"29661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"29661","articleId":"1347086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1347095,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The BNs are chosen from currently active mobile backbone-capable nodes or are represented by (ground and/or airborne) unmanned vehicles (UVs) that are guided into selected positions. We develop and investigate a new joint power controlled medium access control (MAC) algorithm for wireless access nets (ANets). Under our new protocol, the net backbone node instructs the ANet nodes to make power control adjustments while simultaneously allocating to them slots for the requested transmissions of their packets. This algorithm, in contrast to other employed conventional graph-based scheduling algorithms, satisfies the requirement that a minimum signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) is met at all intended receivers. We show our algorithm to lead to a significant increase in the net throughput level by attaining high spatial reuse.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","volume":"3","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"8211581","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1347095/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple access protocol for power-controlled wireless access nets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple access protocol for power-controlled wireless access nets","sourcePdf":"01347095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078535S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"29662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"29662","articleId":"1347095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1347098,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We focus on maximizing rates under battery-lifetime and power constraints. Commonly used metrics are total capacity (in the case of cellular networks) and transport capacity (in the case of ad hoc networks). However, it is known in traditional wired networking that maximizing total capacity conflicts with fairness, and this is why fairness-oriented rate allocations, such as max-min fairness, are often used. We review this issue for wireless ad hoc networks. Indeed, the mathematical model for wireless networks has a specificity that makes some of the findings different. It has been reported in the literature on ultra wide band that gross unfairness occurs when maximizing total capacity or transport capacity, and we confirm by a theoretical analysis that this is a fundamental shortcoming of these metrics in wireless ad hoc networks, as it is for wired networks. The story is different for max-min fairness. Although it is perfectly viable for a wired network, it is much less so in our setting. We show that, in the limit of long battery lifetimes, the max-min allocation of rates always leads to strictly equal rates, regardless of the MAC layer, network topology, channel variations, or choice of routes and power constraints. This is due to the \"solidarity\" property of the set of feasible rates. This results in all flows receiving the rate of the worst flow, and leads to severe inefficiency. We show numerically that the problem persists when battery-lifetime constraints are finite. This generalizes the observation reported in the literature that, in heterogeneous settings, 802.11 allocates the worst rate to all stations, and shows that this is inherent to any protocol that implements max-min fairness. Utility fairness is an alternative to max-min fairness, which approximates rate allocation performed by TCP in the Internet. We analyze by numerical simulations different utility functions and we show that the proportional fairness of rates or transport rates, a particular instance of utility-based metrics, is robust and achieves a good tradeoff between efficiency and fairness, unlike total rate or maximum fairness. We thus recommend that metrics for the rate performance of mobile ad hoc networking protocols be based on proportional fairness.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2004.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29662","startPage":"334","endPage":"349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/29662/01347098.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate performance objectives of multihop wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1347098/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rate performance objectives of multihop wireless networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8211583","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate performance objectives of multihop wireless networks","sourcePdf":"01347098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096192S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"29662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"29662","articleId":"1347098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1347099,"authors":[{"name":"K.

MIMO links provide extremely high spectral efficiencies in multipath channels by simultaneously transmitting multiple independent data streams in the same channel. MAC protocols have been proposed in related work for ad hoc networks with other classes of smart antennas such as switched beam antennas. However, as we substantiate in the paper, the unique characteristics of MIMO links coupled with several key optimization considerations, necessitate an entirely new MAC protocol. We identify several advantages of MIMO links, and discuss key optimization considerations that can help in realizing an effective MAC protocol for such an environment. We present a centralized algorithm called stream-controlled medium access (SCMA) that has the key optimization considerations incorporated in its design. Finally, we present a distributed SCMA protocol that approximates the centralized algorithm and compare its performance against that of baseline protocols that are CSMA/CA variants.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2004.42","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/29662/01347099.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2004.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29662","startPage":"350","endPage":"365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medium access control in ad hoc networks with MIMO links: optimization considerations and algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Medium access control in ad hoc networks with MIMO links: optimization considerations and algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8211584","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1347099/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium access control in ad hoc networks with MIMO links: optimization considerations and algorithms","sourcePdf":"01347099.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07647S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"29662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"29662","articleId":"1347099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1347100,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Clustering sensor nodes is an effective topology control approach. We propose a novel distributed clustering approach for long-lived ad hoc sensor networks. Our proposed approach does not make any assumptions about the presence of infrastructure or about node capabilities, other than the availability of multiple power levels in sensor nodes. We present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of the node residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED terminates in O(1) iterations, incurs low message overhead, and achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. We prove that, with appropriate bounds on node density and intracluster and intercluster transmission ranges, HEED can asymptotically almost surely guarantee connectivity of clustered networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting scalable data aggregation.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2004.41","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/29662/01347100.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2004.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HEED: a hybrid, energy-efficient, distributed clustering approach for ad hoc sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347100/","displayDocTitle":"HEED: a hybrid, energy-efficient, distributed clustering approach for ad hoc sensor networks","volume":"3","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1347100/","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8211585","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HEED: a hybrid, energy-efficient, distributed clustering approach for ad hoc sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01347100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075605S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"29662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"3002","xplore-issue":"29662","articleId":"1347100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1347118,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Any deviation from this PRF will result in a nonuniform sampling of the synthetic aperture.

In this paper, we focus on addressing this issue by developing a number of test problems and by suggesting a baseline algorithm. Since in a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem, the resulting Pareto-optimal set is expected to change with time (or, iteration of the optimization process), a suite of five test problems offering different patterns of such changes and different difficulties in tracking the dynamic Pareto-optimal front by a multiobjective optimization algorithm is presented. Moreover, a simple example of a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem arising from a dynamic control loop is presented. An extension to a previously proposed direction-based search method is proposed for solving such problems and tested on the proposed test problems.

However, often an objective function possesses numerous local optima, which could trap an algorithm from moving toward the desired global solution. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged to enable global optimization; however, at the present stage, EAs are basically limited to solving small-scale problems due to the constraint of computational efficiency. To improve the search efficiency, this paper presents a stochastic genetic algorithm (StGA). A novel stochastic coding strategy is employed so that the search space is dynamically divided into regions using a stochastic method and explored region-by-region. In each region, a number of children are produced through random sampling, and the best child is chosen to represent the region. The variance values are decreased if at least one of five generated children results in improved fitness, otherwise, the variance values are increased. Experiments on 20 test functions of diverse complexities show that the StGA is able to find the near-optimal solution in all cases. Compared with several other algorithms, StGA achieves not only an improved accuracy, but also a considerable reduction of the computational effort. On average, the computational cost required by StGA is about one order less than the other algorithms. The StGA is also shown to be able to solve large-scale problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8154368","volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1347160/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A robust stochastic genetic algorithm (StGA) for global numerical optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust stochastic genetic algorithm (StGA) for global numerical optimization","sourcePdf":"01347160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073373S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"29665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"29665","articleId":"1347160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1347162,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

Our approach is to estimate the objective function value of an offspring by fitting a function approximation model over the k nearest previously evaluated points, where k=(d+1)(d+2)/2 and d is the dimension of the problem. The estimated function values are used to screen offspring to identify the most promising ones for function evaluation. To fit function approximation models, a symmetric Latin hypercube design (SLHD) is used to determine initial points for function evaluation. We compared the performance of an evolution strategy (ES) with local quadratic approximation, an ES with local cubic radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, an ES whose initial parent population comes from an SLHD, and a conventional ES. These algorithms were applied to a twelve-dimensional (12-D) groundwater bioremediation problem involving a complex nonlinear finite-element simulation model. The performances of these algorithms were also compared on the Dixon-Szego test functions and on the ten-dimensional (10-D) Rastrigin and Ackley test functions. All comparisons involve analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the computation of simultaneous confidence intervals. The results indicate that ES algorithms with local approximation were significantly better than conventional ES algorithms and ES algorithms initialized by SLHDs on all Dixon-Szego test functions except for Goldstein-Price. However, for the more difficult 10-D and 12-D functions, only the cubic RBF approach was successful in improving the performance of an ES. Moreover, the results also suggest that the cubic RBF approach is superior to the quadratic approximation approach on all test functions and the difference in performance is statistically significant for all test functions with dimension d/spl ges/4.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2004.835247","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/29665/01347162.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2004.835247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"490","endPage":"505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local function approximation in evolutionary algorithms for the optimization of costly functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Local function approximation in evolutionary algorithms for the optimization of costly functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347162/","volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1347162/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8154370","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local function approximation in evolutionary algorithms for the optimization of costly functions","sourcePdf":"01347162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098145S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"29665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"29665","articleId":"1347162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":1347170,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.G.

A simplified power distribution system is modeled using ideas similar to field oriented control of three phase ac machines. Zero dynamics of the system show that the system is nonminimum phase for certain operating conditions, thus, imposing restrictions on the achievable dynamic response. The control design involves estimation of the load conductance via a gradient-based estimator, and state feedback control to reach an equilibrium point established by the estimated load conductance and knowledge of system parameters. A Lyapunov function is used to establish asymptotic stability in the large for the closed-loop system. To account for practical implementation issues, a new controller relying on feedback of a readily measurable state is also proposed. Simulations results are presented to show efficacy of both controllers with regard to bus voltage regulation and suppression of voltage flicker.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2004.833408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/29666/01347171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2004.833408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29666","startPage":"827","endPage":"842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear controllers for fast Voltage regulation using STATCOMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear controllers for fast Voltage regulation using STATCOMs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8158135","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear controllers for fast Voltage regulation using STATCOMs","sourcePdf":"01347171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033503S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","isNumber":"29666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1347171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1347173,"authors":[{"name":"Jee-Hwan Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/29666/1347173/1347173-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jee-Hwan Ryu (M'02) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Inha University, Inchon, Korea, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Taejon, Korea, in 1995 and 2002, respectively.","Before graduate study, in 1998, he worked as a Visiting Graduate Student in the Biorobotics Division, Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan, and as a Visiting Scholar in the Biorobotics Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, from April to July 2000.

In this approach, the traffic flow process is macroscopically modeled by use of a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The overall problem of coordinated ramp metering is formulated as a constrained discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problem, and a feasible-direction nonlinear optimization algorithm is employed for its numerical solution. The control strategy's efficiency is demonstrated through its application to the 32-km Amsterdam ring road. A number of adequately chosen scenarios along with a thorough analysis, interpretation, and suitable visualization of the obtained results provides a basis for the better understanding of some complex interrelationships of partially conflicting performance criteria. More precisely, the strategy's efficiency and equity properties as well as their tradeoff are studied and their partially competitive behavior is discussed.

It uses a recursive set-partitioning procedure to sort subsets of wavelet coefficients by maximum magnitude with respect to thresholds that are integer powers of two. It exploits two fundamental characteristics of an image transform-the well-defined hierarchical structure, and energy clustering in frequency and in space. The two partition strategies allow for versatile and efficient coding of several image transform structures, including dyadic, blocks inside subbands, wavelet packets, and discrete cosine transform (DCT). We describe the use of this coding algorithm in several implementations, including reversible (lossless) coding and its adaptation for color images, and show extensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art coders, such as set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) and JPEG2000. We conclude that this algorithm, in addition to being very flexible, retains all the desirable features of these algorithms and is highly competitive to them in compression efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/29667/01347192.pdf","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2004.835150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2004.835150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient, low-complexity image coding with a set-partitioning embedded block coder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Partitioning algorithms","Transform coding","Clustering algorithms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Wavelet coefficients","Frequency","Wavelet packets","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","image coding","image colour analysis","block codes","wavelet transforms","pattern clustering","discrete cosine transforms","entropy codes","optimisation","transform coding","trees (mathematics)","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity image coding","recursive set-partitioning embedded block coder","image wavelet transform coding algorithm","hierarchical trees","energy clustering","dyadic image transform","wavelet packets","discrete cosine transform","reversible coding","color image coding","entropy coding","lossless coding","rate distortion optimization","sorting mechanism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Efficient, low-complexity image coding with a set-partitioning embedded block coder","volume":"14","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1347192/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8157464","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient, low-complexity image coding with a set-partitioning embedded block coder","sourcePdf":"01347192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135349S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"29667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"29667","articleId":"1347192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1347193,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The variable complexity algorithm framework has been applied successfully to achieve complexity savings in the computation of the inverse DCT in decoders. These gains can be achieved due to the highly predictable sparseness of the quantized DCT coefficients in natural image/video data. With the increasing demand for instant video messaging and two-way video transmission over mobile communication systems running on general-purpose embedded processors, the encoding complexity needs to be optimized. In this paper, we focus on complexity reduction techniques for the forward DCT, which is one of the more computationally intensive tasks in the encoder. Unlike the inverse DCT, the forward DCT does not operate on sparse input data, but rather generates sparse output data. Thus, complexity reduction must be obtained using different methods from those used for the inverse DCT. In the literature, two major approaches have been applied to speed up the forward DCT computation, namely, frequency selection, in which only a subset of DCT coefficients is computed, and accuracy selection, in which all the DCT coefficients are computed with reduced accuracy. These two approaches can achieve significant computation savings with minor output quality degradation, as long as the coding parameters are such that the quantization error is larger than the error due to the approximate DCT computation. Thus, in order to be useful, these algorithms have to be combined using an efficient mechanism that can select the \"right\" level of approximation as a function of the characteristics of the input and the target rate, a selection that is often based on heuristic criteria. In this paper, we consider two previously proposed fast, variable complexity, forward DCT algorithms, one based on frequency selection, the other based on accuracy selection. We provide an explicit analysis of the additional distortion that each scheme introduces as a function of the quantization parameter and the variance of the input block. This analysis then allows us to improve the performance of these algorithms by making it possible to select the best approximation level for each block and a target quantization parameter. We also propose a hybrid algorithm that combines both forms of complexity reduction in order to achieve overall better performance over a broader range of operating rates. We show how our techniques lead to scalable implementations where complexity can be reduced if needed, at the cost of small reductions in video quality. Our hybrid algorithm can speed up the DCT and quantization process by close to a factor of 4 as compared to fixed-complexity forward DCT implementations, with only a slight quality degradation in PSNR.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2004.835151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2004.835151","endPage":"1248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/29667/01347193.pdf","startPage":"1236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable variable complexity approximate forward DCT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347193/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable variable complexity approximate forward DCT","volume":"14","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"8157465","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1347193/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable variable complexity approximate forward DCT","sourcePdf":"01347193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069124S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"29667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"29667","articleId":"1347193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1347205,"authors":[{"name":"Moon Sig Joo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Silicon Nano Device Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Moon Sig Joo","id":"37272278800"},{"name":"Byung Jin Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Silicon Nano Device Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Byung Jin Cho","id":"37274892100"},{"name":"N.

The classifier designed from these data may be suboptimal. Building classifiers that are robust against changes in prior probabilities is possible by applying a minimax learning strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple fixed-point algorithm that is able to train a neural minimax classifier [i.e., a classifier minimizing the worst (maximum) possible risk]. Moreover, we present a new parametric family of loss functions that is able to provide the most accurate estimates for the posterior class probabilities near the decision regions, and we also discuss the application of these functions together with a minimax learning strategy. The results of the experiments carried out on different real databases point out the ability of the proposed algorithm to find the minimax solution and produce a robust classifier when the real a priori probabilities differ from the estimated ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347290/","volume":"34","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1347290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8154655","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"A fixed-point algorithm to minimax learning with neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fixed-point algorithm to minimax learning with neural networks","sourcePdf":"01347290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087042S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"29671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"29671","articleId":"1347290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1347293,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The main characteristics of the methods are their simplicity and the rapid convergence experimentally validated by the separation of many kinds of signals, such as speech or biomedical data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation in post-nonlinear mixtures using competitive learning, Simulated annealing, and a genetic algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2004.833297","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/29671/01347293.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2004.833297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347293/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation in post-nonlinear mixtures using competitive learning, Simulated annealing, and a genetic algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1347293/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8154658","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation in post-nonlinear mixtures using competitive learning, Simulated annealing, and a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"01347293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066442S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"29671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"29671","articleId":"1347293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1347302,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/29671/1347302/1347302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoli Li received the B.S.E. and M.S.E. degrees from Kun-ming University of Science and Technology, Kun-ming, China, and the Ph.D degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1992, 1995, and 1997, respectively, all in mechanical engineering.","From April 1998 to October 2000, he was a Research Fellow with the Department of Manufacturing Engineering, City University of Hong Kong.

In this paper, the feed-cutting force is estimated using inexpensive current sensors installed on the ac servomotor of a computerized numerical control (CNC) turning center, with the results applied to the intelligent tool wear monitoring system. The mathematical model is used to disclose the implicit dependency of feed-cutting force on feed-motor current and feed speed. Afterwards, a neuro-fuzzy network is used to identify the cutting force with current measurement only. This hybrid math-fuzzy approach will reduce the modeling uncertainty and measurement cost. Finally, the estimated cutting force is applied in the tool-wear monitoring process. Successful experiments demonstrate robustness and effectiveness of the suggested method in the wide range of tool-wear monitoring applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/29671/01347302.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2004.829296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2004.829296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy estimation of feed-cutting force from current measurement-a case study on intelligent tool wear condition monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force measurement","Current measurement","Condition monitoring","Force sensors","Intelligent sensors","Computerized monitoring","Computer numerical control","Manufacturing automation","Manufacturing processes","Machining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric sensing devices","AC motors","servomotors","computerised numerical control","neural nets","electric current measurement","cutting","condition monitoring","fuzzy control","machine tools","computerised monitoring","force measurement","turning (machining)","pattern classification","estimation theory","intelligent manufacturing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manufacturing processing","automated machining","feed-cutting force","current sensor","ac servomotor","computerized numerical control","CNC turning center","intelligent tool wear condition monitoring system","feed-motor current","feed speed","neuro-fuzzy network","hybrid math-fuzzy approach","modeling uncertainty","fuzzy classification","fuzzy estimation","current measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy estimation of feed-cutting force from current measurement-a case study on intelligent tool wear condition monitoring","volume":"34","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1347302/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8154667","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy estimation of feed-cutting force from current measurement-a case study on intelligent tool wear condition monitoring","sourcePdf":"01347302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058564S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"29671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"29671","articleId":"1347302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1347303,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, Universityt of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/29671/1347303/1347303-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongsong Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in management from the University of Arizona, Tucson, in 2002.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

Data mining techniques have been used to uncover hidden patterns and predict future trends and behaviors in financial markets. The competitive advantages achieved by data mining include increased revenue, reduced cost, and much improved marketplace responsiveness and awareness. There has been a large body of research and practice focusing on exploring data mining techniques to solve financial problems.

The design is intended to minimize the power consumption in a low-voltage environment. A load-compensated OTA with rail-to-rail output swing and gain enhancement is chosen in this design, which provides higher power efficiency than the two-stage OTA. To lower the power consumption further, class-AB operation is also adapted in the OTA design. Due to the relatively low threshold voltage of the advanced technology, no clock bootstrapping circuits are needed to drive the switches and the power consumption of the digital circuits is reduced. All the capacitors are implemented using multilayer metal-wall structure, which can provide high-density capacitance. The modulator achieves 88-dB dynamic range in 20-kHz signal bandwidth with an oversampling ratio of 100.

The driving scheme incorporates two output driving stages in which the output of the first output driving stage is connected to the inverting input and that of the second driving stage is connected to the capacitive load. A compensation resistor is connected between the two output stages for stability. The second output stage is used to improve the slew rate and the settling time. The buffer draws little current while static but has a large driving capability while transient. The circuit achieves the large driving capability by employing simple comparators to sense the transients of the input to turn on the output stages, which are statically off in the stable state. This increases the speed of the circuit without increasing static power consumption too much. A rail-to-rail folded-cascode differential amplifier is used to amplify the input signal difference and supply the bias voltages for the second stage. An experimental prototype output buffer implemented in a 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology demonstrates that the circuit draws only 7-/spl mu/A static current and exhibits the settling times of 2.7 /spl mu/s for rising and 2.9 /spl mu/s for falling edges for a voltage swing of 3.3 V under a 600-pF capacitance load with a power supply of 3.3 V.

The performance of these cells is characterized by the sampling accuracy and voltage droop that can be achieved with a given level of die area and power. Hand calculations suggest past implementations have not achieved minimum voltage droop due to uncompensated MOS leakage mechanisms. In this paper, the dominant sources of MOS leakage are experimentally characterized in a standard 1.5-/spl mu/m CMOS process using an on-chip current integration technique, focusing specifically on the 1 fA to 1 aA current range. These measurements reveal an accumulation-mode source-drain coupling mechanism that can easily dominate diode leakage under certain bias conditions and may have limited previous designs. A simple rule-of-thumb is offered for avoiding this leakage effect, leading to a novel ultra-low leakage switch topology. A differential storage cell incorporating this new switch achieves an average leakage of 10 aA at room temperature, an 8/spl times/ reduction over past designs. The cell loses one bit of voltage accuracy, 700 /spl mu/V on a 12-bit scale and 11.3 mV on an 8-bit scale, in 3.3 and 54 min, respectively. This represents a 15/spl times/ increase in hold time at these voltage accuracies over the lowest leakage cell to date, in only 92% of the area. Since the leakage is independent of amplifier bias, the cell can operate on as little as 10 nW of power. Initial measurements also indicate the switch's leakage decreases with the square of process feature size.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347329","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Switches","Circuits","Sampling methods","CMOS process","Diodes","Topology","Temperature","Power amplifiers","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue storage","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","leakage currents","CMOS memory circuits","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog storage cell","temporary local memory","sampling accuracy","voltage droop","MOS leakage mechanisms","CMOS process","on-chip current integration technique","accumulation-mode source-drain coupling mechanism","diode leakage","bias conditions","ultra-low leakage switch topology","differential storage cell","analog memory","junction leakage","sample-and-hold","weak inversion","10 nW","12 bit","1.5 micron","700 muV","11.3 mV","3.3 min","54 min"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/29672/01347329.pdf","startPage":"1985","endPage":"1996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2004.835817","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2004.835817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10-nW 12-bit accurate analog storage cell with 10-aA leakage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347329/","displayDocTitle":"A 10-nW 12-bit accurate analog storage cell with 10-aA leakage","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8164823","htmlLink":"/document/1347329/","volume":"39","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10-nW 12-bit accurate analog storage cell with 10-aA leakage","sourcePdf":"01347329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110852S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"29672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"29672","articleId":"1347329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1347331,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/29672/1347331/1347331-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Wei Lin was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1975.

The read margin loss caused by the combination effect of these two disturbance mechanisms is serious enough to eliminate the read margin window, which is already small when the power supply voltage is about 1.8 V and when a memory cell stores 2 bits. This paper introduces for the first time the sense current recovery technique to counteract the side-leakage current effect and the differential feedback cascoded bitline control technique to minimize the complementary-bit disturbance. A 1.8-V 256-Mb 2-bit-per-cell virtual-ground flash memory employing the two techniques has been integrated using 0.13-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. These two sensing techniques are essential for the memory to achieve 49-ns initial read access and 200-MHz internal burst read access.

The STF basis is generated from a prototype pulse via time-frequency shifts. In general, the orthogonality between basis functions is destroyed at the receiver due to channel dispersion. The starting point of this work is a pulse scale adaptation rule first proposed by Kozek to minimize the interference between the basis functions. We show that the average signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) ratio associated with different basis functions is identical and is maximized by the scale adaptation rule. The results in this paper highlight the critical impact of the channel spread factor, the product of multipath and Doppler spreads, on system performance. Smaller spread factors result in lesser interference such that a scale-adapted STF basis serves as an approximate eigenbasis for the channel. A highly effective iterative interference cancellation technique is proposed for mitigating the residual interference for larger spread factors. The approximate eigendecomposition leads to an intuitively appealing block-fading interpretation of the channel in terms of time-frequency coherence subspaces: the channel is highly correlated within each coherence subspace whereas it is approximately independent across different subspaces. The block-fading model also yields an approximate expression for the coherent channel capacity in terms of parallel flat-fading channels. The deviation of the capacity of doubly dispersive channels from that of flat-fading channels is quantified by studying the moments of the channel eigenvalue distribution. In particular, the difference between the moments of doubly dispersive and flat-fading channels is proportional to channel spread factor. The results in this paper indicate that the proposed STF signaling framework is applicable for spread factors as large as 0.01.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2004.836931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/29673/01347350.pdf","startPage":"2583","endPage":"2603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2004.836931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal time-frequency signaling over doubly dispersive channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347350/","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal time-frequency signaling over doubly dispersive channels","volume":"50","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8173710","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1347350/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal time-frequency signaling over doubly dispersive channels","sourcePdf":"01347350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077535S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"29673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"29673","articleId":"1347350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1347351,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This result is extended to find the power-constrained capacity region of the system; this is the set of all achievable rate-tuples over all signature sequences and power-control policies whose sum-power is constrained. Furthermore, it is shown that this capacity region may be substantially and maximally expanded in those regions where there are oversized users whose rate requirements are relatively large compared to those of the other users; this is accomplished by allowing for the flexibility of multidimensional signaling in the sense of a user simultaneously transmitting several different scalar symbols, each modulated by its own signature sequence. From the viewpoint of resource efficiency, this means that a multicarrier approach is essential in systems that support multiple classes of users.

The optimum minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver is first considered. Because this receiver requires the knowledge of the code vectors attributed to all the users within the cell when these vectors are time varying, its use may be unrealistic in the forward link. A classical suboptimum receiver, consisting in a chip rate equalizer followed by a despreading with the code of the user of interest, is therefore studied and compared to the optimum MMSE receiver. Performance of both receivers is assessed through the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at their outputs. The analytical expressions of these SINRs depend in a rather nonexplicit way on the codes allocated to the users of the cell, and are therefore not informative. This difficulty is dealt with by modeling the users code matrix by a random matrix. Because the code matrices used in the forward link are usually isometric, the code matrix is assumed to be extracted from a Haar-distributed random unitary matrix. The behavior of the SINRs is studied when the spreading factor and the number of users converge to /spl infin/ at the same rate. Using certain results of the free probability theory, we establish the fact that the SINRs converge almost surely toward quantities that depend only on the complex amplitudes of propagation channel paths. We then use the expressions of these SINR limits to discuss the influence of the various parameters on the performance of the receivers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/29673/01347352.pdf","startPage":"2620","endPage":"2638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2004.836929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2004.836929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of optimum and suboptimum CDMA downlink MMSE receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors","Frequency","Vectors","Interference","Equalizers","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","least mean squares methods","radio receivers","radio links","equalisers","time-varying channels","matrix algebra","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic analysis","linear CDMA downlink MMSE receiver","code-division multiple-access downlink transmission","frequency-selective channel","minimum mean-square error receiver","code vector","time varying channel","chip rate equalizer","despreading","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","code matrix","isometric forward link","Haar-distributed random unitary matrix","spreading factor","propagation channel path","probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of optimum and suboptimum CDMA downlink MMSE receivers","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1347352/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8164872","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic analysis of optimum and suboptimum CDMA downlink MMSE receivers","sourcePdf":"01347352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11546S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"29673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"29673","articleId":"1347352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1347353,"authors":[{"name":"Yindi Jing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yindi Jing","id":"37276970200"},{"name":"B.

EXIT functions are defined using the model, and several properties of such functions are proved for erasure channels. One property expresses the area under an EXIT function in terms of a conditional entropy. A useful consequence of this result is that the design of capacity-approaching codes reduces to a curve-fitting problem for all the aforementioned codes. A second property relates the EXIT function of a code to its Helleseth-Klove-Levenshtein information functions, and thereby to the support weights of its subcodes. The relation is via a refinement of information functions called split information functions, and via a refinement of support weights called split support weights.

The redundancy (regret) of universal fixed-to-variable length coding for a class of sources determines by how much the actual code length exceeds the optimal (ideal over the class) code length. In a minimax scenario one finds the best code for the worst source either in the worst case (called also maximal minimax) or on average. We first study the worst case minimax redundancy over a class of stationary ergodic sources and replace Shtarkov's bound by an exact formula. Among others, we prove that a generalized Shannon code minimizes the worst case redundancy, derive asymptotically its redundancy, and establish some general properties. This allows us to obtain precise redundancy for memoryless, Markov, and renewal sources. For example, we present the exact constant of the redundancy for memoryless and Markov sources by showing that the integer nature of coding contributes log(logm/(m-1))/logm+o(1) where m is the size of the alphabet. Then we deal with the average minimax redundancy and regret. Our approach here is orthogonal to most recent research in this area since we aspire to show that asymptotically the average minimax redundancy is equivalent to the worst case minimax redundancy for some classes of sources. After formulating some general bounds relating these two redundancies, we prove our assertion for memoryless and Markov sources. Nevertheless, we provide evidence that maximal redundancy of renewal processes does not have the same leading term as the average minimax redundancy (however, our general results show that maximal and average regrets are asymptotically equivalent).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8173713","htmlLink":"/document/1347356/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Precise minimax redundancy and regret","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise minimax redundancy and regret","sourcePdf":"01347356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122912S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"29673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"29673","articleId":"1347356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1347363,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In addition, for long codes, ML decoding becomes prohibitively complex. Nevertheless, bounds on the performance of ML decoded systems provide insight into the effect of system parameters on the overall system performance as well as a measure of goodness of the suboptimum decoding methods used in practice. Using the so-called Gallager's first bounding technique (involving a so-called Gallager region) and within the framework of tangential sphere bound (TSB) of Poltyrev, we develop a general bound referred to as the generalized TSB (GTSB). The Gallager region is chosen to be a general hyper-surface of revolution (HSR) which is optimized to tighten the bound. The search for the optimal Gallager region is a classical problem dating back to Gallager's thesis in the early 1960s. For the random coding case, Gallager provided the optimal solution in a closed form while for the nonrandom case the problem has been an active area of research in information theory for many years. We prove that for a sphere code, the optimal HSR within the proposed GTSB is a hyper-cone. This will climax to the TSB of Poltyrev, one of the tightest bounds ever developed for binary block codes, and therefore terminates the search for a better Gallager region in the groundwork of the GTSB.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/29673/01347368.pdf","startPage":"2810","endPage":"2815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2004.836666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2004.836666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized tangential sphere bound on the ML decoding error probability of linear binary block codes in AWGN interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Block codes","AWGN","Interference","Maximum likelihood decoding","Upper bound","System performance","Information theory","Additive white noise","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood decoding","error statistics","block codes","binary codes","linear codes","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized tangential sphere bound","ML decoding","error probability","linear binary block codes","AWGN interference","maximum-likelihood decoding","soft-decision decoding","long codes","system performance","goodness measure","suboptimum decoding methods","Gallager bounding technique","Gallager region","generalized TSB","general hyper-surface of revolution","nonrandom coding","hyper-cone"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","displayDocTitle":"Generalized tangential sphere bound on the ML decoding error probability of linear binary block codes in AWGN interference","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1347368/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8387249","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized tangential sphere bound on the ML decoding error probability of linear binary block codes in AWGN interference","sourcePdf":"01347368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083846S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"29673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"29673","articleId":"1347368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1347371,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongseok Ha","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Jeongseok Ha","id":"37277115300"},{"name":"Jaehong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Jaehong Kim","id":"37281207800"},{"name":"S.W.

However, most of the existing space-time code construction methods have assumed ideal channel models: either quasi-static fading or fast fading. In this work, we propose a systematic space-time trellis code construction method for correlated fading channels. We derive the performance criteria that take into account both spatial and temporal channel correlation, assuming that the space-time correlation matrix is of full rank. Moreover, we introduce a new design criterion and analyze the properties of the space-time trellis codes satisfying the proposed criterion. Using the design criterion, we develop a code construction procedure that jointly considers diversity advantage and coding advantage for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas and any memoryless modulation. The flexibility of the proposed code construction method is demonstrated by designing space-time trellis codes for two, three, and four transmit antennas with quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK), 8PSK (phase-shift keying), and 4ASK (amplitude-shift keying) modulations. The simulation results demonstrate that not only can our method generate new codes for an arbitrary number of antennas, but in some special cases, where previously proposed codes exist, our codes also perform very well.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2004.836926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/29673/01347375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2004.836926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29673","startPage":"2855","endPage":"2865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic space-time trellis code construction for correlated Rayleigh-fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Systematic space-time trellis code construction for correlated Rayleigh-fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8387256","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1347375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic space-time trellis code construction for correlated Rayleigh-fading channels","sourcePdf":"01347375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121365S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"29673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"29673","articleId":"1347375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1347383,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Strained silicon is used to increase saturated n-type and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) drive currents by 10% and 25%, respectively. Using selective epitaxial Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ in the source and drain regions, longitudinal uniaxial compressive stress is introduced into the p-type MOSEFT to increase hole mobility by >50%. A tensile silicon nitride-capping layer is used to introduce tensile strain into the n-type MOSFET and enhance electron mobility by 20%. Unlike all past strained-Si work, the hole mobility enhancement in this paper is present at large vertical electric fields in nanoscale transistors making this strain technique useful for advanced logic technologies. Furthermore, using piezoresistance coefficients it is shown that significantly less strain (/spl sim/5 /spl times/) is needed for a given PMOS mobility enhancement when applied via longitudinal uniaxial compression versus in-plane biaxial tension using the conventional Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ substrate approach.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2004.836648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/29674/01347396.pdf","startPage":"1790","endPage":"1797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2004.836648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 90-nm logic technology featuring strained-silicon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347396/","displayDocTitle":"A 90-nm logic technology featuring strained-silicon","volume":"51","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8237272","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1347396/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 90-nm logic technology featuring strained-silicon","sourcePdf":"01347396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225059S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"29674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"495","xplore-issue":"29674","articleId":"1347396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":1347397,"authors":[{"name":"Xuguang Wang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/29674/1347397/1347397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuguang Wang received the B.S. degree in material science and engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Rice University, Houston, TX, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

Process compatibility and memory operation of the device were investigated. Results show that Ge-NC have good thermal stability in the HfAlO matrix as indicated by the negative Gibbs free energy changes for both reactions of GeO/sub 2/+Hf/spl rarr/HfO/sub 2/+Ge and 3GeO/sub 2/+4Al/spl rarr/2Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/+3Ge. This stability implies that the fabricated structure can be compatible with the standard CMOS process with the ability to sustain source-drain activation anneal temperatures. Compared with Si-NC embedded in HfO/sub 2/, Ge-NC embedded in HfAlO can provide more electron traps, thereby enlarging the memory window. It is also shown that this structure can achieve a low programming voltage of 6-7 V for fast programming, a long charge retention time of ten years maintaining a 0.7-V memory window, and good endurance characteristics of up to 10/sup 6/ rewrite cycles. This paper shows that the Ge-NC embedded in HfAlO is a promising candidate for further scaling of FG Flash memory devices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2004.837011","doi":"10.1109/TED.2004.837011","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1848","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/29674/01347403.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347403/","displayDocTitle":"Nonvolatile flash memory device using Ge nanocrystals embedded in HfAlO high-/spl kappa/tunneling and control oxides: Device fabrication and electrical performance","volume":"51","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"8237279","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1347403/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonvolatile flash memory device using Ge nanocrystals embedded in HfAlO high-/spl kappa/tunneling and control oxides: Device fabrication and electrical performance","sourcePdf":"01347403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085981S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"29674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"29674","articleId":"1347403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1347457,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A human-like body will provide an abundance of nonverbal information and enable us to smoothly communicate with the robot. To achieve this, we developed a humanoid robot that autonomously interacts with humans by speaking and gesturing. Interaction achieved through a large number of interactive behaviors, which are developed by using a visualizing tool for understanding the developed complex system. Each interactive behavior is designed by using knowledge obtained through cognitive experiments and implemented by using situated recognition. The robot is used as a testbed for studying embodied communication. Our strategy is to analyze human-robot interaction in terms of body movements using a motion-capturing system that allows us to measure the body movements in detail. We performed experiments to compare the body movements with subjective evaluation based on a psychological method. The results reveal the importance of well-coordinated behaviors as well as the performance of the developed interactive behaviors and suggest a new analytical approach to human-robot interaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1347463/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2004","accessionNumber":"8167250","volume":"92","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Development and evaluation of interactive humanoid robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and evaluation of interactive humanoid robots","sourcePdf":"01347463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06364S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"29676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"29676","articleId":"1347463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1347572,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A typical rule of thumb is that random input offsets of up to 40 mV can be expected in sense amplifiers as a result of inevitable device parameter variations. A related rule of thumb is that the bitline signals should be no less than 100 mV to be reliably sensed in the presence of memory array noise, cell charge leakage, and other inevitable error sources, including the input offset of the sense amplifier. A primary cause of input offset are differences between the device parameters of the main, supposedly matched, sensing transistors. We report the results of a simulation study that determined the dependence of the input offset against mismatch in the threshold voltage of the sensing. transistors. Assuming transistor models from a 180 nm CMOS logic technology, we compared the conventional latch-type sense amplifier with three input offset cancelling sense amplifier designs that were proposed by S. Suzuki and M. Hirata (see IEEE J. of Solid-State Circuits, vol.SC-14, no.6, p.1066-70, 1979), T. Furuyama et al. (see IEDM, p.44-7, 1981), and Y. Watanabe et al.

This is of particular importance to multicarrier schemes, such as OFDM, that are much more sensitive to frequency and phase errors then single-carrier schemes. The paper analyzes the performance of self-heterodyne receivers, assuming OFDM is the modulation scheme. We start by deriving the autocorrelation function and power spectral density (PSD) at the output of a square-law device, assuming the phase noise is modeled as a Wiener-Levy process. From this we characterize the BER performance and compare it with simulation of 4,16, and 64-QAM OFDM schemes. Previous statistical analysis of this receiver type has ignored the stochastic nature of the RF phase noise and has neglected to consider the effects of IF instabilities on BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347599","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Efficient test and debug techniques for VLSI chips are indispensable in Deep Submicron technologies. A systematic debug scheme is also necessary in order to reduce time-to-market. Due to stringent timing requirements of modern chips, test and debug schemes have to be tailored for detection and debug of functional defects as well as delay faults quickly and efficiently. The proposed technique facilitates an efficient scheme for detecting and debugging delay faults and has minimal area and power overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ETSYM.2004.1347600","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

By the research, especially by simulation, it is shown that, in multi-flat fading channels, the STTC-OFDM system can potentially provide more coding gain.

The error at the output of a reference model, which defines the desired error dynamics, and the output of ANN/sub FBK/ are respectively used as the error signal for adaptation of ANN/sub FBK/ and ANN/sub FF/. The contribution of the paper is to propose a rule based supervisor for online adaptation of the parameters of the reference model to maintain stability of the system for large variations of load parameters. The controller is suitable for DSP and VLSI implementation and can be used to improve static and dynamic performance of electromechanical systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29659","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The originality of the proposed method is that the feedforward and the feedback filters are adjusted simultaneously by using the high order MCMA algorithm and by switching to the decision directed mode when the equalized symbols are in the convergence zones. This method reduces the propagation of error caused by the DFE structure. The mean square error (MSE) between the transmitted symbols and the equalized symbols is computed as performance metric. The proposed method is compared to the classic DFE based on second order MCMA. For all simulations, the ensemble-averaged MSE is obtained from 100 Monte Carlo runs. The obtained result show that the proposed method performs well for high constellations in the presence of Gaussian noise, comparatively with other methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29659","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The block source-channel encoder is defined by a vector quantizer (VQ). The jointly optimum solution to such a problem has been considered before, but its high complexity makes it impractical for systems with medium to large number of users. Instead, the optimum linear decoder with a lower complexity that minimizes the mean squared error is introduced. The linear decoder is soft in the sense that it utilizes all the soft information available at the receiver. Analytical and simulation results show that at low channel signal to noise ratio, the proposed decoder's performance is almost the same as that of the jointly optimum decoder and significantly better than that of a tandem approach which uses separate multiuser detection and table-lookup decoding.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347662","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

We consider a cellular relay network (CRN) where a large number of low-complexity/low-power wireless fixed relays are deployed around the central node (equivalent of a BS) in each cell. Each relay and central node covers only a small area with a small amount of power, enabling the reuse of the frequency-time resources. The paper evaluates the cell capacity (i.e., aggregate throughput) in the CRN, and compares the cell capacities of the CRN and of the conventional cellular network.

Two promising techniques to counter these problems are space-time coding and iterative multiuser detection. In this paper, an iterative receiver structure for space-time block coded MC-CDMA system employing multiple transmit and receive antennas is presented. The receiver is based on the minimum mean square error decision feedback multiuser detection. The log-likelihood ratios computed by the soft multiuser detector are refined successively during the iterative process by using the extrinsic information available through decoding of all users. Turbo code is used for channel coding.

In the present work, the problem is restricted to a well-defined small object that is readily distinguished from the background scene. The emphasis is on the maintenance of an accurate trajectory estimation as the target moves from the near field to the far field (or vice versa) and traverses a large field of view. To address this and related scenarios, a prototype compound-eye image sensor, named \"DragonflEYE\", has been designed and fabricated. In essence, the compound-eye sensor uses a large number (10/sup 1/-10/sup 3/) of identical \"eyelets\" to cover a large angular field of view. The degree of overlap of the eyelet fields of view is an important system parameter that strongly influences the tracking problem. Selected highlights of the design and implementation of DragonflEYE are described. For the precision-tracking function, the following factors need to be assessed: coverage overlap, update rate, frame timing, subpixel calibration of multiple eyelet lenses and processing algorithms and approaches. Investigations with conventional cameras indicate that the instantaneous location precision can be 0.01 to 0.1 pixel for the centroid of a suitable 'spot object' in a favourable scenario. The calibration of multiple \"eyelets\" of the compound eye to the same level of precision is expected to be important for precision tracking over a wide field of view. Preliminary experimental results for calibration for tracking applications are presented and evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347710","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The paper considers two constraints which represent quality of service (QoS) measures that a network should provide for real-time applications. First, a constraint on end-to-end delay from source to each destination, second, bounded delay variations along the paths from source to each destination. A genetic algorithm for delay and delay variation multicast routing (GADVM) is proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulations and compared with four known multicast routing algorithms, namely, BSMA, CDKS, SPT, and KPP. Two performance metrics are considered, the failure rate and average cost per path. It is demonstrated that the GADVM algorithm compares favourably and gives much lower failure rates; its cost is also comparable with, and in some cases is better than, other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347721","startPage":"2363","endPage":"2366 Vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

By using radio-over-fiber (ROF) technology, the capacity of optical networks can be combined with the flexibility and mobility of wireless access networks without significant cost increment. The radio-over-fiber concept means to transport information over optical-fiber by modulating the light with the radio signal. This article discusses the effects of using fiber in conjunction with wireless local area network IEEE 802.11a standard (WLAN) to distribute RF signals. To achieve high throughput 802.11a LAN uses an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based multicarrier wideband modulation technique. OFDM is one of the most favored modulation techniques in the WLAN scenario due to its efficient implementation and robustness against multipath and narrowband interference. One of the biggest drawbacks of OFDM is its high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). High PAPR of OFDM makes it unusable in nonlinear systems. In this article we discuss better ways to overcome the PAPR problem of the OFDM signal which will improve its performance in fiber.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Defect tolerance techniques are therefore essential to obtain an acceptable manufacturing yield. In this paper, we investigate defect tolerance properties of a 2D nano-scale crossbar, which is the basic block of various nano architectures which have been recently proposed. Various nano-wire and switch faults are studied and their impact on the routability of a crossbar are investigated. In the presence of defects, it is still possible to utilize a defective crossbar at reduced functionality, i.e. as a smaller defect-free crossbar. Simulation results for different sizes and defect densities are presented. This proposed approach can be utilized by architecture designers to determine the expected size of functional (defect-free) crossbar based on defect density information obtained from the fabrication process.","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.2004.1347829","publicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems, 2004.

An important parameter to define is the level of TID the device can tolerate. This value is very useful in order to predict its operative life time in a radiation environment. In this paper an online monitoring method to measure the degradation of synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) commercial off the shelf (COTS) devices due to TID is proposed. The method is based on the measurement of the bit retention time, that is the time the information is retained in a memory cell without refresh. This approach is based on the observation that on same die, a dispersion of the devices' characteristics exists. So, the device degradation will appear in a more evident way in those memory cells having worst electrical characteristics. For this reason, there is a gradual increment of the number of memory cells that do not maintain their initialization value with the increment of the absorbed dose. The proposed method is useful to monitor the real level of degradation of a SDRAM device in order to optimize maintenance activity and graceful performance degradation techniques. SDRAM devices are used as a TID radiation defector to monitor the real dose absorbed by itself, and thus by the whole apparatus. The method is based on functional test that a SDRAM controller can easily perform on empty memory blocks without requiring dedicated hardware. This paper presents the experimental setup and the results of a preliminary TID test with a /sup 60/Co gamma ray source on SDRAM COTS to validate the method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","SDRAM","Degradation","Testing","Solid state circuits","Ionizing radiation","DRAM chips","Time measurement","Random access memory","Electric variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","SRAM chips","integrated circuit testing","gamma-ray effects","integrated circuit reliability","condition monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TID damage monitoring methodology","SDRAM devices","retention time analysis","total ionizing dose","ionizing radiations","TID tolerance level","radiation environment","operative life time","online monitoring method","synchronous dynamic RAM","commercial off the shelf devices","bit retention time","memory cell","device degradation","electrical characteristics","cell initialization value","absorbed dose","maintenance activity","TID radiation detector","functional test","SDRAM controller memory blocks","Co gamma ray source","SDRAM COTS","Co"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1347830","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.2004.1347830","displayPublicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems, 2004.

This algorithm (referred to as March-NU) relies on a new fault model which extends fault detection to three additional types of coupling faults, i.e. read destructive, deceptive read destructive and incorrect read coupling faults. These faults are related to well known fault mechanisms, that have been reported in the literature, which occur in the read operation of SRAMs. Previous algorithms can not guarantee 100% fault detection of these coupling faults. March-NU sensitizes and detects with 100% coverage all coupling faults as well as traditional faults. A detailed analysis of its fault detection capabilities are presented. March-NU utilizes 8 March elements and its complexity is 30N, where N is the number of words in the WOM under test.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1347831/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2004","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8200059","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1347831/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Testing of inter-word coupling faults in word-oriented SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing of inter-word coupling faults in word-oriented SRAMs","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"01347831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061807S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9332","isNumber":"29643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"29643","articleId":"1347831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1347832,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The improvements are mainly two-fold. On one hand, the testing of time-consuming data retention faults (DRFs), that is neglected by the previously proposed test architecture, is now considered and performed via a DFT technique referred to as the \"no write recovery test mode (XWRTM)\". On the other hand, a parallel local response analyzer (LRA), instead of a serial response analyzer, is used to reduce the test time of these distributed small e-SRAMs. Results from our evaluations show that the proposed test architecture can achieve a better defect coverage and test time compared to those obtained previously, with a negligible area cost.","publicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems, 2004.

So far, reliability has not been considered a primary objective. Recently, several error detecting schemes have been proposed in order to provide some defense against hardware faults in AES. The benefits of such schemes are twofold: avoiding wrong outputs when benign hardware faults occur, and preventing the collection of information about the secret key through malicious injection of faults. In this paper, we present a complete scheme for parity-based fault detection in a hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard which includes a key schedule unit.

Consequently, it is inherently insensitive to process, power supply and temperature variations.

Error-resilience is related to the capability of a test data stream (or sequence) to tolerate bit-flips which may occur in an automatic test equipment (ATE), either in the electronics components of the loadboard or in the high speed serial communication links between the user interface workstation and the head. Initially, it is shown that errors caused by bit-flips can seriously degrade test quality (as measured by the coverage), as such degradation is very significant for variable codeword techniques such as Huffman coding. To address this issue a variable-to-constant compression technique (namely Tunstall coding) is proposed. Using Tunstall coding and bit-padding to preserve vector boundaries, an error-resilient compression technique is proposed. This technique requires a simple algorithm for compression and its hardware for decompression is very small, while achieving a much higher error-resilience against bit-flips compared with previous techniques (albeit at a small reduction in compression). Simulation results on benchmark circuits are provided to substantiate the validity of this approach in an ATE environment.","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.2004.1347855","publicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems, 2004.

The solution achieves low-cost testing by employing not only selective Huffman vertical coding (SHVC) for test stimuli compression, but also MISR-based time compactor for test responses compaction. Moreover, the solution is non-intrusive, since it can tolerate any number of unknown states in output responses such that it does not require modifying the logic of core to eliminate or block the sources of unknown states. Furthermore, the solution obtains improved diagnostic capability over conventional MISR by combining masking logic with a modified MISR. Experimental results for ISCAS 89 benchmarks as well as a platform FPGA chip have proven the efficiency of the proposed test solution.","publicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems, 2004.

In this paper, we present an overview of the existing coding schemes and show that they require either a large wiring overhead or complex encoder-decoder circuits. We propose a family of codes referred to as overlapping codes that reduce both overheads. We construct two codes from this family and demonstrate their superiority over existing schemes in terms of area and energy dissipation.

A comparison between two signed 16-b multipliers, where both perform single 8-b multiplications, shows that the twin-precision multiplier has 72% lower power dissipation and 15% higher speed than the conventional one, while only requiring 8% more transistors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2004.1347894","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004.

Several techniques have been developed to help reduce leakage in SRAM-based memory, in which the percent leakage power is especially acute. SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) pose similar leakage problems, but their structure and function require different solutions. This paper introduces a low complexity post-processing approach to reducing FPGA leakage current by ground-gating off SRAM cells that are unused in a particular device configuration. The approach is general enough to apply to any device configuration, and results reveal that the significant leakage current reduction can be achieved with no delay penalty and acceptable area overhead.","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004.

We survey four techniques for achieving variable energy per instruction: voltage/frequency scaling, asymmetric cores, variable-size cores, and speculation control. We estimate the potential range of energies obtainable by each technique and conclude that a combination of asymmetric cores and voltage/frequency scaling offers the most promising approach to design a chip-level multiprocessor that can achieve both excellent latency performance and excellent throughput performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2004.1347928","startPage":"236","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004.

NoC architecture consists of a collection of IP cores or processing elements (PEs) interconnected by on-chip switching fabrics or routers. Hardware virtualization, which maps logic processing units onto PEs, affects the power consumption of each PE and the communications among PEs. The communication among PEs affects the overall performance and router power consumption, and it depends on the placement of PEs. Therefore, the temperature distribution profile of the chip depends on the IP core virtualization and placement. In this paper, we present an IP virtualization and placement algorithm for generic regular network on chip (NoC) architecture. The algorithm attempts to achieve a thermal balanced design while minimizing the communication cost via placement. Our framework can also realize hardware virtualization which can further accomplish better performance. A case study on low density parity checks (LDPC) decoder is presented to evaluate our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2004.1347958","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004.

An alternative to building large register files is to use smaller number of registers, but manage them more effectively. More efficient management of registers can also result in higher performance if the reduction of the register file size is not the goal. Traditional register file management mechanisms deallocate a physical register only when the next instruction with the same destination architectural register commits. We propose two complementary techniques for deallocating the register immediately after the instruction producing the register's value commits itself, without waiting for the commitment of the next instruction with the same destination. Our design relies on the use of a checkpointed register file (CRF), where a local shadow copy of each bitcell is used to temporarily save the early deallocated register values should they be needed to recover from branch mispredictions or to reconstruct the precise state after exceptions or interrupts. The proposed techniques outperform the previously proposed schemes for early deallocation of registers. For the register-constrained datapath configurations, our techniques result in up to 35% performance increase with 23.3% increase on the average across SPEC2000 benchmarks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing processor performance through early register release","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004.

As communication links consume significant power regardless of utilization, we propose and investigate power-aware networks whose links are turned on and off in response to bursts and dips in traffic. We explore the design space of such on/off networks, outlining a 5-step design methodology along with solutions at each step that can form the building blocks of numerous designs. Two specific designs targeting links with substantially different on/off times are then presented and evaluated. Our simulations show that up to 54.4% power savings can be achieved along with at most 7.5% increase in latency.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2004.1347970","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004.

Due to flip-chip technology, I/O can be placed throughout the whole chip without long wires from the periphery of the chip. However, because of I/O placement constraints in design cost and performance, I/O buffer planning becomes a pressing problem. During the early stages of circuits and packaging co-design, I/O layout should be evaluated to optimize design cost and to avoid product failures. In this paper, our objective is to better an existing/initial standard cell placement by I/O clustering, considering design cost reduction and signal integrity preservation. We formulate it as a minimum cost flow problem minimizing /spl alpha/W+/spl beta/D, where W is the I/O wirelength of the placement and D is the total voltage drop in the power network. The experimental results on some MCNC benchmarks show that our method achieves better timing performance and averagely over 30% design cost reduction when compared with the conventional design rule of thumb popularly used by circuit designers.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2004.1347978","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004.

Obtained results are compared with and verified by experimental heat transfer data for PE insulated cable. In order to minimize the truncation error arising from the boundary condition choice, two different boundary conditions for the selected boundaries namely Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are applied for different domain dimensions, and, it is shown that appropriate solution domain can be obtained. Then, PE and XLPE insulated cables are compared from the heat transfer point of view. Cable temperature dependency to variations in thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium and loading is investigated. Thus, correction factors given by cable manufacturers regarding cable current carrying capacity are obtained by using the finite element model developed in this study.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2004.1348103","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference (IEEE Cat.

Current attack prevention mechanisms rely on end-user cooperation to install new system patches or upgrade security software, yielding slow reaction time. However, malicious attacks spread much faster than users can respond, making effective attack prevention difficult network-based mechanisms, by avoiding end-user coordination, can respond rapidly to new attacks. Such mechanisms require the network to inspect the packet payload at line rates to detect and filter those packets containing worm signatures. These signature sets are large (e.g., thousands) and complex. Software-only implementations are unlikely to meet the performance goals. Therefore, making a network-based scheme practical requires efficient algorithms suitable for hardware implementations. This work develops a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) based multiple-pattern matching scheme. The scheme can handle complex patterns; such as arbitrarily long patterns, correlated patterns, and patterns with negation. For the ClamAv virus database with 1768 patterns whose sizes vary from 6 bytes to 2189 bytes, the proposed scheme can operate at a 2 Gbps rate with a 240 KB TCAM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gigabit rate packet pattern-matching using TCAM","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, 2004.

PLC causes significant imbalance in the throughputs of sources. Existing 802.11b simulators, including ns2 and Qualnet, assume that PLC occurs only if the stronger frame arrives first at the receiver. We show empirically that in reality PLC occurs even if the stronger frame arrives later (but within the physical layer preamble of the first frame). Consequently, throughput unfairness in reality can be significantly (up to 15%) higher than with the former PLC model. We have modified the ns2 simulator to account for this and Qualnet is incorporating a fix in their next release. To identify which frames were involved in collisions, when their transmissions started, and which of them were retrieved, we have devised a novel technique using multiple sniffers and instrumented device drivers to reconstruct from the air interface all tx/rx events in a WLAN to within 4 /spl mu/s accuracy. This allows us to quantify the causal links from the PHY layer through the MAC layer to the observed application layer imbalance. It also shows that the arrival times of colliding frames routinely differ by as much as 20 /spl mu/s due to inherent uncertainties of 802.11b firmware clock synchronization and rx/tx turnaround delays, and that the frame to arrive first can be either the stronger or the weaker with equal likelihood.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, 2004.

In a wireless neighborhood network, a few Internet transit access points (ITAPs), serving as gateways to the Internet, are deployed across the neighborhood; houses are equipped with low-cost antennas, and form a multi-hop wireless network among themselves to cooperatively route traffic to the Internet through the ITAPs. Furthermore, the placement of Internet TAPs is a critical determinant of system performance and resource usage. We explore the placement problem under three wireless link models. For each link model, we develop algorithms to make informed placement decisions based on neighborhood layouts, user demands, and wireless link characteristics. We also extend our algorithms to provide fault tolerance and handle significant workload variation. We evaluate our placement algorithms and show that our algorithms yield close to optimal solutions over a wide range of scenarios we have considered.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348117","startPage":"271","endPage":"282","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, 2004.

Briefly, deafness is caused when a transmitter fails to communicate to its intended receiver, because the receiver is beamformed towards a direction away from the transmitter. Existing CSMA/CA protocols rely on the assumption that congestion is the predominant cause of communication failure, and adopt backoff schemes to handle congestion. While this may be appropriate for omnidirectional antennas, for directional antennas, both deafness and congestion can be the reason for communication failures. An appropriate directional MAC protocol needs to classify the actual cause of failure, and react accordingly. This paper quantifies the impact of deafness on directional medium access control, and proposes a tone-based mechanism as one way of addressing deafness. The tone-based mechanism, ToneDMAC, assumes congestion as the default reason for communication failures, and applies a corrective measure whenever the cause is deafness. Simulation results indicate that ToneDMAC can alleviate deafness, and perform better than existing directional MAC protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348118","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, 2004.

Specifically, we investigate the possibility of putting various components on LAN switches to sleep during periods of low traffic activity. Traffic collected in our LAN indicates that there are significant periods of inactivity on specific switch interfaces. Using an abstract sleep model devised for LAN switches, we examine the potential energy savings possible for different times of day and different interfaces (e.g., interfaces connecting to hosts to switches, or interfaces connecting switches, or interfaces connecting switches and routers). Algorithms developed for sleeping, based on periodic protocol behavior as well as traffic estimation are shown to be capable of conserving significant amounts of energy. Our results show that sleeping is indeed feasible in the LAN and in some cases, with very little impact on other protocols. However, we note that in order to maximize energy savings while minimizing sleep-related losses, we need hardware that supports sleeping.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348125","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, 2004.

The aggregated load patterns of single-house customers have been first computed by using a bottom-up approach. Then, the time-dependent uncertainty of the aggregated load power has been assessed from simulations in function of the number of residential customers. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis has shown that a Gamma probability distribution, with parameters related to average value and standard deviation of the simulation results, satisfactorily represents the probability distribution of the load power at each time instant.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2004.1348210","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference (IEEE Cat.

An enterprise application running on a grid is composed of a set of SLA-constrained sub-tasks demanding different types of services and resources such as processors, data storage, service providers, and network links. The paper formalizes the resource allocation problem for SLA-constrained grid applications. The paper considers a very general case in which applications are decomposed into tasks that exhibit precedence relationships. The problem consists in finding the optimal resource allocation that minimizes total cost while preserving execution time service level agreements (SLAs).

The suggested system utilizes spread spectrum to divide the channel bandwidth into parallel codechannels, and allows for a number of mobile terminals to share the medium in a more fair and efficient way.

However, it is well known that the optimal set of options to be turned on is dependent on both the application and the target architecture. In many cases, standard settings, like -O3, produce suboptimal results due to negative interference of some of the options they contain. We propose an automatic iterative procedure to turn on or to turn off compiler options. This procedure is based on orthogonal arrays that are used for a statistical analysis of profile information to calculate the main effect of the options. We show that our approach outperforms -O3 of GCC on six SPEC benchmarks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOT.2004.1348305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29647","publicationTitle":"The IEEE Computer Society's 12th Annual International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems, 2004.

However, current technology allows for a relatively small amount of NVRAM, limiting the effectiveness of such an approach. We have developed a prototype in-memory file system which utilizes data compression on inodes, and which has preliminary support for compression of file blocks. Our file system, MRAMFS, is also based on data structures tuned for storage efficiency in non-volatile memory. This prototype allows us to examine how to use this limited resource more efficiently. Simulations show that inodes can be reduced to 15-20 bytes each at a rate of 250,000 or more inodes per second. This is a space savings of 79-85% over conventional 128-byte inodes. Our prototype file system shows that for metadata operations, inode compression does not significantly impact performance, while significantly reducing the space used by inodes. We also note that a naive block-based implementation of file compression does not perform acceptably either in terms of speed or compression achieved.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.2004.1348317","publicationTitle":"The IEEE Computer Society's 12th Annual International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems, 2004.

Most traditional radiosity methods subdivide the surfaces of objects into small elements such as quadrilaterals. However, the point-sampled geometry includes no explicit information about surfaces, presenting a difficulty in applying the traditional approach to the point-sampled geometry. The proposed method addresses this problem by computing the inter reflection without reconstructing any surfaces. The method realizes lighting simulations without losing the advantages of the point-sampled geometry.","doi":"10.1109/PCCGA.2004.1348345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCGA.2004.1348345","startPage":"152","endPage":"159","displayPublicationTitle":"12th Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications, 2004.

Research demonstrated that even for unstructured grids peak performances of millions of tetrahedra per second can be achieved by exploiting the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs. In this paper we present a hardware-accelerated solution that further improves the extraction performance. In contrary to existing approaches, our technique explicitly extracts the isosurface geometry in a fragment program by rendering only a single screen-sized quadrilateral. The extracted geometry is directly written to an on-board graphics memory object allowing for direct rendering without further bus transfers. Additionally, the geometry can be manipulated by shader programs or read back to the application for further processing. Examples and application scenarios are given that can benefit from our approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-accelerated reconstruction of polygonal isosurface representations on unstructured grids","publicationTitle":"12th Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications, 2004.

It starts, prior to realtime simulation, by analyzing cloth behavior in relation to the underlying skeleton movement from a pre-simulated sequence of the cloth obtained using any high quality offline simulators. The idea is to use this analysis to find an optimal combination of physics-based simulation and geometric approximation of the simulator; potentially colliding regions are defined on the cloth such that they will hold true for the skeleton movement that closely matches that of pre-simulated sequence. At runtime, using these analyses, our simulation process provides both visually pleasing results and performance, as long as the motion of the character remains sufficiently close to the original sequence used for the pre-computation. The key contributions of this paper are (1) efficient collision handling that prunes out potentially colliding objects by using the off-line simulation sequence as examples; (2) data-driven fix-up process for the coarse mesh simulation that deduces the gross behavior of the cloth; and (3) geometric approximation of the fine mesh deformation, responsible for details in the shape of the cloth such as wrinkles.","doi":"10.1109/PCCGA.2004.1348356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCGA.2004.1348356","startPage":"257","endPage":"266","displayPublicationTitle":"12th Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications, 2004.

On the other hand several solutions were proposed for the detection of rotor speed of induction motor for sensorless control. Another deeply investigated field of research is the detection of supply frequency of power lines, for the diagnosis of the distribution network. A common root of these three key topics is the need of accurately stating specific spectrum frequencies. Several techniques were presented in the literature in order to perform accurate tracking of frequencies for different purposes. They are modified versions of the traditional discrete Fourier transformation (DFT), or novel spectrum estimation techniques. This paper presents a novel procedure based on the statistical analysis of the current signal in the time domain, referred to as maximum covariance method for frequency tracking (MCMFT), that allows to obtain high frequency resolution accuracy independently of the sampling frequency and of the time acquisition period. Therefore those spectrum lines related to supply frequency or to slip can be detected with extreme accuracy within a wide range of sampled data conditions. Then either an accurate diagnosis of the machine electric faults or sensorless control, or distribution network diagnosis can be performed. Comparison between the proposed method and the literature are reported, in order to critically analyze its performances. An induction machine with two artificially broken bars was used for the experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348497","startPage":"743","endPage":"749 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29650/01348497.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring of induction machines by maximum covariance method for frequency tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring of induction machines by maximum covariance method for frequency tracking","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1348497/","accessionNumber":"8213368","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348497/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring of induction machines by maximum covariance method for frequency tracking","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048785S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29650","articleId":"1348497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1348502,"authors":[{"name":"D.

For the three-cell FCMI, four levels of operation are expected if the traditional ratio of the capacitor voltages is 1:2:3. However, by altering the ratio, the inverter can operate as a five-, six-, seven-, or eight-level inverter. According to previous research, the eight-level case is referred to as maximally distended (or full binary combination schema) since it utilizes all possible transistor switching states. However, this case does not have enough per-phase redundancy to ensure capacitor voltage balancing under all modes of operation. In this paper, redundancy involving all phases is used along with per-phase redundancy to improve capacitor voltage balancing. It is shown that the four- and five-level cases are suitable for motor drive operation and can maintain capacitor voltage balance under a wide range of power factors and modulation indices. The six-, seven-, and eight-level cases are suitable for reactive power compensation in applications such as static var compensation.

The design method employs a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization routine that can be implemented off-line and on-line. A suitable user definable fitness function assesses the performance of several control parameters, and selects which values will evolve to the next generation. Evolution over many generations evaluates a wide range of controller structures and values, and ultimately determines which one best achieves the control goals. Simulation and experimental results carried out using as applications an active filter and an induction motor drive show that the method produces an excellent controller design, but equally importantly, the design is carried out with very little user interaction. As such the design method is attractive to commercial manufacturers, as it can significantly reduce commissioning times.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348514","startPage":"864","endPage":"871 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29650/01348514.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line and off-line control design in power electronics and drives using genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control design","Power electronics","Genetic algorithms","Design methodology","Automatic control","Control systems","Design optimization","Automatic generation control","Induction generators","Active filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","genetic algorithms","power electronics","induction motor drives","active filters","digital control","machine control","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","power electronic","automated control system","GA","fitness function","active filter","induction motor drive"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"On-line and off-line control design in power electronics and drives using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1348514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8213385","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line and off-line control design in power electronics and drives using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100431S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"29650","articleId":"1348514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1348532,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunbae Kim","affiliation":["Digital Appliances Research and Development, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyunbae Kim","id":"37280361800"},{"name":"R.D.

Rotor position can be identified at standstill and higher speeds by using one of two spatial saliency based high frequency carrier signal injection methods: rotating vector in the stationary frame or pulsating vector in the estimated rotor frame. Carrier currents for both rotating and pulsating voltage carrier injection are derived by using an IPMSM model for high frequency. An appropriate carrier signal extraction and a spatial saliency tracking scheme for both injection methods are developed for robust sensorless control. By interfering with the spatial saliency, saturation-induced saliencies act as disturbances to the rotor position estimation.

The conditions for optimal flux weakening can be achieved while simultaneously delivering sinusoidal back-emf waveforms and low cogging torque. A closed-form analytical model is described that can be used to design SPM machines to achieve optimal flux weakening conditions. This technique is applied to design a 6 kW SPM machine that achieves constant-power operation over a wide speed range.

This configuration results in sinusoidal output voltages with step modulation and fundamental frequency switching. The proposed configuration has reduced conduction loss and switching loss. Simple gate drive circuit is designed using commonly available integrated circuit components. The simulation results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348560","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29650/01348560.pdf","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1171 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fifteen level inverter for photovoltaic power supply system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1348560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348560/","displayDocTitle":"A novel fifteen level inverter for photovoltaic power supply system","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8213431","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1348560/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fifteen level inverter for photovoltaic power supply system","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063117S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"29650","articleId":"1348560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1348567,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Experimental results for an automated material handling system based on a modified controller area network (CAN 2.0b) protocol with a feedback motion control system are presented. These results demonstrate the benefits of TEP compared to conventional sampled data systems implemented with TTP/C.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Networked control systems","Sampling methods","Communication system control","Protocols","Automatic control","Control systems","Motion control","Mission critical systems","Computer networks","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controller area networks","control engineering computing","materials handling","motion control","feedback","decentralised control","protocols","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networked control systems","Lebesgue sampling","network communication method","mission-critical real-time computer controlled processes","timed event architecture","timed event protocol","communication bus","automated material handling system","controller area network","feedback motion control system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348567","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29650/01348567.pdf","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1216 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved operation of networked control systems using Lebesgue sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1348567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved operation of networked control systems using Lebesgue sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348567/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1348567/","accessionNumber":"8221871","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved operation of networked control systems using Lebesgue sampling","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060019S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"29650","articleId":"1348567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1348589,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The low frequency beat can lead to increased voltage and current harmonics, voltage errors, and even voltage regulation issues at high modulation index region.

For many of these applications it is desirable to have LEDs in parallel. Because forward conduction characteristics vary considerably in for one device to another there is a problem with current sharing in parallel connected LEDs. This paper proposes a new circuit to regulate current in parallel LEDs. The circuit uses a capacitor in series with sets of antiparallel connected LEDs to control the current flow in each of the branches. The circuit is driven with a high frequency voltage generated by a resonant converter. Experimental results show large reductions in current differences between parallel connected LEDs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348696/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","volume":"3","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8191175","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1348696/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Parallel connected LEDs operated at high to improve current sharing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel connected LEDs operated at high to improve current sharing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026224S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"29651","articleId":"1348696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1348734,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Different from the conventional high power devices which require the external power input for their gate drivers, SPETO achieves optically controlled turn-on and turn-off, and all the internal power required is self-generated. Low loss gate drive circuit is implemented which allows the simple power-up operation. During normal switching operation, SPETO obtains power for the gate drive during its turn-on operation. SPETO also maintains the reported advantages of ETO such as the high switching frequency capability (over 2 kHz), large snubberless turn-off capability (5000 A/2800 V), low conduction and switching losses, and easy for series and parallel operation. SPETO greatly reduces the cost and increase the reliability of the power converters since no external power supply for device gate drive is required. SPETO is therefore suitable for the high power high frequency voltage source converter applications. Novel switching strategy is also introduced to minimize the gate drive power requirement.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348734","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29651/01348734.pdf","startPage":"1940","endPage":"1946 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29651","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1348734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPETO: a superior power switch for high power, high frequency, low cost converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348734/","displayDocTitle":"SPETO: a superior power switch for high power, high frequency, low cost converters","isConference":true,"volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1348734/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8191213","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPETO: a superior power switch for high power, high frequency, low cost converters","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06242S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"29651","articleId":"1348734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1348755,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Young Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Changwon Nat\u2019l University, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ji-Young Lee","id":"37292746900"},{"name":"Jung-Pyo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Changwon Nat\u2019l University, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung-Pyo Hong","id":"37289921800"},{"name":"Do-Hyun Kang","affiliation":["Mechatronics Research Group, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Do-Hyun Kang","id":"37289144000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8486-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"1348755","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":538},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Permanent magnet motors","Coupling circuits","Finite element methods","Magnetic circuits","Reluctance motors","Magnetic flux","Inductance","Analytical models","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","linear motors","finite element analysis","electromagnetic devices","electromagnetic fields","magnetic flux","magnetic circuits","inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet","PM","transverse flux linear motor","2D finite element method","3D equivalent magnetic circuit network method","electromagnetic devices","powerful linear motion","longitudinal motors","3D analysis","magnetic field analysis","static thrust","flux linkage","apparent inductance","incremental inductance"]}],"abstract":"Permanent magnet (PM) type transverse flux linear motors (TFLMs) are electromagnetic devices which can develop directly powerful linear motion.

Basically, it uses two multilayer perceptron (MLP) type neural networks. The first ANN uses the amplitude and angle of the reference voltage vector to determine the nearest three vectors (NTV) of the inverter by identifying the triangle wherein the reference vector lies. The second ANN is used to calculate the duty cycles of the three space vectors. An erasable programmable logic device (EPLD) synthesizes the PWM waves. The main advantages of this approach are the fast and simple implementation of the highly complex SVM algorithm for multilevel inverters without loosing precision compared to the conventional DSP-based SVM algorithm. Performance of the inverter using the proposed ANN-based SVM has been investigated extensively, and the results are found to be excellent. The principle described in the paper can be easily extended to an inverter with higher number of levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348779/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8231546","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1348779/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural-network-based space vector PWM of a five-level voltage-fed inverter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural-network-based space vector PWM of a five-level voltage-fed inverter","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077849S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"29652","articleId":"1348779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1348780,"authors":[{"name":"Gun-Tae Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gun-Tae Park","id":"37087742259"},{"name":"Tae-Jin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae-Jin Kim","id":"37087159217"},{"name":"Dae-Wook Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae-Wook Kang","id":"37087159352"},{"name":"Dong-Seok Hyun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Seok Hyun","id":"37087159765"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8486-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"1348780","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Power system reliability","Power electronics","Construction industry","Defense industry","Electrical equipment industry","Electronics industry","Fault tolerance","Power generation economics","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","reliability","fault tolerance","redundancy","electric current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power electronics system reliability","industrial application","commercial application","military application","optimal remedial strategy","fault tolerance","sinusoidal phase current","constant amplitude","redundancy technique","NPC inverter control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1348780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control method of NPC inverter for continuous operation under one phase fault condition","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348780","startPage":"2188","endPage":"2193 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29652/01348780.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348780","abstract":"The reliability of power electronics system is very important in industrial, commercial and military applications, Some applications have a need of high reliability.

First, resultant theory is applied to transcendental equations to eliminate low order harmonics and to determine switching angles for the fundamental frequency switching techniques. Next the magnitudes and phases of the residual higher order harmonics are computed, generated, and subtracted from the original voltage waveform to eliminate these higher order harmonics. The simulation results show that the method can effectively eliminate the specific harmonics, and a low total harmonic distortion (THD) near sine wave is produced. An experimental 11-level H-bridge multilevel converter with a first-on, first-off switching strategy, which is used to balance loads between several levels, is employed to validate the method.

The PV generation system is characterized by two controllers, namely, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller which makes it possible to take the maximum power which solar arrays can generate at any time irrespective of the weather, and a controller which quickly charges the maximum power obtained by the MPPT control to series connected ultraelectric double layer capacitors (ultraEDLCs) while maintaining the electric capacity which solar arrays can generate at that time. The MPPT controller controls the output current of the solar arrays so that the output power converges on the maximum power in the prediction line previously determined based on the linearity between the maximum output power and the optimal current. The MPPT controller is characterized by having the ability to enlarge the controllable range of the output power to lower solar radiation in comparison with the conventional hill-climbing method. The charging controller controls the current and voltage so as to be charged at around the power generated at that time while supervising the maximum voltage and allowable temperature of each series connected EDLC, The combined control method makes it possible to charge with the maximum power generation from solar arrays into ultraEDLCs. Effectiveness of the methods is verified by simulations and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348791","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29652/01348791.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348791","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","startPage":"2264","endPage":"2271 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A controlling method for charging photovoltaic generation power obtained by a MPPT control method to series connected ultraelectric double layer capacitors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1348791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A controlling method for charging photovoltaic generation power obtained by a MPPT control method to series connected ultraelectric double layer capacitors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348791/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1348791/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8231558","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A controlling method for charging photovoltaic generation power obtained by a MPPT control method to series connected ultraelectric double layer capacitors","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049859S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"29652","articleId":"1348791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1348813,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

When using the principle of vector control, it is possible to achieve optimal operation of SyncRel motors for all loads and speeds. A suitable control strategy can be implemented to achieve maximum torque per ampere, high efficiency and maximum power factor. However, the control of a SyncRel motor is highly affected by both magnetic saturation and high iron losses. A new strategy to achieve maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) is proposed in this paper. The motor behavior under vector control is analyzed considering both saturation and iron losses. A simple relationship between the developed torque and d-axis current has been obtained for MTPA conditions. After experimental check, the obtained relation has been implemented in a vector control algorithm. The proposed control strategy has been successfully implemented with the aid of an experimental setup.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2004.1348813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2004.1348813","startPage":"2411","endPage":"2417 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9338/29652/01348813.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A maximum torque per ampere vector control strategy for synchronous reluctance motors considering saturation and iron losses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A maximum torque per ampere vector control strategy for synchronous reluctance motors considering saturation and iron losses","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1348813/","accessionNumber":"8231580","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1348813/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum torque per ampere vector control strategy for synchronous reluctance motors considering saturation and iron losses","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01348813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051856S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9338","isNumber":"29652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9338","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"29652","articleId":"1348813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1348842,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of ECE, FAMU and FSU College of Engineering, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Hui Li","id":"37087073500"},{"name":"P.

In this paper, we explore the potential of architectural techniques to reduce leakage through power-gating of execution units. This paper first develops parameterized analytical equations that estimate the break-even point for application of power-gating techniques. The potential for power gating execution units is then evaluated, for the range of relevant break-even points determined by the analytical equations, using a state-of-the-art out-of-order superscalar processor model. The power gating potential of the floating-point and fixed-point units of this processor is then evaluated using three different techniques to detect opportunities for entering sleep mode; ideal, time-based, and branch-misprediction-guided. Our results show that using the time-based approach, floating-point units can be put to sleep for up to 28% of the execution cycles at a performance loss of 2%. For the more difficult to power-gate fixed-point units, the branch misprediction guided technique allows the fixed-point units to be put to sleep for up to 40% more of the execution cycles compared to the simpler time-based technique, with similar performance impact. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that architectural techniques can be used effectively in power-gating execution units.","doi":"10.1109/LPE.2004.240756","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2004 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (IEEE Cat.

In addition, we perform a detailed working set analysis for various cache line update policies for placing lines in a drowsy state. The analysis presents a policy for an instruction cache and shows it is as good as or better than more complex schemes proposed in the past. Furthermore, as air alternative to using high-threshold devices to reduce the bitline leakage through access transistors in drowsy caches, we propose a gated bitline precharge technique. A single threshold process is now sufficient. The gated precharge employs a simple but effective predictor that almost completely hides any performance loss incurred by the transitions between sub-banks. A 64-entry predictor with 3 bits per entry reduces the run-time increase by 78%, which is as effective as previous proposals that used content addressable predictors with 40 bits per entry. Overall, the combination of the proposed techniques reduces the leakage power by 72% with negligible (0.4%) run-time increase.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-V/sub DD/ and single-V/sub T/ super-drowsy techniques for low-leakage high-performance instruction caches","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2004 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (IEEE Cat.

We assume that the configurable logic blocks of the FPGA can be programmed using either a high supply voltage (high-Vdd) or a low supply voltage (low-Vdd). We carry out the clustering procedure with the guarantee that the delay of the circuit under the general delay model is optimal, and in the meantime, logic blocks on the non-critical paths can be driven by low-Vdd to save power. We explore a set of dual-Vdd combinations to find the best ratio between low-Vdd and high-Vdd to achieve the largest power reduction. Experimental results show that our clustering algorithm can achieve power savings by 20.3% on average compared to the clustering result for an FPGA with a single high-Vdd.

In this work, we focus on the interaction between power consumption and reliability considering the on-chip data caches. First, we investigate the impact of two commonly used architectural-level leakage reduction approaches on the data reliability. Our results indicate that the leakage optimization techniques can have very different reliability behavior as compared to an original cache with no leakage optimizations. Next, we investigate on providing data reliability in an energy-efficient fashion in the presence of soft-errors. In contrast to current commercial caches that treat and protect all data using the same error detection/correction mechanism, we present an adaptive error coding scheme that treats dirty and clean data cache blocks differently. Furthermore, we present an early-write-back scheme that enhances the ability to use a less powerful error protection scheme for a longer time without sacrificing reliability. Experimental results show that proposed schemes, when used in conjunction, can reduce dynamic energy of error protection components in L1 data cache by 11% on average without impacting the performance or reliability.","doi":"10.1109/LPE.2004.240852","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2004 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (IEEE Cat.

The on-chip workload signifies the CPU clock cycles that are required to execute instructions in the CPU whereas the off-chip workload captures the number of external memory access clock cycles that are required to perform external memory transactions. When combined with a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to minimize the energy consumption, this workload decomposition method results in higher energy savings. The workload decomposition itself is performed at run time based on statistics reported by a performance monitoring unit (PMU) without a need for application profiling or compiler support. We have implemented the proposed DVFS with workload decomposition technique on the BitsyX platform, an Intel PXA255-based platform manufactured by ADS Inc., and performed detailed energy measurements. These measurements show that, for a number of widely used software applications, a CPU energy saving of 80% can be achieved for memory-bound programs while satisfying the user-specified timing constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling based on workload decomposition","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2004 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (IEEE Cat.

The task of island partition creation and level assignment have to be done simultaneously in a floorplanning context due to the physical constraints involved in the design process. This leads to a floorplanning problem formulation that is very different from the traditional floorplanning for ASIC-style design. In this paper, we define the problem of architecting voltage islands in core-based designs and present a new algorithm for simultaneous voltage island partitioning, voltage level assignment and physical-level floorplanning. Application of the proposed algorithm to a few benchmark and industrial examples is demonstrated using a prototype tool.

Then through a hardware-level optimization, an efficient filter bank structure is introduced that results in at least a factor of 4 power reduction and also a complexity reduction from 6.95GOPS to 1.73GOPS for the multi-rate filter bank over the baseline design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing power consumption and complexity in a programmable transmit filter bank for OFDM","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2004 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (IEEE Cat.

In particular, the use of energy consuming memory, SDRAM, has become burdensome in battery-powered embedded systems. Intuitively, though demand paging can be used to mitigate the increasing requirement of main memory size, its applicability should be deliberately elaborated since NAND flash memory has asymmetric operation characteristics in terms of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present an energy-aware demand paging technique to lower the energy consumption of embedded systems considering the characteristics of interactive embedded applications with large memory footprints. We also propose a flash memory-aware page replacement policy that can reduce the number of write and erase operations in NAND flash memory. With real-life workloads, we show the system-wide energy-delay product can be reduced by 15/spl sim/30% compared to the traditional shadowing architecture.","doi":"10.1109/LPE.2004.241161","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2004 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (IEEE Cat.

Actual measurements demonstrate that under several different channel conditions the space diversity receiver outperforms the original single-antenna receiver by up to 8 dB in SNR.","doi":"10.1109/APASIC.2004.1349464","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2004 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Advanced System Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2004 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Advanced System Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/9325/29636/01349464.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APASIC.2004.1349464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An OFDM WLAN baseband receiver with space diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1349464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1349464/","displayDocTitle":"An OFDM WLAN baseband receiver with space diversity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8083126","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1349464/","conferenceDate":"5-5 Aug. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An OFDM WLAN baseband receiver with space diversity","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01349464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055478S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9325","isNumber":"29636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9325","xplore-issue":"29636","articleId":"1349464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1349476,"authors":[{"name":"Yo-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yo-Sheng Lin","id":"37087218660"},{"name":"Chi Chen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi Chen Chen","id":"37087297629"},{"name":"Shey-Shi Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shey-Shi Lu","id":"37087200647"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8637-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1349476","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1349476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Wireless LAN","Gallium arsenide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Impedance matching","Output feedback","Transducers","Noise figure","Testing","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indium compounds","gallium compounds","gallium arsenide","bipolar analogue integrated circuits","bipolar MMIC","UHF amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","wireless LAN","transceivers","III-V semiconductors","integrated circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triple-band low noise amplifier","miniaturized monolithic low noise amplifier","wireless LAN applications","HBT technology","high gain","input matching","output matching","shunt-shunt feedback","multiband transceivers","high transducer gain","reverse isolation","cascade configuration","2.4 GHz","5.2 GHz","5.7 GHz","InGaP-GaAs"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design and experimental results of a 2.4/5.2/5.7 GHz triple-band low noise amplifier (LNA) achieved by switching between different base bias currents (I/sub B/) in use of InGaP/GaAs HBT technology for the first time.

When the number of sub-carriers in SF-OFDM scheme is small, the interference between adjacent sub-carriers is generated. The proposed algorithms eliminate this interference in parallel or sequential manner and obtain a considerable performance improvement over the conventional detection algorithm. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed detection algorithms was evaluated by the simulation. In the case of 2 transmit and 2 receive antennas, at BER=10/sup -4/ the proposed algorithms obtain about 3 dB gain. In the results of logic synthesis using 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, the proposed SF-OFDM-PIC and SF-OFDM-SIC symbol detectors are composed of 28K and 26K logic gates, respectively. Since the proposed algorithms cancel the interference caused by the small number of sub-carriers and provide an excellent diversity advantage, SF-OFDM scheme with the proposed algorithms can be a good solution for the systems with the small number of sub-carriers such as wireless LANs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2004 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Advanced System Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/9325/29636/01349485.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"325","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2004 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Advanced System Integrated Circuits","doi":"10.1109/APASIC.2004.1349485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APASIC.2004.1349485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1349485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol detection algorithm and implementation results for space-frequency OFDM transmit diversity scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","OFDM","CMOS logic circuits","Bit error rate","CMOS technology","Interference elimination","Receiving antennas","Gain","Detectors","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","fading channels","error statistics","wireless LAN","CMOS logic circuits","interference suppression","radio transmitters","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit diversity scheme","space-frequency OFDM","symbol detection algorithm","adjacent subcarrier interference","bit error rate","logic synthesis","CMOS technology","wireless LAN","parallel interference cancellation","sequential interference cancellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1349485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Symbol detection algorithm and implementation results for space-frequency OFDM transmit diversity scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1349485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8083140","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","conferenceDate":"5-5 Aug. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol detection algorithm and implementation results for space-frequency OFDM transmit diversity scheme","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01349485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092171S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9325","isNumber":"29636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9325","xplore-issue":"29636","articleId":"1349485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1349501,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Lin Ko","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Lin Ko","id":"37279882000"},{"name":"Ming-Ching Kuo","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Ching Kuo","id":"37270843400"},{"name":"Chun-Ming Hsu","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Ming Hsu","id":"37276771300"},{"name":"Chien-Nan Kuo","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Nan Kuo","id":"37068101400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8637-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1349501","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","GSM","Multiaccess communication","CMOS process","Power supplies","Gain measurement","Noise measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Noise figure","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","3G mobile communication","UHF mixers","UHF amplifiers","voltage-controlled oscillators","UHF oscillators","UHF integrated circuits","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF front-end receiver","CMOS dual-mode receiver","WCDMA","GSM900","DCS1800","low-IF receiver","zero-IF receiver","parallel LNA","down-conversion mixers","standard CMOS process","multi-band parallel architecture","analog transceivers","highly integrated receiver","30 mA","2.7 V"]}],"abstract":"A dual-mode, triple-band RF front-end receiver for GSM900, DCS1800 and WCDMA is presented.

The new architecture reduces the calculation cost of required data correlation significantly. Since the calculation of the correlation into a matched filter becomes quite large amount of operation, the large circuit scale and the high power consumption happen on a mobile system. Accordingly the low calculation cost has been demanded. The proposed matched filter applies two step correlation algorithm into the data processing. Therefore, the amount of the operation can be decreased. In addition, it is expected that the operation speed and the power consumption of a matched filter circuit module are improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1349514/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1349514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8083158","conferenceDate":"5-5 Aug. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"A design of parallel matched filter with low calculation cost","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design of parallel matched filter with low calculation cost","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01349514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096086S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9325","isNumber":"29636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9325","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"29636","articleId":"1349514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1349527,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We assume appropriate probability density functions (pdf) for relevant physical parameters of the complex scattering media. The impact of these parameters are discussed using the expression of the correlation function (CF) between each of the two sub-channels of the MIMO channel. The CF is decomposable into several components that describe spatial, temporal, and frequency characteristics of the MIMO communication system. Such a decomposition allows easier investigation and gives a better understanding of the full potential of MIMO wireless communications. The describing components do not always have closed-form expressions. Therefore, closed-form expressions are obtained for some special cases. In practice, a linear convex combination of the expressions from these cases can approximate almost any model of microcellular environments. The proposed model is a generalization of several existing models including the Jake's/Clark model.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Following unsupervised training, a supervised neural network, learning vector quantization (LVQ), is used to improve further the performance and accuracy of segmentation. In terms of efficiency, only rotationally invariant features are adopted. The experimental results show that improvements can also be achieved by a feature selection scheme.

We implemented three popular corner detectors, Plessy, Wang-Brady, and SUSAN, in software and compared them on the basis of their stability, accuracy, speed and computational requirements. The Plessy algorithm was found to have good stability and accuracy, but suffered from a large computational cost. The SUSAN method required the least computational resources and would therefore be suitable for implementation on a simple FPGA platform. However, it did not perform well on real world images. The Wang-Brady method was found to have better stability than SUSAN but worse than the Plessy algorithm while having a lower computational cost than Plessy and a higher cost than that for SUSAN. Despite the higher computational requirements, we conclude that the Plessy algorithm, because of its significantly better performance, is the most appropriate algorithm for hardware implementation.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349633","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

This paper deals with the power allocation strategies in the reverse-link of two-hop multimedia CDMA networks. In this envisioned network, the WTs (wireless terminals) which cannot establish a direct link with the BS (at the required rates) seek the assistance of those WTs which can; in other words, whenever needed, some WTs are used as relayers for some other WTs (relayees) if this is possible. In a two-hop link, the first hop (relayee to relayer) uses the unlicensed band and the second hop (relayer to BS) uses the cellular band. This arrangement not only guarantees that no additional expensive cellular spectrum will be used to facilitate a two-hop link, but it also guarantees that if anything goes wrong in the first hop, this will not affect the performance of the WTs which directly communicate with the BS in the cellular band. The performance of any CDMA network depends on the implementation of a good power allocation and control scheme. The optimum power allocation and control in the reverse link of the conventional single-hop CDMA networks is well known. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a good power allocation scheme (which is tied to the proper selection of relayers) in the first hop of the two-hop reverse-link of the envisioned CDMA network. It is worth emphasizing that the nature of the reverse-link power allocation problem is very different in the many one-to-one links (or possibly numerous several-to-one links) which collectively constitute the first hop of the two-hop CDMA network under consideration, in comparison to that in the single many-to-one link in the reverse link of a conventional single-hop CDMA network. The simulation results show that the two-hop relaying, facilitated with the developed novel power allocation scheme, yields considerable enhancements in the CDMA cell capacity, coverage, and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349638","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

To account for the hardware limitations of portable mobile terminals, a low complexity version of the estimator is introduced and incorporated in the receiver structure. Based on the per-path SIR estimates, a new finger assignment algorithm (FAA) is proposed and compared to the conventional energy-based FAA. We show that the proposed FAA exhibits an improved multipath detection capability.

This versatility is due in part to coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM). OFDM can provide large data rates with sufficient robustness to radio channel impairments. During the deployment of terrestrial DTV broadcasting systems, very often the channel characteristics have to be captured for DTV coverage studies, reception problem diagnosis and service planning. The software implementation of a new channel characterization technique using a frequency domain pilot time domain correlation (FPTC) method for DVB-T systems is presented. This technique exploits the pilot sequence embedded in the DVB-T signal, which is derived from the frequency domain pilots and known to the receiver. The major advantages of this proposal, compared to other DTV channel characterization techniques, are its wide amplitude dynamic range, robustness to frequency synchronization errors, and avoidance of interruptions to the broadcasting service.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29682","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1346 Vol.3","pdfPath":"/iel5/9317/29682/01349648.pdf","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The resultant system is multivariable with effective interactions among its state variables, Therefore, multivariable control strategies and techniques are expected to considerably improve its performance in simultaneously controlling the flow of power and the dc side voltage. In this paper, the concept of parameterize pre-compensator technique from multivariable theory is employed to design an MIMO controller for this task. It is shown that the interactions among power flow and DC-link voltage dynamics are reduced considerably by this technique. Finally, the robustness of the proposed MIMO controller is investigated by perturbing some important power system parameters and variables around their nominal values.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349719","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1620 Vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

In power systems under transmission open access, an optimal schedule of generation of units to satisfy the demand at the minimum production and transmission costs with consideration of system operation constraints is an important issue. In this paper, a method for centralized economic dispatch in deregulated power systems is presented. The considered constraints are minimum and maximum power generation of units, capacity of transmission lines and ramp rate limits. A genetic algorithm is used to solve a nonlinear objective function. Simulations are performed on an IEEE 30-bus test system and the results are analyzed and commented.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349721","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1628 Vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

Considering an amplitude modulated/frequency modulated (AM/FM) signal in presence of the zero-mean additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), MWL criterion is applied to track the amplitude and the frequency of the signal at the same time. The proposed AmpPLL consists of LTI filters, VCO, mixers and integrators, where the LTI filters are directly defined by the introduced window function. The proposed AmpPLL can be extended to demodulate jointly parameters of an incoming signal with more than one AM/FM component. Simulations show that the proposed AmpPLL is fast in tracking and has a small acquisition time. The proposed AmpPLL is also robust against the variations of the signal power and its phase. These characteristics suit the AmpPLL well for a wide range of applications where there is fading and jitter together.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349757","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1768 Vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

The modulation scheme generates improper complex multiple-access interference (MAI) and necessitates the use of WL receivers. Focus is on bandlimited pulse shapes and inherent cyclostationarity (CS) of the uncoded received signal. The enhanced WL receiver replaces the conventional chip-matched filter (CMF) with new filters that exploit the CS of the received signal through frequency-shifting. The proposed WL receiver is shown to outperform the classical strictly linear (SL) receiver when the interfering users are high-powered, which may exist to support high data rate services. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of the WL receiver over the SL receiver in output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349766","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

ASIC vendors use proprietary formals to describe technology cells and macro modules in conjunction with numerous translators to feed technology library data to electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Multiple formats are used to represent various aspects of the cells in the same technology library, such as behavior for simulation, timing parameters for synthesis, physical data for layout, noise parameters for signal integrity checks, etc. In addition, most of these are highly-tool oriented mere formats, and are not well-designed self-consistent grammars, and are hard to extend for new data models. In this paper we briefly discuss a library grammar that attempts to bridge the growing gap between new design rules and analysis required for high performance and complex design implementation, and accurate comprehensive modeling of library cells. Its modeling capability is equally applicable for large IP blocks and macro cells, thereby making it suitable for SoC designs as well.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Application specific integrated circuits","Integrated circuit technology","Electronic design automation and methodology","Feeds","Timing","Signal synthesis","Data models","Bridge circuits","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","system-on-chip","integrated circuit design","circuit CAD","industrial property","circuit simulation","computational linguistics","grammars","integrated circuit modelling","program interpreters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC design library format","application specific integrated circuit","predefined design cells","ASIC proprietary formals","technology cells","macro modules","translators","technology library data","electronic design automation tools","EDA","timing parameters","simulation","multiple library formats","physical data","layout","noise parameters","signal integrity checks","highly-tool oriented formats","self-consistent grammars","data model extension","library grammar","design rules","design implementation analysis","comprehensive library cell modeling","IP blocks","macro cells","SoC design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1349773","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349773","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1830 Vol.3","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

A number of situations in which passive and dynamic dielectric properties are traceable to nanometric interfacial properties are considered. It is also demonstrated that such interfaces are nanometric electromechanical (NEM) systems which acting collectively also explain piezoelectricity in macroscopic systems. Interfaces are naturally nanometric entities and must have a major role in the future development of nanotechnology.

Such materials were subjected to PDs using the IEC (b) electrodes for evaluation. Comparisons were made as to the surface roughness observed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. It was found that the change in the surface roughness is far smaller in specimens with nanofillers than those without nanofillers, and that the 2 wt% addition is sufficient for improvement of the surface roughness. Furthermore, it was elucidated that the difference of surface roughness of the degraded area due to PDs among the specimens originates from the difference in their crystalline structures. These results indicate that polyamide nanocomposite is more resistance to PDs than polyamide without nanofillers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/29684/01349788.pdf","startPage":"833","endPage":"839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2004.1349788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2004.1349788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1349788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface degradation of polyamide nanocomposites caused by partial discharges using IEC (b) electrodes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface discharges","Degradation","Nanocomposites","Partial discharges","IEC","Electrodes","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Atomic force microscopy","Scanning electron microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharges","filled polymers","nanocomposites","organic insulating materials","scanning electron microscopy","atomic force microscopy","surface roughness","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge degradation","PD degradation","polyamide","nanoscale filler","IEC electrode","scanning electron microscopy","atomic force microscopy","surface roughness","crystalline structure","electrical insulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1349788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Surface degradation of polyamide nanocomposites caused by partial discharges using IEC (b) electrodes","volume":"11","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1349788/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8153572","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface degradation of polyamide nanocomposites caused by partial discharges using IEC (b) electrodes","sourcePdf":"01349788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058293S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"29684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"29684","articleId":"1349788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1349920,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To this end, TL terminations are interpreted as the series connection of vertical down-leads (or risers) with lumped impedances attached to ground, and the interfering electric field is described as a plane wave. From the circuit standpoint, the overall structure is modeled as the cascaded chain of a uniform horizontally-shaped TL and two non-uniform vertically-shaped TL with terminal impedances. Closed-form expressions are derived for the current induced by the external field in the terminal loads. By comparing model predictions against the outputs of a full-wave solver it is shown that the proposed circuit model extends the conventional TL theory to wiring structures with vertically shaped terminations and with larger values of the height/length aspect-ratio. A low-frequency model and a statistical analysis of TL susceptibility are also developed.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2004.1349958","publicationTitle":"2004 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (IEEE Cat.

The paper describes the use of near-field scanning data, performed in a typical laboratory bench top environment, to predict radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) in a typical product environment. The product environment may include enclosures and apertures. The approach begins by acquiring sufficient near-field scanning data to allow representation of an unintentional radiating source by an equivalent surface current distribution. The equivalent current distribution is used as a source in numerical full wave modeling. The agreement between direct full wave simulation results and full wave simulation results using equivalent sources works well under certain assumptions.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2004.1349988","pdfPath":"/iel5/9324/29635/01349988.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (IEEE Cat.
