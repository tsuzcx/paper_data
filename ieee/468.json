The inter-metal dielectric (IMD) is deposited between metal layers to provide isolated capability to the device and separate the different metal layers, which are not necessary in conducting electricity. A good isolated capability will help the devices become more reliable and stable. The key problem in IMD layer is the occurrence of voids, which lead to electric leakage and cause wafer scrape. To overcome the void problem in the IMD process is difficult due to its complicated input-response relationship. In this study, the authors combined neural networks, genetic algorithms (GAs), and desirability function to optimize the IMD process. The implementation of the proposed approach was carried out in a semiconductor manufacturing company in Taiwan, and the results illustrated the practicability of the said approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4680042/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10357677","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4680042/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combining Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms for Optimizing the Parameter Design of Inter-Metal Dielectric Layer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms for Optimizing the Parameter Design of Inter-Metal Dielectric Layer","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"07-03-004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04981S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4680042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4680186,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Wang","firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087633894"},{"name":"Jiake Lv","firstName":"Jiake","lastName":"Lv","id":"37087853801"},{"name":"Chaofu Wei","firstName":"Chaofu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37087853354"},{"name":"Deti Xie","firstName":"Deti","lastName":"Xie","id":"37087853114"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4680186","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Neural networks","Load forecasting","Power system planning","Economic forecasting","Power system economics","Power system modeling","Power generation economics","Power system analysis computing","Regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","load forecasting","particle swarm optimisation","power system analysis computing","power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short term load forecasting","national power planning","regional power planning","hybrid particle swarm optimization neural network training algorithm","power system operation economics","cost-effective technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.1997","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04680186.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.1997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4680186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Neural Network Approach for Short Term Load Forecasting","abstract":"Short term load forecasting (STLF) plays a significant role in national/regional power planning and operation with insufficient electric energy increased need. The accuracy of the operation system, which is derived from the accuracy of the forecasting approach used, will determine the economics of the operation of the power system. Conventional methods including time series, regression analysis or ARMA model entail exogenous input together with a number of assumptions. The use of neural networks has been shown to be a cost-effective technique. But their training, usually with back-propagation algorithm or other gradient algorithms, is featured with some drawbacks such as very slow convergence and easy entrapment in a local minimum. This paper presents a hybrid approach of neural network with particle swarm optimization training algorithm for developing the accuracy of predictions. The approach is applied to forecast daily peak loads (maximum of load during the day) of the Beibei, Chongqing electricity system based on previous data available for electricity demand. Traditional ARMA model and BP neural network are investigated as comparison basis. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve better prediction performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4680186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10357821","htmlLink":"/document/4680186/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Neural Network Approach for Short Term Load Forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Neural Network Approach for Short Term Load Forecasting","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"08-01-054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063772S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4680186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4680341,"authors":[{"name":"Linqi Gao","affiliation":["School of Management, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjian, China","School of Management, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjian, China","School of Management, Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Linqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37711086500"},{"name":"Congdong Li","affiliation":["School of Management, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Congdong","lastName":"Li","id":"37536359200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4680341","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4680341","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Recommender systems","Collaboration","Electronic commerce","Filtering algorithms","Predictive models","Simulated annealing","Books","Customer satisfaction","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer profiles","forecasting theory","genetic algorithms","marketing data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid personalized recommended model","genetic algorithm","hybrid model","weight vectors","forecasting performances","fitness function","forecasting accuracy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.2152","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04680341.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.2152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Personalized Recommended Model Based on Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"Amount of customer and product is huge and variant.

Evolutionary Algorithm Based on PSO and AFSA for Feedforward Neural Network Training","abstract":"In recent years, the multilayer feedforward neural network (FNN) has been received considerable attention and have been extensively used in many fields. Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation (LMBP) algorithm as an FNN training method has some limitations associated with overfitting, local optimum problems and slow convergence rate. In order to overcome the limitations, some people proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO) as an evolutionary algorithm to train the FNN. But PSO has disadvantages such as low precision, slow convergence in the later stage of the evolution, and parameter selection problems. In this paper, a novel hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on AFSA and PSO, also referred to as AFSA-PSO-parallel-hybrid evolutionary (APPHE) algorithm, has been used in FNN training. Compared to FNN trained by LMBP algorithm, FNN training by the novel hybrid evolutionary algorithm show satisfactory performance, converges quickly towards the optimal position, convergent accuracy, high stability and can avoid overfitting in some extent. FNN training by the novel method has been testified by using in Iris data classification and the results are much more accurate and stable than by Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4680707/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10349728","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4680707/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm Based on PSO and AFSA for Feedforward Neural Network Training","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm Based on PSO and AFSA for Feedforward Neural Network Training","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"10-01-011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067099S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4680707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4680711,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Bao Pang","affiliation":["Sch. of Civil Eng., Hebei Univ. of Technol., Tianjin"],"firstName":"Ming-Bao","lastName":"Pang","id":"37988124600"},{"name":"Guo-Guang He","affiliation":["Sch. of Civil Eng., Hebei Univ. of Technol., Tianjin"],"firstName":"Guo-Guang","lastName":"He","id":"37087987882"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4680711","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4680711","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Telecommunication traffic","Support vector machines","Neural networks","Intelligent transportation systems","Machine intelligence","Traffic control","Wavelet packets","Input variables","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","neural nets","pattern recognition","rail traffic","support vector machines","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos real-time recognition","traffic flow","support vector machine","rough neural network","intelligent transportation system","intelligent rapid recognition","wavelet packet energy","rough neurons"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.2522","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04680711.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.2522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaos Real-Time Recognition of Traffic Flow by Using SVM Rough Neural Network","abstract":"The real-time recognition problem of chaos in traffic flow was studied by using support vector machine(SVM) rough neural network.

In this paper, we propose a new optimistic concurrency control protocol called the timestamp vector based optimistic protocol, which can solve these problems and reduce more unnecessary restarts than time interval based OCC protocols. Experiments show that it outperforms time interval based OCC protocols.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concurrency control","Database systems","Access protocols","Transaction databases","Delay","System recovery","History","Educational institutions","Computer science","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","database management systems","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timestamp vector","optimistic concurrency control protocol","real-time databases","locking protocols","serialization order"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.2654","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04680843.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.2654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timestamp Vector Based Optimistic Concurrency Control Protocol for Real-Time Databases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4680843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timestamp Vector Based Optimistic Concurrency Control Protocol for Real-Time Databases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4680843/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4680843/","accessionNumber":"10349773","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timestamp Vector Based Optimistic Concurrency Control Protocol for Real-Time Databases","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"10-01-147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037898S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4680843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4681057,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Li Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Li","lastName":"Yang","id":"37876329400"},{"name":"Jing-Tian Tang","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jing-Tian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37653833200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4681057","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":666},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Electrocardiography","Frequency","Signal analysis","Narrowband","Filtering","Biomedical engineering","Biomedical signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","Hilbert transforms","medical signal detection","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hilbert-Huang transform","wavelet transform","ECG detection","signal processing","empirical mode decomposition","electrocardiogram","intrinsic mode functions","Physionet ECG database"]}],"abstract":"HHT (Hilbert transform) and wavelet transform are both signal processing methods.

It is an important factor that determines quality and cost of the product assembly. Cost in assembly can be reduced by the implementation of generating automatic product assembly sequences, and selecting the optimum sequence in product assembly process. Assembly sequence planning (ASP) is combinatorial problem. In recent years, some soft computing & intelligent algorithms have been used to solve ASP problems, and some achievements are arrived at. However, there are limitations for ASP. GA heavily depends on the choosing original sequence, which can result in early convergence in iterative operation, lower searching efficiency in evolutionary process, and non-optimization of final result for global variable. For simulated annealing algorithms, the principle of generating new sequence is exchanging position of the randomly selected two parts. Obviously, for complex products, a number of non-feasible solutions may appear, and the efficiency is low. In view of these limitations, the approaches of genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA), ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm and so on are used for the optimization of ASP. In this paper, the following contents about these two algorithms and the comparison are included. Firstly, the relevant researches on assembly sequence planning and the application of GA and SA are summarized. Next, the idea of two algorithms into genetic simulated annealing algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm are put forward individually. Thirdly, a case study is presented to validate the proposed two methods. The advantages and disadvantages are presented.

Since robots do not posses self-consciousness, estimation of adequate grasping force for individual objects by robots or manipulators is another challenge for wider applications of robots and manipulators. This article suggests a mathematical model, recently developed, for computation of scattered energy of vibrations sensed by the stylus during an object slippage in robot grippers. The model includes in it dynamic parameters like trial grasping force, object falling velocity, and geometry of object surface irregularities. It is envisaged that using the said mathematical model, with the help of robust decision making capabilities of artificial neural network (NN), a robot memory could be able to estimate appropriate/optimal grasping force for an object considering its physiomechanical properties. On the basis of above mentioned mathematical model, this article demonstrates an experimental methodology of estimating adequate grasping forces of an object by robot grippers using Backpropagation (BP) neural networks. Four different algorithms have been explored to experiment the optimal grasping force estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681378/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10396383","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681378/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Grasping Force Estimation Recognizing Object Slippage by Tactile Data Using Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grasping Force Estimation Recognizing Object Slippage by Tactile Data Using Neural Network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"RAMECH-08-00-72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049061S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664826","isNumber":"4681306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664826","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4681306","articleId":"4681378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4681408,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Qiaorong","affiliation":["College of Information, Henan University of Finance and Economics, Zhengzhou, China","College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Qiaorong","id":"37870998100"},{"name":"Gu Guochang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China","College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Gu","lastName":"Guochang","id":"37282946400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1675-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1676-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2181"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-219X"}],"articleNumber":"4681408","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Particle swarm optimization","Educational institutions","Mobile robots","Robot kinematics","Genetic mutations","Optimization methods","Orbital robotics","Switches","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","particle swarm optimisation","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","binary particle swarm optimization","mobile robot","mutation operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","Path Planning","Mobile Robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681408","abstract":"A new global path planning approach based on binary particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPSO) for a mobile robot is presented. The detailed realization of the approach is illustrated. The obstacles in the robot's environment are described as polygons and the vertexes of obstacles are numbered from 1 to n. Binary particle swarm optimization is used to plan the path. The length of the particle is the number of the vertexes. Every bit in the particle may be 1 or 0 which represents whether the vertex is in the path or not. To avoid converging too fast (the algorithm stops when the optimal path is not found), the algorithm is improved and the mutation operation is used. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness and practicability of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/RAMECH.2008.4681408","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664826/4681306/04681408.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"466","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMECH.2008.4681408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Planning Based on Improved Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Path Planning Based on Improved Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10396413","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4681408/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Planning Based on Improved Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"RAMECH-08-00-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036408S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664826","isNumber":"4681306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664826","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4681306","articleId":"4681408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4681421,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This estimation method requires significantly less number of timing measurements compared to the case where the dependence between the gate delays is not directly integrated within the estimation framework.

Monte Carlo methods are universally employed to validate the accuracy of the approximations made in all SSTA tools, but Monte Carlo itself is never employed as a strategy for practical SSTA. It is widely believed to be ldquotoo slowrdquo - despite an uncomfortable lack of rigorous studies to support this belief. We offer the first large-scale study to refute this belief. We synthesize recent results from fast quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) deterministic sampling and efficient Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) models of spatial correlation to show that Monte Carlo SSTA need not be slow.

Experiments with this sequential synthesis show effectiveness. When applied to a set of 20 industrial benchmarks ranging up to 26 K registers and up to 53 K 6 -LUTs, average reductions in register and area are 12.9% and 13.1% respectively while delay is reduced by 1.4%. When applied to the largest academic benchmarks, an average reduction in both registers and area is more than 30%. The associated sequential verification is also scalable and runs about 2times slower than synthesis.

The new source of variability, christened work-function variation (WFV), is caused by the dependency of metal work-function on the orientation of its grains. A statistical framework is developed, which enables estimation of the key parameters of work-function distribution by identifying the physical dimensions of the devices and properties of materials used in the fabrication. This paper offers three major contributions for process, device and circuit designers. First, the proposed model can be employed to identify suitable materials and fabrication processes that can reduce the impact of Vth fluctuation due to WFV. For instance, four types of metal nitride gate materials (TiN and TaN for NMOS and WN and MoN for PMOS devices) are studied and it is shown that TiN and WN result in lower Vth fluctuation. Second, device engineers can benefit from the result of this work by evaluating the WFV level of various types of classical or non-classical metal-gate CMOS transistors. As an example, it is shown that FinFET transistors are less affected by WFV compared to FD-SOI and bulk-Si devices due to their larger gate area. Third, circuit designers can utilize this model to investigate the impact of such a variation on the key performance and reliability parameters of the circuits. For instance, an SRAM cell is analyzed in the presence of V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n fluctuations due to WFV and it is shown that such variations can result in considerable performance and reliability degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681585.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical modeling of metal-gate Work-Function Variability in emerging device technologies and implications for circuit design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit synthesis","Fluctuations","Fabrication","Tin","MOS devices","Threshold voltage","Inorganic materials","FinFETs","Semiconductor device modeling","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","parameter estimation","statistical analysis","tantalum compounds","titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical modeling","metal-gate work-function variability","circuit design","random threshold voltage fluctuation","circuit-level implication","christened work-function variation","parameter estimation","work-function distribution","fabrication processes","NMOS","PMOS devices","nonclassical metal-gate CMOS transistors","FinFET transistor","reliability parameter","SRAM cell","TiN","TaN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Statistical modeling of metal-gate Work-Function Variability in emerging device technologies and implications for circuit design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681585/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394916","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical modeling of metal-gate Work-Function Variability in emerging device technologies and implications for circuit design","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063791S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4681592,"authors":[{"name":"Ranko Sredojevic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ranko","lastName":"Sredojevic","id":"37547955100"},{"name":"Vladimir Stojanovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37283724300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2819-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2820-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4681592","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Power system modeling","Equations","Circuit optimization","Circuits and systems","Phase locked loops","Decision feedback equalizers","Radio transmitters","Timing","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","network synthesis","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization-based framework","simultaneous circuit-and-system design-space exploration","high-speed link example","system-level performance models","analog-mixed-signal front-ends","channel filtering","top-level filter settings"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681592","abstract":"Connecting system-level performance models with circuit information has been a long-standing problem in analog/mixed-signal front-ends, like radios and high-speed links.

In this paper we introduce optimization-based framework for link design-space exploration, connecting the link transmission quality and top-level filter settings with circuit power, sizing and biasing. We derive a special analytical discrete time representation that avoids the size explosion of the symbolic problem description improving the parsing and solver time by orders of magnitude and making this joint optimization possible in real-time. This robust and accurate problem formulation is derived in signomial form and is compatible with existing optimization approaches to circuit sizing.

NTHU-Route 2.0 also successfully solves 12 of 16 ISPD08 benchmarks without causing any overflow.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NTHU-Route 2.0: A fast and stable global router","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681595","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681595.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"NTHU-Route 2.0: A fast and stable global router","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681595/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394926","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NTHU-Route 2.0: A fast and stable global router","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06664S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681601,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Dong","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dong","id":"37287161500"},{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37276871700"},{"name":"Garng M.

Conventional static noise margins (SNMs) are unable to capture nonlinear cell dynamics and become inappropriate for state-of-the-art SRAMs with shrinking access time and/or advanced dynamic read-write-assist circuits. Using the insights gained from rigorous nonlinear system theory, we define the much needed SRAM dynamic noise margins (DNMs). The newly defined DNMs not only capture key SRAM nonlinear dynamical characteristics but also provide valuable design insights. Furthermore, we show how system theory can be exploited to develop CAD algorithms that can analyze SRAM dynamic stability characteristics three orders of magnitude faster than a brute-force approach while maintaining SPICE-level accuracy. We also demonstrate a parametric dynamic stability analysis approach suitable for low-probability cell failures, leading to three orders of magnitude runtime speedup for yield analysis under high-sigma parameter variations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681601.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681601","startPage":"378","endPage":"385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM dynamic stability: Theory, variability and analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681601/","displayDocTitle":"SRAM dynamic stability: Theory, variability and analysis","htmlLink":"/document/4681601/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10394932","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM dynamic stability: Theory, variability and analysis","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103107S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4681604,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Gao","affiliation":["ESAT-MICAS, K.U.

In such cases, DPL requires that a layout feature be split into two parts.

We evaluate our technique on both real-world and artificially generated test cases in 45 nm technology.

However, in low-k1 lithography, especially at 45 nm and beyond, printing perfect polygons is practically impossible to achieve. In addition, prohibitively high mask complexity is incurred, leading to high mask cost. Given the impossibility of perfect printing, we argue that aiming to reduce the error of electrical discrepancy between the ideal and the printed contours is a more reasonable strategy. In fact, we show that contours with non-minimal EPE may result in closer match to the desired electrical performance. Towards achieving this objective, we developed a new electrically driven OPC (ED-OPC) algorithm. The tool combines lithography simulation with accurate electrical modeling of resist contours to predict the on/off current through a transistor gate. The computation of mask edge movements is cast as a linear program based on optical and electrical sensitivities. The objective is to minimize the error in saturation current between printed and target shapes. This optimization is then solved with fast runtime. The results on industrial 45 nm SOI layouts using high-NA immersion lithography models show up to a 5% improvement in accuracy of timing over conventional OPC. This is achieved at less than 26% runtime overheads, while also lowering mask complexity by up to 43%. The results confirm that better timing accuracy can be achieved despite larger edge placement error.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681617.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"479","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrically driven optical proximity correction based on linear programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Optical saturation","Optical sensors","Lithography","Resists","Printing","Predictive models","Runtime","Accuracy","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immersion lithography","linear programming","masks","proximity effect (lithography)","resists","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrically driven optical proximity correction","linear programming","edge placement errors","resist process","low-k1 lithography","mask complexity","lithography simulation","transistor gate","mask edge movements","saturation current","SOI layouts","high-NA immersion lithography models","timing accuracy","size 45 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electrically driven optical proximity correction based on linear programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681617/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394948","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrically driven optical proximity correction based on linear programming","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076783S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681625,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Liang Li","id":"37087189852"},{"name":"Evangeline F.

The obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (OARSMT) problem has become an important problem in the physical design stage of VLSI circuits. This problem has attracted a lot of attentions in research and several approaches have been proposed to solve this problem effectively. In this paper, we will present a heuristic maze routing based approach to solve this OARSMT problem. It is commonly believed that maze routing based approaches can only handle small scale problems and there is a lack of an effective multi-terminal variant to handle multi-pin nets in practice. We will show in this paper that maze routing based approaches can also handle large scale OARSMT problems effectively. Our approach is based on the searching process as in maze routing and can handle multi-pin nets very well in both solution quality, running time and memory space usage. We have compared our results with those of the previous works and can show that we can out-perform the best previous results on this problem [15] by giving an OARSMT with 2.01% less wire length on average and can make a 27.04% improvement in wire length in comparison with a lower bound of the optimal solution on average, while the running times are all very short and comparable to those in [15]. Besides, due to the flexibility of maze routing, we can handle different kinds of obstacles with different convex or concave rectilinear shapes directly without a need to partition each blockage into a set of rectangular sub-blockages, which will increase the size of the problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681625","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","startPage":"523","endPage":"528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681625.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Wire","Pins","Very large scale integration","Large-scale systems","Steiner trees","Circuits","Shape","Ant colony optimization","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit layout","network routing","trees (mathematics)","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree","VLSI circuits","heuristic maze routing","multipin nets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner tree construction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681625/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681625/","accessionNumber":"10394956","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner tree construction","confLoc":"San Jose, CA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097864S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4681628,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abdullah","lastName":"Al Faruque","id":"38180841700"},{"name":"Thomas Ebi","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ebi","id":"37542771700"},{"name":"Jorg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2819-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2820-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4681628","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Observability","Adaptive systems","Network-on-a-chip","Hardware","Monitoring","System-on-a-chip","Bandwidth","Routing","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","multiplexing","network routing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip systems","adaptive network on chip architecture","resource multiplexing","buffer utilization","buffer assignment scheme","router area","fixed buffer assignment scheme"]}],"abstract":"Hard-to-predict system behavior and/or reliability issues resulting from migrating to new technology nodes requires considering runtime adaptivity in future on-chip systems.

The hardware overhead is negligible, too, and is in fact less than the hardware savings due to resource multiplexing capabilities that are achieved through runtime observability/adaptivity. As an example, our on-demand buffer assignment scheme increases the buffer utilization and decreases the overall buffer requirements by an average of 42% (the buffer area amounts to about 60% of the entire router area [19]) in our case study analysis compared to a fixed buffer assignment scheme [7]. Our runtime observability on an average also increases the connection success rate by 62% compared to the case without runtime observability for the applications from the E3S benchmark suite [6].

Increasing power densities are making this problem more important. Characterizing the thermal profile of an IC quickly enough to allow feedback on the thermal effects of tentative design changes is a daunting problem, and its complexity is increasing. The move to nanoscale fabrication processes is increasing the importance of quantum thermal phenomena such as ballistic phonon transport. Accurate thermal analysis of nanoscale ICs containing hundreds of millions of devices requires characterization of thermal effects on length scales that vary by several orders of magnitude, from nanoscale quantum thermal effects to centimeter-scale cooling package impact. Existing chip.package thermal analysis methods based on classical Fourier heat transfer cannot capture nanoscale quantum thermal effects. However, accurate device-level modeling techniques, such as molecular dynamics methods, are far too slow for use in full-chip IC thermal analysis. In this work, we propose and develop ThermalScope, a multi-scale thermal analysis method for nanoscale IC design. It unifies microscopic and macroscopic thermal physics modeling methods, i.e., the Fourier and Boltzmann transport modeling methods. Moreover, it supports adaptive multi-resolution modeling. Together, these ideas enable efficient and accurate characterization of nanoscale quantum heat transport as well as chip.package level heat flow. ThermalScope is designed for full-chip thermal analysis of billion-transistor nanoscale IC designs, with accuracy at the scale of individual devices. ThermalScope enables accurate characterization of temperature-related effects, such as variation in leakage power and delay. ThermalScope has been implemented in software and used for full-chip thermal analysis and temperature-dependent leakage analysis of an IC design with more than 150 million transistors. It will be publicly released for free academic and personal use.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681639","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681639.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ThermalScope: Multi-Scale Thermal Analysis for Nanometer-Scale Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ThermalScope: Multi-Scale Thermal Analysis for Nanometer-Scale Integrated Circuits","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394970","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681639/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ThermalScope: Multi-Scale Thermal Analysis for Nanometer-Scale Integrated Circuits","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070355S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4681641,"authors":[{"name":"Ramkumar Jayaseelan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ramkumar","lastName":"Jayaseelan","id":"37662372500"},{"name":"Tulika Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tulika","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37282510200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2819-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2820-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4681641","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Voltage","Cooling","Packaging","Thermal management","Costs","Embedded system","Timing","Energy consumption","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware computing","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature aware task sequencing","voltage scaling","on-chip power density"]}],"abstract":"On-chip power density and temperature are rising exponentially with decreasing feature sizes. This alarming trend calls for temperature management at every level of system design. In this paper, we propose task sequencing as a powerful and complimentary mechanism to voltage scaling in improving the thermal profile of an embedded system executing a set of periodic heterogenous tasks under timing constraints. We first derive the peak temperature of a repeating task sequence analytically and develop a heuristic to construct the task sequence that minimizes the peak temperature. Experimental evaluation shows that our task sequencing heuristic achieves peak temperature within 0.5degC of the optimal solution and 7.47degC lower, on an average, compared to the worst sequence for a large range of embedded task sets. We also propose an iterative algorithm that combines task sequencing with voltage scaling to further lower the peak temperature while satisfying the timing constraints. For embedded task sets, our combined task sequencing and voltage scaling approach achieves, on an average, 2.1degC - 6.94degC reduction in peak temperature compared to voltage scaling alone.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature aware task sequencing and voltage scaling","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681641","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681641.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Temperature aware task sequencing and voltage scaling","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681641/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394972","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature aware task sequencing and voltage scaling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063809S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4681643,"authors":[{"name":"Reza M.

This trend makes the deviation between simulated path delay and actual path delay in a manufactured chip more significant. In this paper, we propose a new on-chip path delay measurement structure called path-based ring oscillator (Path-RO). The proposed method creates an oscillator from a targeted path for which it is used to measure path delay on-chip under the impact of process variations. To alleviate accuracy degradation caused by the architecture itself, a high-accuracy calibration process is presented. Through experimental results on Path-ROs inserted in ITCpsila99 b19 benchmark, we obtain path delay distribution under different process variations. The accuracy and efficiency of path delay measurement using Path-RO are also verified by comparing the results obtained from post-layout Hspice simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681644","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","startPage":"640","endPage":"646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path-RO: A novel on-chip critical path delay measurement under process variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Path-RO: A novel on-chip critical path delay measurement under process variations","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681644/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394975","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4681644/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path-RO: A novel on-chip critical path delay measurement under process variations","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087125S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681645,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Feng","id":"37291639000"},{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37276871700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2819-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2820-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4681645","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":543},"abstract":"The challenging task of analyzing on-chip power (ground) distribution networks with multi-million node complexity and beyond is key to todaypsilas large chip designs. For the first time, we show how to exploit recent massively parallel single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) based graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms to tackle power grid analysis with promising performance. Several key enablers including GPU-specific algorithm design, circuit topology transformation, workload partitioning, performance tuning are embodied in our GPU-accelerated hybrid multigrid algorithm, GpuHMD, and its implementation. In particular, a proper interplay between algorithm design and SIMT architecture consideration is shown to be essential to achieve good runtime performance. Different from the standard CPU based CAD development, care must be taken to balance between computing and memory access, reduce random memory access patterns and simplify flow control to achieve efficiency on the GPU platform. Extensive experiments on industrial and synthetic benchmarks have shown that the proposed GpuHMD engine can achieve 100times runtime speedup over a state-of-the-art direct solver and be more than 15times faster than the CPU based multigrid implementation. The DC analysis of a 1.6 million-node industrial power grid benchmark can be accurately solved in three seconds with less than 50 MB memory on a commodity GPU. It is observed that the proposed approach scales favorably with the circuit complexity, at a rate about one second per million nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681645.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"654","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multigrid on GPU: Tackling Power Grid Analysis on parallel SIMT platforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power grids","Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Runtime","Central Processing Unit","Network-on-a-chip","Chip scale packaging","Graphics","Performance analysis","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","distribution networks","network topology","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip power distribution networks","multimillion node complexity","single-instruction multiple-thread based graphics processing unit platforms","GPU-specinc algorithm design","circuit topology transformation","workload partitioning","performance tuning","GPU-accelerated hybrid multigrid algorithm","random memory access patterns","CPU based multigrid implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multigrid on GPU: Tackling Power Grid Analysis on parallel SIMT platforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394976","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multigrid on GPU: Tackling Power Grid Analysis on parallel SIMT platforms","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0957S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":4681648,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Majzoobi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Majzoobi","id":"37658445800"},{"name":"Farinaz Koushanfar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Farinaz","lastName":"Koushanfar","id":"37284705800"},{"name":"Miodrag Potkonjak","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Potkonjak","id":"37279233100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2819-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2820-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4681648","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":177,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":1159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Reverse engineering","Security","Delay lines","Embedded system","Feeds","Robustness","Design methodology","Circuits","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physically unclonable functions","multiple delay lines","statistical analysis","embedded systems","challenge input bits","PUF structures","security mechanisms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681648","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681648.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681648","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight secure PUFs","abstract":"To ensure security and robustness of the next generation of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), we have developed a new methodology for PUF design.

Finally, we show that existing PLB (programmable logic block) templates for area-aware Boolean matching and logic resynthesis are not effective for fault tolerance, and propose a new robust template with path re-convergence.

Until now, the most pervasive methods used to address reliability, involve injecting spare resources. However, these methods use predetermined spare placement that is not optimized for each netlist. This is the first work (to the best of our knowledge) that addresses the problem of fault tolerance for nano-FPGAs at the placement stage; fault tolerant placements are generated that are amenable to fast defect reconfiguration through replacement of defective logic elements with spares. We propose a simulated-annealing based placement algorithm that produces placements with the objective of maximizing the chances of successful recovery from faults in logic elements within the circuitpsilas timing constraints. In addition, our study of the fault reconfiguration problem shows it is NP-Complete, and we propose a fast scheme for achieving a good reconfiguration solution for a random or clustered fault map. Experimental results show that these techniques can increase the probability of successful fault reconfiguration by 55% (compared to a uniform spare distribution scheme), without significantly degrading the circuit performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394985","htmlLink":"/document/4681655/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerant placement and defect reconfiguration for nano-FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerant placement and defect reconfiguration for nano-FPGAs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078096S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681660,"authors":[{"name":"Fred Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Chen","id":"37335721800"},{"name":"Hei Kam","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hei","lastName":"Kam","id":"37397934800"},{"name":"Dejan Markovic","affiliation":["EE Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dejan","lastName":"Markovic","id":"37276553500"},{"name":"Tsu-Jae King Liu","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tsu-Jae King","lastName":"Liu","id":"38184487300"},{"name":"Vladimir Stojanovic","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37283724300"},{"name":"Elad Alon","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Elad","lastName":"Alon","id":"37270360800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2819-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2820-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4681660","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit synthesis","Digital relays","Energy efficiency","Semiconductor device modeling","Adders","CMOS integrated circuits","Hardware design languages","Integrated circuit measurements","CMOS logic circuits","Logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","hardware description languages","integrated circuit design","logic design","nanoelectromechanical devices","relays","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","NEM relays","CMOS transistors","nanoelectromechanical relays","Verilog-A model","VLSI system","digital-to-analog converters","analog-to-digital converters"]}],"abstract":"To overcome the energy-efficiency limitations imposed by finite sub-threshold slope in CMOS transistors, this paper explores the design of integrated circuits based on nano-electro-mechanical (NEM) relays. A dynamical Verilog-A model of the NEM relay is described and correlated to device measurements. Using this model we explore NEM relay design strategies for digital logic and I/O that can significantly improve the energy efficiency of the whole VLSI system. By exploiting the low effective threshold voltage and zero leakage achievable with these relays, we show that NEM relay-based adders can achieve an order of magnitude or more improvement in energy efficiency over CMOS adders with ns-range delays and with no area penalty. By applying parallelism, this improvement in energy-efficiency can be achieved at higher throughputs as well, at the cost of increased area. Similar improvements in high-speed I/O energy are also predicted by making use of the relays to implement highly energy-efficient digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681660","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670335/4681527/04681660.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681527","startPage":"750","endPage":"757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated circuit design with NEM relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated circuit design with NEM relays","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681660/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394990","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4681660/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated circuit design with NEM relays","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08725S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670335","isNumber":"4681527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670335","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4681527","articleId":"4681660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4681674,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Briz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4681674/4681674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fernando Briz (A'96\u2013M'99\u2013SM'06) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Oviedo, Gij\u00f3n, Spain, in 1990 and 1996, respectively.","From June 1996 to March 1997, he was a Visiting Researcher with the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

Printing allows the use of purely additive processing, thus lowering process complexity and material usage. Coupled with the use of low-cost substrates such as plastic, metal foils, etc., it is expected that printed electronics will enable the realization of a wide range of easily deployable electronic systems, including displays, sensors, and RFID tags. We review our work on the development of technologies and applications for printed electronics. By combining synthetically derived inorganic nanoparticles and organic materials, we have realized a range of printable electronic \u201cinks\u201d, and used these to demonstrate printed passive components, multilayer interconnection, diodes, transistors, memories, batteries, and various types of gas and biosensors. By exploiting the ability of printing to cheaply allow for the integration of diverse functionalities and materials onto the same substrate, therefore, it is possible to realize printed systems that exploit the advantages of printing while working around the disadvantages of the same.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2008.4681691","publicationTitle":"ESSDERC 2008 - 38th European Solid-State Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSDERC 2008 - 38th European Solid-State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669535/4681676/04681691.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2008.4681691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Printed electronics for low-cost electronic systems: Technology status and application development","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681691/","displayDocTitle":"Printed electronics for low-cost electronic systems: Technology status and application development","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681691/","conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Printed electronics for low-cost electronic systems: Technology status and application development","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084392S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669535","isNumber":"4681676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669535","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4681676","articleId":"4681691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681696,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Fischer","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Fischer","id":"38276127700"},{"name":"Ettore Amirante","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ettore","lastName":"Amirante","id":"37330218900"},{"name":"Karl Hofmann","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"37320544600"},{"name":"Martin Ostermayr","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Ostermayr","id":"37392959600"},{"name":"Peter Huber","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Huber","id":"37666398100"},{"name":"Doris Schmitt-Landsiedel","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Doris","lastName":"Schmitt-Landsiedel","id":"38270167300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2363-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2364-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8876"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"}],"articleNumber":"4681696","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":528},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681696","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Random access memory","Stress measurement","Negative bias temperature instability","Threshold voltage","Current measurement","Probability density function","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","MOSFET","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induced statistical variation","SRAM transistors","n-MOS transistors","p-MOS transistors","negative bias temperature instability","threshold voltage distributions","drain current distributions","probability density functions","Gaussian distribution","static noise margin","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"We present the results of a test structure that allows to measure the variation of SRAM p-MOS and n-MOS transistors in a dense environment and to apply Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) stress on the p-MOS transistors.

The proposed multi-physics model, which describes the electrical, the thermal, and the phase change behavior of the memory cell, can be implemented in a finite-element simulator, with no need for any external algorithm to compute the phase evolution. The goal of this work is to determine, from a macroscopic point of view, the morphological evolution of the phase distribution during the programming pulses. This is useful to investigate the programming conditions that lead, for example, to a series-type or to a parallel-type phase distribution. The proposed model has been validated by comparing the simulated and the experimental SET to RESET programming curve. Finally, the model allowed us to evaluate the different phase distributions obtained after the same programming pulse when starting from different initial RESET conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681676","publicationTitle":"ESSDERC 2008 -

The maximum power conversion efficiency is 52%, for a voltage conversion ratio of 0.46. This is a 12% improvement compared to a linear regulator. Higher values are likely to be reached using a converter with external components, which is not the case here. Stacked transistors are used to cope with the high voltage.

It operates by measuring the phase shift of an electrothermal filter (ETF), which is a function of the temperature-dependent thermal diffusivity of bulk silicon. Compared to previous work, this TDC employs an improved ETF, whose layout has been optimized to minimize the phase spread caused by lithographic inaccuracy. Furthermore, the TDCpsilas front-end consists of a gain-boosted transconductor, whose wide bandwidth minimizes electrical phase spread. The resulting current is then digitized by a phase-domain SigmaDelta modulator. The phase-subtracting node of the modulator is realized by a chopper demodulator, whose switching action, however, will give rise to a residual offset current. This is minimized by locating the demodulator at the virtual grounds of the transconductorpsilas gain boosting amplifiers. Any residual offset is then eliminated by chopping the entire front-end. Measurements on 16 samples show that the TDC has an untrimmed inaccuracy of less than plusmn0.4degC (3sigma) over the military range (-55degC to 125degC).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A temperature-to-digital converter based on an optimized electrothermal filter","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681795","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669531/4681770/04681795.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A temperature-to-digital converter based on an optimized electrothermal filter","conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681795/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394690","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A temperature-to-digital converter based on an optimized electrothermal filter","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11142008-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049884S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669531","isNumber":"4681770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669531","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4681770","articleId":"4681795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4681797,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsuk Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea","Graphics Memory Design Team, Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Icheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dongsuk Shin","id":"37533901300"},{"name":"Won-Joo Yun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea","Graphics Memory Design Team, Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Icheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Won-Joo Yun","id":"37267196600"},{"name":"Hyun-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyun-Woo Lee","id":"37280125400"},{"name":"Young-Jung Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Jung Choi","id":"37290815000"},{"name":"Suki Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suki Kim","id":"37279277500"},{"name":"Chulwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chulwoo Kim","id":"37292328500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2361-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2362-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"4681797","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1022},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681797","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Delay lines","Energy consumption","Jitter","Frequency","Pulse circuits","Open loop systems","Pulse width modulation converters","CMOS technology","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","convertors","delay lines","jitter","mixers (circuits)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-jitter all digital DLL","pulse width detection scheme","single-poly four-metal CMOS technology","open-loop time-to-digital converter","semi dual delay line","boundary switching problem","digital delay-locked loop","frequency 0.17 GHz to 1.4 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A wide-range low-jitter digital DLL using 0.18 um single-poly four-metal CMOS technology is proposed that uses an open-loop time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based DCC circuit with 10 cycles of maximum locking time by virtue of pulse width detection scheme.

For a transmitter chain, linear direct quadrature modulation architecture is introduced for both W-CDMA/HSDPA (high speed uplink packet access) and for GSM/EDGE. Analog baseband LPFs and quadrature modulators are commonly used both for GSM and for EDGE. For a direct conversion receiver chain, ABB (analog base-band) blocks, i.e., LPFs and VGAs, delta-sigma A/D converters, and FIR filters are commonly used for W-CDMA/HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access) and GSM/EDGE to reduce chip area. Their characteristics can be reconfigured by register-based control sequence. The receiver chain also includes high-speed DC offset cancellers both in analog and in digital stage, and the self-contained AGC controller, whose parameters such as time constant are programmable to be free from DBB (digital base-band) control. The transceiver also includes wide-range VCOs and fractional PLLs, an LVDS driver and receiver for high-speed digital interface of 312 MHz. Measured results reveal that the transceiver satisfies 3GPP specifications for W-CDMA/HSPA (high speed packet access) and GSM/EDGE.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681812","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669531/4681770/04681812.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681770","startPage":"142","endPage":"145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A single-chip 8-band CMOS transceiver for W-CDMA(HSPA) / GSM(GPRS) / EDGE with digital interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A single-chip 8-band CMOS transceiver for W-CDMA(HSPA) / GSM(GPRS) / EDGE with digital interface","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681812/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394707","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4681812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A single-chip 8-band CMOS transceiver for W-CDMA(HSPA) / GSM(GPRS) / EDGE with digital interface","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11142008-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088892S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669531","isNumber":"4681770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669531","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4681770","articleId":"4681812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4681813,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Cassia","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Cassia","id":"37269748100"},{"name":"Aristotele Hadjichristos","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aristotele","lastName":"Hadjichristos","id":"37282420100"},{"name":"Hong Sun Kim","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hong Sun Kim","id":"37578656800"},{"name":"Jin-Su Ko","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jin-Su Ko","id":"37065927600"},{"name":"Jeongsik Yang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jeongsik Yang","id":"38560079300"},{"name":"Sang-Oh Lee","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sang-Oh Lee","id":"37579199800"},{"name":"Kamal Sahota","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Sahota","id":"37352662200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2361-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2362-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"4681813","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Radio transmitters","Baseband","Band pass filters","GSM","Energy consumption","SAW filters","Batteries","CMOS technology","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS SAW-less quad band transmitter","low power quadband transmitter","multiband CMOS transmitter","power consumption","W-CDMA bands","GSM/EDGE operations"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a multi-band CMOS transmitter for cellular applications.

Use of composite word warrants a unique write operation where MECC updates checkbits by simultaneously writing one data word and reading the other three data words. Two composite words are interleaved in a row to tackle multi-bit SEU. In addition, the supply voltage of the SRAM is reduced to save leakage and active power. A 64kb SRAM with MECC implemented in 90nm CMOS technology consumes 154 muW leakage power and 375 muW active power at 0.6 V and 100 MHz, showing improved area and speed-power efficiency than conventional single-word ECC and existing multiword ECC schemes.","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669531/4681770/04681833.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiword based high speed ECC scheme for low-voltage embedded SRAMS","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multiword based high speed ECC scheme for low-voltage embedded SRAMS","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394728","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4681833/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiword based high speed ECC scheme for low-voltage embedded SRAMS","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11142008-00063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081861S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669531","isNumber":"4681770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669531","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4681770","articleId":"4681833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681834,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The SRAM module also uses body-bias control by column for further low-voltage operation, which is suitable for DVFS operation. A prototype SRAM module with body-bias control achieved 0.6-V operation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681770","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2008 - 34th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669531/4681770/04681848.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2008.4681848","startPage":"286","endPage":"289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cell-activation-time controlled SRAM for low-voltage operation in DVFS SoCs using dynamic stability analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681848/","displayDocTitle":"A cell-activation-time controlled SRAM for low-voltage operation in DVFS SoCs using dynamic stability analysis","htmlLink":"/document/4681848/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10394743","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cell-activation-time controlled SRAM for low-voltage operation in DVFS SoCs using dynamic stability analysis","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11142008-00078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072133S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669531","isNumber":"4681770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669531","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4681770","articleId":"4681848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681849,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Geens","affiliation":["ESAT-MICAS, K.U.

A related function is required for full fluidic control over the flow in the vascular microchannels (phloem) of plants. Evolution fulfilled this in the Fabaceae family through using reversibly swellable protein aggregates (forisomes). The swelling behavior is regulated in the vessels by calcium but is also pH dependent. In order to utilize the natural forisome elements in a technical chip application, we integrated the protein complexes into the channel system of a microflow cell. In this artificial environment, the reversible conformation change of the forisomes could be induced by varying the calcium concentration or by an electrically generated pH shift. In consequence, the swelling of the forisome reversibly blocked a microparticle flow in various branched and unbranched channel geometries. The regulation of the flow was successfully verified by detecting the particle flux while switching the valve and by impedance spectroscopy. In conclusion, forisome plant protein bodies are a valve element that can readily be integrated into microfluidics and can also be externally controlled to selectively retain objects that pass the channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4681904/04681910.pdf","startPage":"1322","endPage":"1328","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2008.2007241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2008.2007241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4681910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Biohybrid Microfluidic Valve Based on Forisome Protein Complexes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Valves","Proteins","Microchannel","Calcium","Actuators","Fluid flow control","Aggregates","Geometry","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric impedance","microchannel flow","molecular biophysics","proteins","swelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biohybrid microfluidic valve","forisome protein complexes","vascular microchannels","plants","Fabaceae family","swelling","microparticle flow","particle flux","impedance spectroscopy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biohybrid","contractile protein","forisome","microfluidics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Biohybrid Microfluidic Valve Based on Forisome Protein Complexes","volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4681910/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348098","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Biohybrid Microfluidic Valve Based on Forisome Protein Complexes","sourcePdf":"jmems-jaeger-2007241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090037S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4681904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4681904","articleId":"4681910","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681914,"authors":[{"name":"Said Emre Alper","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4681904/4681914/4681914-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Said Emre Alper was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1976.

The improved decoupling arrangement of the gyroscope enhances the robustness of sensing frame against drive-mode oscillations and therefore minimizes mechanical crosstalk between the drive and sense modes, yielding a small bias instability. The gyroscope core element is fabricated by through-etching a 100-mum -thick silicon substrate which is anodically bonded to a recessed glass handling substrate. A patterned metal layer is included at the bottom of the silicon substrate, both as an etch-stop layer and a heat sink to prevent heating- and notching-based structural deformations encountered in deep dry etching in the silicon-on-glass process. The fabricated-gyroscope core element has capacitive actuation/sensing gaps of about 5 mum yielding an aspect ratio close to 20, providing a large differential sense capacitance of 18.2 pF in a relatively small footprint of 4.6 mm times 4.2 mm. Excitation and sensing electronics of the gyroscope are constructed using off-the-shelf integrated circuits and fit in a compact printed circuit board of size 54 mm times 24 mm. The complete angular rate sensor system is characterized in a vacuum ambient at a pressure of 5 mtorr and demonstrates a turn-on bias of less than 0.1 deg/s, bias instability of 14.3 deg/h, angle random walk better than 0.115 deg/radic(h), and a scale-factor nonlinearity of plusmn0.6% in full-scale range of plusmn50 deg/s.

Both the design of fuzzy-PID (FPID) controller and its integration with the conventional PID in global control system to produce a hybrid design are demonstrated. A genetic optimization technique is used to determine the optimal values of the scaling factors of the output variables of the FPID controller. The objective is to utilize the best attributes of the PID and FPID controllers to provide a controller which will produce better response than either the PID or FPID controller. The principle of the hybrid controller is to use a PID controller, which performs satisfactorily in most cases, while keeping in the background a FPID controller, which is ready to take over the PID controller when severe disturbances occur. The hybrid controller is formulated and implemented in real time, using the speed control of a brushless drive system as a testbed. The design, analysis, and implementation stages are carried out entirely using a dSPACE DS1104 digital-signal-processor-based real-time data acquisition control system and MATLAB/Simulink environment. Experimental results show that the proposed FPID controller-based genetic optimization produces better control performance than the conventional PID controllers, particularly in handling nonlinearities and external disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.2006347","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4681924/04681929.pdf","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1986","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.2006347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP-Based Laboratory Implementation of Hybrid Fuzzy-PID Controller Using Genetic Optimization for High-Performance Motor Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"DSP-Based Laboratory Implementation of Hybrid Fuzzy-PID Controller Using Genetic Optimization for High-Performance Motor Drives","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10313256","publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4681929/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP-Based Laboratory Implementation of Hybrid Fuzzy-PID Controller Using Genetic Optimization for High-Performance Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tia-rubaai-2006347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128055S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4681924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4681924","articleId":"4681929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4681935,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Stefani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4681924/4681935/4681935-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Stefani was born in Bologna, Italy, in 1976.

Data centers call for electric power with high availability, and a possibility to reduce the electric losses and, consequently, the need for cooling. High reliability can be achieved by using local energy sources, and by using a dc power system, the number of conversion steps, and therefore also the losses, can be reduced. The dc microgrid can also supply closely located sensitive ac loads during outages in the ac grid. The proposed dc microgrid can be operated in eight different operation modes described here, resulting in 23 transitions. The control system coordinates the operation of converters, sources, and switches used in the dc microgrid. The control system is tested in the simulation software package PSCAD/EMTDC, and the results of the most interesting transitions are presented. The results show that it is possible to use the proposed dc microgrid to supply sensitive electronic loads and also, during ac-grid outages, supply closely located sensitive ac loads. To reduce the current transients experienced by grid-connected ac/dc converters, fast grid-outage detection and fast switches are required.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.2006398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4681924/04681939.pdf","startPage":"1910","endPage":"1917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.2006398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Control System for a DC Microgrid for Data Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Control System for a DC Microgrid for Data Centers","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10323760","htmlLink":"/document/4681939/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Control System for a DC Microgrid for Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tia-salomonsson-2006398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070702S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4681924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"227","xplore-issue":"4681924","articleId":"4681939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4681946,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Hee Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Kyongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4681924/4681946/4681946-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chan-Hee Choi (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the School of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Kyongsan, Korea, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Power Conversion Laboratory.","His current research interests include high-performance electrical machine drives and sensorless drives of ac machines."]},"firstName":"Chan-Hee","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292668400"},{"name":"Jul-Ki Seok","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Kyongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4681924/4681946/4681946-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jul-Ki Seok (S'94\u2013M'98) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1992, 1994, and 1998, respectively.","From 1998 to 2001, he was a Senior Engineer with the Production Engineering Center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea.

When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in an estimated synchronous frame, the envelope of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an amplitude-modulated pattern. Using this information, the IAS technique allows one to avoid multiple zero crossings of HF currents by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. At no-load condition, the pulsating voltage is injected only on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n-axis, while the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value.

Thus, the proposed sensorless control enforces a much better estimation performance in a region of ZCC without a predefined offline commissioning test than the standard pulsating injection scheme.

The torque-speed characteristics of a real scroll compressor have been measured and then emulated by a brushless internal mounted permanent magnets machine controlled in torque. This emulated scroll compressor has been driven by a field-oriented controlled induction motor drive. The whole car model as well as the PEMFC have been implemented by software on the same DSP which implements the drive control algorithm; in this way, the hardware-in-the-loop structure has been employed for emulating the behavior of a real car including the electrical supply of the PEMFC. The whole system has been tested with a classic European Driving Cycle. Two experimental rigs have been setup, one for characterizing the scroll compressor and the other for emulating the entire vehicle. The experimental results have shown that the speed reference profile, obtained during a urban driving cycle, is followed correctly, and that the tank-to-wheel efficiency remains at quite high values confirming the goodness of the proposed technological solution. The hardware-in-the-loop approach of the experimental rig allows tests to be performed to verify the operation in steady and transient states with low cost and reduced employment of the fuel cell stack, with resulting increased durability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","volume":"44","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10313270","publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681957/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Scroll Compressor With a High-Performance Induction Motor Drive for the Air Management of a PEMFC System for Automotive Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scroll Compressor With a High-Performance Induction Motor Drive for the Air Management of a PEMFC System for Automotive Applications","sourcePdf":"tia-pucci-2006304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098241S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4681924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4681924","articleId":"4681957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4681960,"authors":[{"name":"Poh Chiang Loh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4681924/4681960/4681960-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Poh Chiang Loh (S'01\u2013M'04) received the B.Eng.

In principle, an indirect matrix converter is constructed by connecting a front-end bidirectional rectification stage to a conventional two-level inversion stage with no bulky capacitive or inductive energy storage connected to their intermediate dc link. Through the proper modulation and compensation of the resulting converter, sinusoidal input current and output voltage can be achieved with minimized rectification switching loss, rendering the indirect matrix converter as a competitive choice for interfacing the utility grid to, e.g., defense facilities that require a different frequency supply. As an improvement, an indirect matrix converter assembled using a three-level energy processing stage has briefly been mentioned in the literature, but has neither been tested in simulation nor experimentally because its operational principles, pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) control, and index compensation have not yet been discussed in the existing literature. Addressing the previously described issues, this paper focuses on the operational mode analysis of a three-level indirect matrix converter implemented using a neutral-point-clamped inversion stage and the design of a number of PWM and modulation ratio compensation schemes for controlling the converter with improved waveform quality. The performances and practicalities of the designed schemes are verified in simulation and experimentally using an implemented laboratory prototype with some representative results captured and presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.2006321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.2006321","startPage":"1805","endPage":"1814","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4681924/04681960.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsewidth Modulation of Neutral-Point-Clamped Indirect Matrix Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Pulsewidth Modulation of Neutral-Point-Clamped Indirect Matrix Converter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4681960/","accessionNumber":"10313272","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4681960/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsewidth Modulation of Neutral-Point-Clamped Indirect Matrix Converter","sourcePdf":"tia-loh-2006321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087628S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4681924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4681924","articleId":"4681960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4681965,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Suk Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4681924/4681965/4681965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tae-Suk Kwon (S'04\u2013M'08) was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1973.

We perform preliminary experiments on standard benchmark course timetable problems and able to produce promising results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.379","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4681984/04682035.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"260","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating University Course Timetable Using Genetic Algorithms and Local Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Generating University Course Timetable Using Genetic Algorithms and Local Search","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10395043","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4682035/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating University Course Timetable Using Genetic Algorithms and Local Search","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3407a254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081063S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4681983","isNumber":"4681984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4681983","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4681984","articleId":"4682035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4682039,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Kyung Ryu","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, Pukyong National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Kyung","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37534588000"},{"name":"Kwang-Seok Moon","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, Pukyong National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang-Seok","lastName":"Moon","id":"37288246400"},{"name":"Jong-Nam Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, Pukyong National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Nam","lastName":"Kim","id":"37423841900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3407-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682039","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Motion estimation","Computational efficiency","Degradation","Telecommunication computing","Information technology","Moon","MPEG 4 Standard","Calibration","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial distortion elimination algorithm","uniform subblock matching scan","real-time video coding","full search motion estimation","normalized dithering order matching scan","threshold error calibration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion Estimation","Partial Distortion Elimination","sub-block matching"]}],"abstract":"Full search motion estimation in real-time video coding requires large amount of computations.

The contrast is enhanced in the low frequency components based on non-linear transform in the contourlet domain. GA is used to obtain the optimal non-linear gray level transform parameters. Noise is reduced in the high frequency components in the contourlet domain. Then the processed typhoon cloud image is used to segment the main body of the typhoon from the typhoon cloud image. First, the gray-level histogram of original image is obtained. In order to reduce noise, the gray-level histogram is smoothed by Bezier curve and Bezier histogram is obtained. A proper threshold is determined in the Bezier histogram to segment the typhoon cloud image.

Sensor nodes are highly resource constrained in terms of limited processing speed, runtime memory, persistent storage, communication bandwidth, and finite energy. An efficient and reliable file system is highly required, with consideration of sensor node constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel log structured NAND flash memory based file system, called Proceeding to Intelligent service-oriented memorY Allocation (PIYA), for data centric flash based sensor node devices. Main goals of PIYA scheme are allocation of memory to the sensor data by their business oriented rules, and to achieve the reduced SRAM space by keeping very low size of mapping information. The scheme intelligently samples and stores the raw data, and keeps the aggregate data for long time, than no other scheme has done before.

Since the channel between first hop (source station-relay station) and second hop (relay station -destination station) varies independently, the subcarrier in the first hop can be paired to another subcarrier in the second hop for the increase of the system capacity. The conventional pairing which uses the brute force searching requires large complexity while giving optimal pairing for maximum system capacity. In this paper, we present sub-optimal subcarrier pairing scheme with low complexity. Every RS firstly pairs the subcarrier with the highest channel gain in the first hop to the subcarrier with highest channel gain in the second hop. The pair with the highest SNR among all the pairs is determined as final selected pair and the corresponding subcarriers are not selected at other RSs in the next paring iteration. This process is repeated until all the subcarriers are paired. Simulation results show the proposed pairing scheme achieves near optimal performance with low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.18","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4681984/04682104.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681984","startPage":"675","endPage":"678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Subcarrier Pairing Scheme for OFDM Based Multiple AF Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Subcarrier Pairing Scheme for OFDM Based Multiple AF Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682104/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10395112","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4682104/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Subcarrier Pairing Scheme for OFDM Based Multiple AF Relay Systems","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3407a675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042253S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4681983","isNumber":"4681984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4681983","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4681984","articleId":"4682104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4682114,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenzhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37880415200"},{"name":"Weixia Zou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weixia","lastName":"Zou","id":"37302064900"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Honggang Zhang","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280788800"},{"name":"Yabin Ye","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Italy"],"firstName":"Yabin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37279356900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3407-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682114","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Sensor fusion","Chromium","Detectors","Testing","Statistical analysis","Wireless communication","Fading","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision fusion","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","censoring detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio (CR)","Spectrum Sensing","Decision Fusion","Censoring Detection","Energy Detector"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision Fusion of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio under Bandwidth Constraints","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681984","endPage":"736","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4681984/04682114.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.15","startPage":"733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682114","abstract":"Cooperative spectrum sensing among cognitive radio nodes is needed in order to overcome fading and shadowing effects on individual cognitive user and to increase the reliability and efficiency of spectrum sensing.

However only conventional fusion rules are considered and the \"No decision\" information by censoring sensor nodes is disregarded by recent research work. Actually the \"No decision\" message can be known by fusion center during their signaling process.

fusion rules on the improvement of the detection performance of spectrum sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast

systems. Each single subband is resolved into a series of contiguous frequency bins via the FFT engine. The identification of PU signals can thus be performed in frequency domain with our proposed methods, namely the localization algorithm based on double thresholding with prior one-dimensional median filtering (MF+LAD) and the FCME algorithm with binary integration (FCME+BI). In both strategies, two thresholds are employed in the detection decision making stage to perform the frequency bin cluster based PU signal identification. It is verified through numerical experiments that the two strategies can significantly improve wideband PU signals' bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation accuracies.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.297","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4681984/04682135.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Primary User Signal Identification Approaches for Cognitive MB-OFDM UWB Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682135/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Primary User Signal Identification Approaches for Cognitive MB-OFDM UWB Systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10395143","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682135/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Primary User Signal Identification Approaches for Cognitive MB-OFDM UWB Systems","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3407a848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115743S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4681983","isNumber":"4681984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4681983","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4681984","articleId":"4682135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4682139,"authors":[{"name":"Wondae Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Control Engineering, Handong University, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wondae","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37884958400"},{"name":"Byungkil Han","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byungkil","lastName":"Han","id":"37675451000"},{"name":"Jaehyo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Control Engineering, Handong University, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehyo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37600786800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3407-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682139","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682139","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Position control","Electromyography","Manipulators","Robots","Control systems","Wrist","Muscles","Degradation","Signal design","Low pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","low-pass filters","manipulators","medical control systems","medical signal processing","neural nets","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous position control","EMG","robot manipulations","electromyography","wrist movements","muscle tension","low-pass filtering","supervised multilayer neural network","backpropagation algorithm","teleoperated robotic manipulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EMG signals","continuous position control","muscle","human interface"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.326","startPage":"870","endPage":"874","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4681984/04682139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Position Control of 1 DOF Manipulator Using EMG Signals","abstract":"One of the main problems of robot manipulations by using bio-signal interface is discontinuous position control. This discontinuity causes undesirable effects on users such as lack of accuracy and an overall degraded performance. This paper presents the control strategy for the continuous position control of 1 DOF manipulator using electromyography (EMG) signals. We designed the control system which makes possible that 1 DOF manipulator replicate the wrist movements by estimating the wrist joint angle continuously from EMG signals measured from the four muscles. In order to estimate the joint angle, we transformed raw EMG signals to quasi-tensions, which represent the actual muscle tension, using low-pass filtering. A supervised multi-layer neural network trained by a back-propagation algorithm which estimates a joint angle from quasi-tensions, so that the proposed system controls the manipulator continuously with the obtained time-varying angle. The proposed methodology can be applied to improve the control strategy for tele-operated robotic manipulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4682139/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10395147","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Position Control of 1 DOF Manipulator Using EMG Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Position Control of 1 DOF Manipulator Using EMG Signals","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3407a870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045327S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4681983","isNumber":"4681984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4681983","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4681984","articleId":"4682139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682145,"authors":[{"name":"Mingrui Zou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mingrui","lastName":"Zou","id":"37657860500"},{"name":"Chengshi Zhao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chengshi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37396943400"},{"name":"Bin Shen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Shen","id":"37394691600"},{"name":"Kyungsup Kwak","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungsup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3407-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682145","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Cognitive radio","Information technology","Monitoring","FCC","Relays","Access protocols","Electronic mail","Signal detection","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode-and-forward protocol","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","decodability","amplify-and-forward protocol","outage probability","detection probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682145","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.168","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, secondary users are allowed to access the under-utilized spectrum and opportunistically transmit whenever no primary signals are detected. So these unlicensed users need to monitor spectrum accurately to detect the presence of the licensed users. In this paper, we exploit a cooperative spectrum sensing between two secondary users to improve the detection performance when one of the users is standing in the decodability boundary of the primary user, which is difficult to detect the presence of this licensed user. We develop this cooperative spectrum sensing with decode-and-forward (DF) diversity protocol, and make a comparison with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol in terms of detection probability and outage probability. We illustrate that DF protocol has better performance than AF in detection probability, contrarily, AF is better than DF in outage probability. Then, under DF diversity protocol, we extend the number of cooperative secondary users, which is illustrated that as the number is increased, we can get a better detection performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681984","startPage":"902","endPage":"907","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4681984/04682145.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decode-and-Forward Protocol Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4682145/","displayDocTitle":"Decode-and-Forward Protocol Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10395153","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decode-and-Forward Protocol Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3407a902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050389S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4681983","isNumber":"4681984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4681983","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4681984","articleId":"4682145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4682175,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Leboeuf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Leboeuf","id":"37399330600"},{"name":"Ashkan Hosseinzadeh Namin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ashkan Hosseinzadeh","lastName":"Namin","id":"37294693900"},{"name":"Roberto Muscedere","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Muscedere","id":"37294787800"},{"name":"Huapeng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Huapeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292237900"},{"name":"Majid Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37276374600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3407-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682175","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1023},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682175","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Table lookup","Hardware","Artificial neural networks","Decoding","Piecewise linear approximation","Information technology","Image classification","Motor drives","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperbolic equations","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed VLSI implementation","hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function","artificial neural networks","decoding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neuron","VLSI","Sigmoid Function"]}],"abstract":"The hyperbolic tangent function is commonly used as the activation function in artificial neural networks.

Anomaly-based approaches in intrusion detection systems have the advantage of being able to detect unknown attacks; they look for patterns that deviate from the normal behavior. We have proposed an approach of anomaly intrusion detection system by using Gaussian mixture model. This method learns patterns of normal and intrusive activities to classify that use a set of Gaussian probability distribution functions. The use of maximum likelihood in detection phase has used the deviation between current and reference behavior. GMM is evaluated by dataset KDD99 without any special hardware requirements. Experimental results show that this method is able to reducing the missing alarm.

The partial block MC-CDMA is a technique to improve performance. It functions by obtaining frequency diversity gain while avoiding ICI (inter code interference) through despreading of code in the receiver, after transmitting the same data in a different sub-carrier using the code spreading of the partial block. However, the frequency diversity gain can not be maximized because of the high correlation caused by using adjacent sub-carriers. Therefore, we propose a distribution diversity system using a low correlation carriers system to achieve the improved frequency diversity.

However, this advantage is in terms of average sum rate performance, which is less meaningful when the quality of service is considered in system design. In this paper, we study the outage probability performance of random beamforming for both single receive antenna and multiple receive antenna with ZF receiver cases to consider the quality of service issues such as required data rate and outage probability itself. For single receive antenna case, the outage probability is lower bounded along with SNR due to its interference-limited nature. When multiple receive antennas are deployed at each user, the outage probability achieves the diversity of the number of users, but it has power penalty as much as the multiplexing gain. We also show exploiting multiple antennas at each user achieves larger multiplexing gain for given required data rate and outage probability. However, in low SNR regime, using single receive antenna reduces receiver complexity while achieving little performance degradation compared to multiple receive antenna case.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.228","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4682195/04682260.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.228","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","startPage":"317","endPage":"323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Random Beamforming for MIMO Broadcast Channel: Outage Probability Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Random Beamforming for MIMO Broadcast Channel: Outage Probability Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682260/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4682260/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10395257","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Random Beamforming for MIMO Broadcast Channel: Outage Probability Approach","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3407c317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085532S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4681983","isNumber":"4682195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4681983","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4682195","articleId":"4682260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4682263,"authors":[{"name":"Dae Wook Byun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae Wook","lastName":"Byun","id":"38257462500"},{"name":"Young Min Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Min","lastName":"Cho","id":"37403266100"},{"name":"Dong Ku Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Ku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3407-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682263","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Power control","Downlink","Power system relaying","Throughput","Frame relay","Performance evaluation","Power system modeling","MIMO","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","IEEE standards","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","relay power control","TDD-OFDMA downlink","time division duplex","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency division multiple access","IEEE 802.16j system","resource management problem","overlapped subchannel allocation","orthogonal subchannel allocation","on-off mobile relay control","proportional fair scheduling","mobility assisted opportunistic scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Relay","Resource Allocation","Power Control","OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the system performances of the IEEE 802.16j system with mobile relays such as cell throughput and service coverage.

This OCST problem can be applied in the many network optimization problems, such as network topology design problems, multicast tree configuration problems, and ad-hoc network or ubiquitous sensor network routing problems, and so forth. Recently, the more concern about the reliable network systems have been increasing, in order to provide the various services and contents requested from the users in communication network systems. This paper presents a genetic algorithm with the proposed encoding method based on Prufer number (PN) and a clustering string, to solve the reliable OCST problems.

The traditional approach with random initial population is efficient however the whole initial population may contain infeasible solutions, which causes GA take longer to converge. The GA was modified in various ways to achieve faster and better convergence and it was particularly recognized by the researchers that initial population greatly affects the performance of GA. This study proposes modified GA with sorted initial population and applies it to solving travelling salesman problem (TSP). Normally the bigger the initial the population the more computationally expensive the calculation becomes with each generation. New approach will allow reducing the size of the initial problem while preserving a better fit population and thus leading to faster and better convergence. GA is based on theory of natural selection and new approach sorts out initial population so that only those with higher fitness are retained. It gives grounds to assume that a better solution can be obtained and in a shorter time. Moreover, new approach proposes that genetic algorithm has less probability of being stuck in the local optimum and rather produces a result close to global optimum. The proposed approach is tested on a simulator built using object-oriented approach and the test results prove the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2008.373","pdfPath":"/iel5/4681983/4682195/04682381.pdf","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1028","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem with Sorted Population","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem with Sorted Population","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10395378","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4682381/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem with Sorted Population","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3407d024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043375S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4681983","isNumber":"4682195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4681983","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4682195","articleId":"4682381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4682455,"authors":[{"name":"Donato Hern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda Mccanica, Electrica y Electr\u00f3nica Universidad de Guanajuato, Gto., M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Donato","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez","id":"37286225100"},{"name":"Sergio Ledesma","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda Mccanica, Electrica y Electr\u00f3nica Universidad de Guanajuato, Gto., M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Ledesma","id":"37300379900"},{"name":"Rene Mart\u00ednez","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda Mccanica, Electrica y Electr\u00f3nica Universidad de Guanajuato, Gto., M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Mart\u00ednez","id":"37089097968"},{"name":"Gabriel Avi\u00f1a","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda Mccanica, Electrica y Electr\u00f3nica Universidad de Guanajuato, Gto., M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Avi\u00f1a","id":"37563756900"},{"name":"Gerardo Canedo","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda Mccanica, Electrica y Electr\u00f3nica Universidad de Guanajuato, Gto., M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Canedo","id":"37300381200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3441-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682455","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Noise cancellation","Noise reduction","Frequency","Artificial neural networks","Fast Fourier transforms","Digital filters","Artificial intelligence","Phase noise","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal noise reduction","complex autoassociative neural networks","sawtooth signals","fast Fourier transform","FFT","inverse transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex Neural Networks","Noise Cancelling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Complex Neural Networks on Noise Cancelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682455","doi":"10.1109/MICAI.2008.67","startPage":"138","endPage":"142","publicationTitle":"2008 Seventh Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Seventh Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/4682423/4682424/04682455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICAI.2008.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682424","abstract":"We present a method to reduce noise on signals applying complex auto-associative neural networks.

Typically, these signals have a parametric representation with a finite number of degrees of freedom per time unit. It was shown that, by choosing suitable sampling kernels, the parameters can be computed by employing high-resolution spectral estimation techniques. In this letter, we propose a simple acquisition and reconstruction method within the framework of multichannel sampling. In the proposed approach, an infinite stream of nonuniformly-spaced Dirac impulses can be sampled and accurately reconstructed provided that there is at most one Dirac impulse per sampling period. The reconstruction algorithm has a low computational complexity, and the parameters are computed on the fly. The processing delay is minimal just the sampling period. We propose sampling circuits using inexpensive passive devices such as resistors and capacitors. We also show how the approach can be extended to sample piecewise-constant signals with a minimal change in the system configuration. We provide some simulation results to confirm the theoretical findings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Sampling Method for Finite-Rate-of-Innovation-Signal Reconstruction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2008.2006316","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04682542.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2008.2006316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Sampling Method for Finite-Rate-of-Innovation-Signal Reconstruction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/4682542/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10346034","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Sampling Method for Finite-Rate-of-Innovation-Signal Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-cseelamantula-2006316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038122S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4682542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682548,"authors":[{"name":"Esa Ollila","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki, Finland","Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Esa","lastName":"Ollila","id":"37268424200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4682548","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1397},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random variables","Testing","Signal processing","Covariance matrix","Transceivers","Additive noise","Array signal processing","Binary phase shift keying","Interference","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","covariance matrices","geometry","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex random variable","circularity property","second-order moment","circularity quotient","intuitive geometrical interpretation","principal square-root","covariance matrix","eccentricity approach","generalized likelihood ratio test","asymptotic chi2 2 distribution","correlation coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circularity coefficient","complex random variable","correlation coefficient","eccentricity","EVD","noncircular random variable"]}],"abstract":"An important characteristic of a complex random variable z is the so-called circularity property or lack of it. We study the properties of the degree of circularity based on second-order moments, called circularity quotient, that is shown to possess an intuitive geometrical interpretation: the modulus and phase of its principal square-root are equal to the eccentricity and angle of orientation of the ellipse defined by the covariance matrix of the real and imaginary part of z. Hence, when the eccentricity approaches the minimum zero (ellipse is a circle), the circularity quotient vanishes; when the eccentricity approaches the maximum one, the circularity quotient lies on the unit complex circle. Connection with the correlation coefficient rho is established and bounds on rho given the circularity quotient (and vice versa) are derived. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) of circularity assuming complex normal sample is shown to be a function of the modulus of the circularity quotient with asymptotic chi\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n distribution.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2008.2005050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04682548.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2008.2005050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Circularity of a Complex Random Variable","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682548/","displayDocTitle":"On the Circularity of a Complex Random Variable","volume":"15","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10346040","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682548/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Circularity of a Complex Random Variable","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-eollila-2005050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048923S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4682548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4682552,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Jy Shyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jong-Jy","lastName":"Shyu","id":"37312363500"},{"name":"Soo-Chang Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Soo-Chang","lastName":"Pei","id":"37271112500"},{"name":"Cheng-Han Chan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Han","lastName":"Chan","id":"37311093200"},{"name":"Yun-Da Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yun-Da","lastName":"Huang","id":"37309659300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4682552","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, an iterative weighted least-squares (LS) approach is proposed for the design of variable fractional-delay (VFD) finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters in minimax sense.

Comparing with the existing method, the proposed method does not lead to a misleading problem, and the performance of convergence is also better.

Relying on the flexibility of this approach two different architectures are proposed: a parametric one able to achieve high decoding throughputs (> 165 Mb/s) while keeping low overall decoder complexity (45 KGates), a flexible implementation able to dynamically adapt to the modulation scheme (4-,16-,64-QAM) retaining the low complexity and high throughput features.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4717837/04682588.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding the Golden Code: A VLSI Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO","Throughput","Hardware","Block codes","Wireless communication","Telecommunication network reliability","Wireless LAN","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive decoding","adaptive modulation","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI decoder design","multiple-input-multiple-output systems","MIMO system","sphere decoding algorithm","maximum-likelihood decoding performance","QAM modulation size","adaptive modulation schemes","high decoding throughputs","optimal space-time block code","decoder complexity","flexible implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital architectures","Golden code","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","sphere decoding","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Decoding the Golden Code: A VLSI Design","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4682588/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10369912","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding the Golden Code: A VLSI Design","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi11-gmasera-2003163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073487S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4717837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4717837","articleId":"4682588","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682589,"authors":[{"name":"Dani\u00cbl Schinkel","affiliation":["Axiom-IC B.V., Enschede, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4717837/4682589/4682589-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dani\u00ebl Schinkel (S'03\u2013M'08) was born in Finsterwolde, the Netherlands, in 1978.

In this work, a test vector signal set with three phase differences and one amplitude difference is employed to detect the amplitude and phase mismatches at the same time. The proposed method can predict the exact mismatch value without any iterations, because the mismatch value has a unique solution with a closed-form expression with the proposed test signal set. Moreover, the sensitivity of the proposed method to the measurement noise is also analyzed for practical implementation of LINC system. The LINC system is realized with the proposed mismatch detection method and the performance is evaluated with a IEEE 802.16 WiMAX signal, which has 7 MHz channel bandwidth and 16-QAM. The error vector magnitude (EVM) of -37.4 dB is obtained through performance testing, which meets the performance requirement of -24 dB EVM. The proposed mismatch detection method is validated to improve the LINC system performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Closed-form solution","Testing","Signal processing","Vectors","Phase detection","WiMAX","OFDM modulation","Peak to average power ratio","Degradation","High power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatch detection","compensation method","LINC system","closed-form expression","linear amplification with nonlinear components","error vector magnitude","WiMax","IEEE 802.16 WiMAX","bandwidth 7 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Closed-form expression","compensation","linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC) system","mismatch detection","WiMAX"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2006805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4696623/04682590.pdf","startPage":"3050","endPage":"3057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4696623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2006805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mismatch Detection and Compensation Method for the LINC System Using a Closed-Form Expression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mismatch Detection and Compensation Method for the LINC System Using a Closed-Form Expression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682590/","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682590/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10349067","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mismatch Detection and Compensation Method for the LINC System Using a Closed-Form Expression","sourcePdf":"56tmtt12-smyoung-2006805-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156675S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4696623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4696623","articleId":"4682590","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4682592,"authors":[{"name":"Masatake Hangai","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatake","lastName":"Hangai","id":"37296457600"},{"name":"Hideki Asao","affiliation":["Communication Systems Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Asao","id":"37266938300"},{"name":"Morishige Hieda","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Morishige","lastName":"Hieda","id":"37298284600"},{"name":"Mamiko Yamaguchi","affiliation":["High Frequency and Optical Device Works, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamiko","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37576737800"},{"name":"Moriyasu Miyazaki","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Moriyasu","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"37280521400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"4682592","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Attenuators","FETs","Optical resonators","Impedance","Frequency","Dynamic range","Attenuation","Equivalent circuits","Insertion loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attenuators","field effect MMIC","field effect transistors","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude-phase temperature compensation attenuators","variable-Q field-effect transistor resonators","variable-Q FET resonators","monolithic microwave integrated circuit technology","insertion loss","loss 4.5 dB","loss 4.9 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attenuator","field-effect transistor (FET)","monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)","Schottky diodes","temperature compensation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682592","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> Amplitude/phase temperature compensation attenuators have been developed.

In this paper, discrete-dopant-induced characteristic fluctuation of 16-nm-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) circuit under high-frequency regime is quantitatively studied. The circuit gain, the 3 dB bandwidth and the unity-gain bandwidth of the tested nanoscale transistor circuit are calculated concurrently capturing the discrete-dopant-number- and discrete- dopant-position-induced fluctuations in the large-scale statistically sound ldquoatomisticrdquo device/circuit coupled simulation. For the 16-nm-gate MOSFET circuit, the number of discrete dopants, varying from zero to 14, may result in 5.7% variation of the circuit gain, 14.1% variation of the 3 dB bandwidth, and 10.4% variation of the unity-gain bandwidth. To suppress the high-frequency characteristic fluctuations, an improved doping distribution along the longitudinal diffusion direction from the MOSFET's surface to substrate is further performed to examine the associated fluctuation. The improved vertical doping profile with less dopants locating near surface of channel effectively reduces the fluctuations of the circuit gain, the 3 dB bandwidth and the unity-gain bandwidth dramatically. Compared with the original doping profile, the reduction is 32.3%, 19.4% and 51.8%, respectively. This study provides an insight into random-dopant-induced intrinsic high-frequency characteristic fluctuations and verifies the potential fluctuation suppression technique on high-frequency characteristic fluctuations of nanoscale transistor circuit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Frequency Characteristic Fluctuations of Nano-MOSFET Circuit Induced by Random Dopants","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007077","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4696624/04682602.pdf","startPage":"2726","endPage":"2733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4696624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"High-Frequency Characteristic Fluctuations of Nano-MOSFET Circuit Induced by Random Dopants","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4682602/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10349105","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Frequency Characteristic Fluctuations of Nano-MOSFET Circuit Induced by Random Dopants","sourcePdf":"56tmtt12-yli-2007077-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108323S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4696624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4696624","articleId":"4682602","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682603,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Monzo-Cabrera","affiliation":["Departamento de Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y las Comunicaciones, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena Murcia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4696624/4682603/4682603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juan Monz\u00f3-Cabrera was born in Elda (Alicante), Spain, on January 1973.

An automated procedure consisting of a moving sample within a multimode cavity has enabled different reflection coefficients to be obtained.

This technique can be used in sleep apnea monitor, lie detector, and baby monitor to eliminate the false alarm caused by random body movement. It is shown that if the dc offset of the baseband signal is accurately calibrated, both demodulation techniques can be used for random body movement cancellation. While the complex signal demodulation is less likely to be affected by a dc offset, the arctangent demodulation has the advantage of eliminating harmonic and intermodulation interference at high carrier frequencies. When the dc offset cannot be accurately calibrated, the complex signal demodulation is more favorable. Ray-tracing model is used to show the effects of constellation deformation and optimum/null detection ambiguity caused by the phase offset due to finite antenna directivity. Experiments have been performed using 4-7 GHz radar to verify the theory.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4696623/04682605.pdf","startPage":"3143","endPage":"3152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4696623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Body Movement Cancellation in Doppler Radar Vital Sign Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Random Body Movement Cancellation in Doppler Radar Vital Sign Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682605/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10349074","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682605/","volume":"56","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Body Movement Cancellation in Doppler Radar Vital Sign Detection","sourcePdf":"tmtt-li-2007139-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064395S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4696623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"4696623","articleId":"4682605","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4682606,"authors":[{"name":"Ken B.

The proposed platform enables exploiting all parallelism levels of turbo decoding applications to fulfill performance requirements. In order to fulfill flexibility requirements, the platform is structured around configurable application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIP) combined with an efficient memory and communication interconnect scheme. The designed ASIP has an single instruction multiple data (SIMD) architecture with a specialized and extensible instruction-set and 6-stages pipeline control. The attached memories and communication interfaces enable its integration in multiprocessor architectures. These multiprocessor architectures benefit from the recent shuffled decoding technique introduced in the turbo-decoding field to achieve higher throughput. The major characteristics of the proposed platform are its flexibility and scalability which make it reusable for all simple and double binary turbo codes of existing and emerging standards. Results obtained for double binary WiMAX turbo codes demonstrate around 250 Mb/s throughput using 16-ASIP multiprocessor architecture.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4717837/04682609.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717837","startPage":"92","endPage":"102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Parallelism Levels to a Multi-ASIP Architecture for Turbo Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"From Parallelism Levels to a Multi-ASIP Architecture for Turbo Decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10369913","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4682609/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Parallelism Levels to a Multi-ASIP Architecture for Turbo Decoding","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi11-omuller-2003164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080033S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4717837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4717837","articleId":"4682609","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682611,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Gorod","affiliation":["School of Systems and Enterprises, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/4711367/4682611/4682611-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Gorod (M'07) received the B.S. degree in information systems and the M.S. degree in telecommunications from Pace University, NY.","Prior to his graduate studies, he held a Research Analyst position with Salomon Smith Barney.

In systems engineering, we develop architectures and frameworks to bring meaning to this kind of uncertainty, but for SoS engineering (SoSE) we are still in search of how we can structure this understanding. In this paper, we review the SoS literature to illustrate the need to create an SoSE management framework based on the demands of constant technological progress in a complex dynamic environment. We conclude from this review that the history and evolution of defining SoS has shown that: (1) SoS can be defined by distinguishing characteristics and (2) SoS can be viewed as a network where the ldquobest practicesrdquo of network management can be applied to SoSE. We use these two theories as a foundation for our objective to create an effective SoSE management framework. To accomplish this, we utilize modified fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) network principles (SoSE management conceptual areas). Furthermore, cited distinguishing characteristics of SoS are also used to present a SoSE management framework. We conclude with a case analysis of this framework using a known and well-documented SoS (i.e., Integrated Deepwater System) to illustrate how to better understand, engineer, and manage within the domain of SoSE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","volume":"2","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10370940","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4682611/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"System-of-Systems Engineering Management: A Review of Modern History and a Path Forward","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-of-Systems Engineering Management: A Review of Modern History and a Path Forward","sourcePdf":"jsyst-sauser-2007163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107002S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"4711367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4711367","articleId":"4682611","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4682621,"authors":[{"name":"Wu-Hua Chen","firstName":"Wu-Hua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279192800"},{"name":"Wei Xing Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, Penrith South, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei Xing","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37288601200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4682621","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682621","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> This brief is concerned with asymptotic stability of neural networks with uncertain delays.

Background subtraction is a very popular approach for foreground segmentation in a still scene image. In order to compensate for illumination changes, a background model updating process is generally adopted, and leads to extra computation time. In this paper, we propose a fast background subtraction scheme using independent component analysis (ICA) and, particularly, aims at indoor surveillance for possible applications in home-care and health-care monitoring, where moving and motionless persons must be reliably detected. The proposed method is as computationally fast as the simple image difference method, and yet is highly tolerable to changes in room lighting. The proposed background subtraction scheme involves two stages, one for training and the other for detection. In the training stage, an ICA model that directly measures the statistical independency based on the estimations of joint and marginal probability density functions from relative frequency distributions is first proposed. The proposed ICA model can well separate two highly-correlated images. In the detection stage, the trained de-mixing vector is used to separate the foreground in a scene image with respect to the reference background image. Two sets of indoor examples that involve switching on/off room lights and opening/closing a door are demonstrated in the experiments. The performance of the proposed ICA model for background subtraction is also compared with that of the well-known FastICA algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4711346/04682624.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2007558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2007558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent Component Analysis-Based Background Subtraction for Indoor Surveillance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Independent component analysis","Layout","Frequency estimation","Video surveillance","Object detection","Image sequences","Target tracking","Image recognition","Target recognition","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image sequences","independent component analysis","object detection","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["independent component analysis","background subtraction","indoor surveillance","video surveillance","moving objects detection","image sequence","target tracking","activity recognition","behavior understanding","foreground segmentation","ICA","health-care monitoring","home-care monitoring","image difference method","room lighting","statistical independency","probability density functions","frequency distributions","demixing vector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Background subtraction","foreground segmentation","independent component analysis (ICA)","indoor surveillance"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Principal Component Analysis","Reproducibility of Results","Security Measures","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Independent Component Analysis-Based Background Subtraction for Indoor Surveillance","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4682624/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10361728","pubMedId":"19095527","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent Component Analysis-Based Background Subtraction for Indoor Surveillance","sourcePdf":"18tip01-dtsai-2007558.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071512S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4711346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"4711346","articleId":"4682624","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682625,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios S.

The most usual way to apply them also in color image sequences is to process each color channel separately. A different, more sophisticated approach is to process the color channels in a ldquoholisticrdquo manner using quaternions, as proposed by Ell and Sangwine. In this paper, we extend standard spatiotemporal Fourier-based approaches to handle color image sequences, using the hypercomplex Fourier transform. We show that translational motions are manifested as energy concentration along planes in the hypercomplex 3D Fourier domain and we describe a methodology to estimate the motions, based on this property. Furthermore, we compare the three-channels-separately approach with our approach and we show that the computational effort can be reduced by a factor of 1/3, using the hypercomplex Fourier transform. Also, we propose a simple, accompanying method to extract the moving objects in the hypercomplex Fourier domain. Our experimental results on synthetic and natural images verify our arguments throughout the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Motions in Color Image Sequences Using Hypercomplex Fourier Transforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2007603","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4711346/04682625.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2007603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Motions in Color Image Sequences Using Hypercomplex Fourier Transforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4682625/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10361731","pubMedId":"19095528","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Motions in Color Image Sequences Using Hypercomplex Fourier Transforms","sourcePdf":"18tip01-gsergiadis-2007603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140334S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4711346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4711346","articleId":"4682625","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682626,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad K.

The scalable extension of H.264/AVC that provides a combined temporal, quality and spatial scalability is used. For given channel conditions, we develop a method for the estimation of the distortion of the received video and propose different error concealment schemes. We show the accuracy of our distortion estimation algorithm in comparison with simulated wireless video transmission with packet errors. In the proposed MIMO system, we employ orthogonal space-time block codes (O-STBC) that guarantee independent transmission of different symbols within the block code. In the proposed constrained bandwidth allocation framework, we use the estimated end-to-end decoder distortion to optimally select the application layer parameters, i.e., quantization parameter (QP) and group of pictures (GOP) size, and physical layer parameters, i.e., rate-compatible turbo (RCPT) code rate and symbol constellation. Results show the substantial performance gain by using different symbol constellations across the scalable layers as compared to a fixed constellation.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2006600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4711346/04682626.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2006600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Distortion Estimation and Optimal Bandwidth Allocation for Scalable H.264 Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682626/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Distortion Estimation and Optimal Bandwidth Allocation for Scalable H.264 Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10361729","pubMedId":"19095522","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682626/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Distortion Estimation and Optimal Bandwidth Allocation for Scalable H.264 Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"17tip12-lkondi-2006600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099017S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4711346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4711346","articleId":"4682626","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682628,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The distributive portion of the device is modeled by the time-domain FEM to generate an electromagnetic subsystem, while the embedded lumped circuits are analyzed by a SPICE-like transient circuit solver to generate a circuit subsystem. A symmetric global system for both the electromagnetic and circuit unknowns is then established by combining the two fully discretized subsystems through coupling matrices to model their interactions. For active devices, the resulting global electromagnetic-circuit system usually includes nonlinear equations, and thus is solved by a solution algorithm carefully designed to handle nonlinearity. The proposed simulator significantly extends the capability of the existing time-domain finite element solver to model more complex and active devices such as microwave amplifiers. Numerical examples are presented to validate the algorithm and demonstrate its accuracy and applications.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4696624/04682636.pdf","startPage":"2875","endPage":"2884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4696624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Symmetric Electromagnetic-Circuit Simulator Based on the Extended Time-Domain Finite Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682636/","displayDocTitle":"A Symmetric Electromagnetic-Circuit Simulator Based on the Extended Time-Domain Finite Element Method","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10349089","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682636/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Symmetric Electromagnetic-Circuit Simulator Based on the Extended Time-Domain Finite Element Method","sourcePdf":"56tmtt12-jjin-2007336-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106918S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4696624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4696624","articleId":"4682636","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4682639,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Ramezani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Maryam Ramezani (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Ferdousi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree from Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.

As the proportion of power produced by wind farms increases, it becomes more difficult to predict accurately the total amount of power injected by all generators into the power system. This added uncertainty must be taken into account when setting the requirement for SR. This paper proposes a technique to calculate the optimal amount of SR that the system operator should provide to be able to respond not only to generation outages but also to errors in the forecasts for load and wind power production. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed technique for setting the SR requirements is then compared with the traditional deterministic criterion (i.e., the capacity of the largest online infeed), an approach to cope with wind imbalances and an approach that combines the traditional criterion with the approach to cope with wind imbalances. The results show that, contrary to what is commonly believed, an increased wind power penetration does not necessarily require larger amounts of SR.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2004745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2004745","startPage":"114","endPage":"124","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4762160/04682642.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating the Spinning Reserve Requirements in Systems With Significant Wind Power Generation Penetration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the Spinning Reserve Requirements in Systems With Significant Wind Power Generation Penetration","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682642/","accessionNumber":"10428865","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682642/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the Spinning Reserve Requirements in Systems With Significant Wind Power Generation Penetration","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ortegavasquez-2004745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086522S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"473","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4682642","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":4682651,"authors":[{"name":"Ludovic Bacque","affiliation":["G\u00e9nie Electrique et Informatique Industrielle (GEII), Institut Universitaire de Technologie, Brive-la-Gaillarde, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4696624/4682651/4682651-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ludovic Bacqu\u00e9 was born in P\u00e9rigueux, France, on September 7, 1980.

The amplifier used is based on a push-pull topology with LDMOS transistors and works in the 50-500 MHz frequency bandwidth. It delivers a nominal 100 W output power with 60% power-added efficiency (PAE) when it is fed with continuous signals. When it is driven by a 16QAM modulated signal, 6 dB input power back-off is necessary to keep an error vector measurement below 5%. This usual back-off technique results in lower PAE (43% in our case). By implementing the proposed bias control system, both 55% PAE and 5% EVM have been reached for 75 W average output power.

Consequently, the control of diesel engines has become a difficult task involving five to ten control variables that interact with each other and that are highly nonlinear. Actually, the control schemes of the engines are all based on static lookup tables identified on test-benches; the values of the control variables are interpolated using these tables and then, they are corrected, online, by using the control techniques in order to obtain better engine's response under dynamic conditions. In this paper, we are interested in developing a mathematical optimization process that search for the optimal control schemes of the diesel engines under static and dynamic conditions. First, we suggest modeling a turbocharged diesel engine and its opacity using the mean value model which requires limited experiments; the model's simulations are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Then the created model is integrated in a dynamic optimization process based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. The optimization results show the reduction of the opacity while enhancing the engine's effective power. Finally, we proposed a practical control technique based on the neural networks in order to apply these control schemes online to the engine. The neural controller is integrated into the engine's simulations and is used to control the engine in real time on the European transient cycle (ETC). The results confirm the validity of the neural controller.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2008.2001049","startPage":"380","endPage":"393","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems

A parametric study, based on a full-wave numerical modal approach that analyzes a unit cell using a periodic layered-medium Green's function, is shown to be an efficient approach to accurately design the structure, completely eliminating open-stopband effects and achieving an almost constant radiation efficiency when the beam is scanned through broadside. Results obtained by the proposed approach are compared with those obtained by means of both an artificial transmission-line analysis and a Bloch-wave analysis, which use the full-wave simulation of a finite-length structure. The balanced condition is interpreted in terms of the behavior of the phase and attenuation constants relevant to the radiating harmonic. Furthermore, it is shown how radiation at broadside is guaranteed by the presence of two radiating elements (one series and one shunt) within the equivalent circuit of the unit cell. The effectiveness of the analysis is demonstrated through the design of a finite-length antenna excited by a source at one end.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10349102","htmlLink":"/document/4682674/","displayDocTitle":"Full-Wave Modal Dispersion Analysis and Broadside Optimization for a Class of Microstrip CRLH Leaky-Wave Antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Wave Modal Dispersion Analysis and Broadside Optimization for a Class of Microstrip CRLH Leaky-Wave Antennas","sourcePdf":"56tmtt12-spaulotto-2007333-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06098S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4696624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"4696624","articleId":"4682674","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4682680,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Bonello","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Bonello","id":"37392886700"},{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533619600"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4682680","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":129},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce and outline the concept of channel code-division multiple access using a design example based on the recently proposed multilevel-structured (MLS) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

The recent IEEE 802.11e standard provides quality-of-service (QoS) support, and the pending 802.11n standard further increases the transmission rate by using the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique. Multiple antennas can be used to improve the performance gain by either increasing the transmission reliability through spatial diversity or increasing the transmission rate through spatial multiplexing. This new characteristic at the wireless physical (PHY) layer requires the corresponding adaptation at the medium access control (MAC) layer to reach the best performance gain. In this paper, we propose cross-layer design schemes for WLANs under two different MAC protocols: the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)-based 802.11e MAC and the slotted Aloha MAC. For the 802.11e MAC, two different contention window (CW) size adaptation schemes, namely, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">U-MAC</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D-MAC</i>\n, are proposed, which facilitate the MAC protocol to jointly adapt its CW size with the PHY layer's MIMO operating parameters. For the slotted Aloha MAC, a cross-layer optimization framework \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NUM-O</i>\n is proposed to jointly optimize the MIMO configuration at the PHY layer and the persistent probabilities for different classes of multimedia traffic at the MAC layer.

The concentration of users in some areas, particularly those far away from the base stations, can result in quality-of-service degradation due to high propagation losses. In this context, repeaters have turned out to be cost-effective nodes that are capable of mitigating these negative effects. This paper describes and models a multicellular/multiservice wideband code division multiple access system with repeaters in an environment with spatial nonuniformities. An analytical model is presented, and the expressions for the required transmission power, outage probability, and block error rate are derived for the reverse link. The implications of the noise amplification caused by the deployment of the repeaters as well as the variation of the propagation loss have been taken into account. Results focus on determining the maximum load factor for a given outage probability. In particular, special attention is paid to the effect of key parameters such as the gain between the base station and the repeaters, denoted as coupling gain, and the location of the different repeaters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Model for the Reverse Link of WCDMA Systems With Repeaters in Nonuniform Traffic Distributions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2009541","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04682682.pdf","startPage":"2180","endPage":"2190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2009541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Model for the Reverse Link of WCDMA Systems With Repeaters in Nonuniform Traffic Distributions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4682682/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645563","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Model for the Reverse Link of WCDMA Systems With Repeaters in Nonuniform Traffic Distributions","sourcePdf":"tvt-adelantado-2009541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081284S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4682682","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4682692,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Sun Shin","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Sun","lastName":"Shin","id":"37279496600"},{"name":"Jung-Hwan Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Hwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280089700"},{"name":"Byoung-Nam Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Nam","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276228600"},{"name":"Seong-Ook Park","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Ook","lastName":"Park","id":"37280888400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4682692","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":609},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic materials","MIMO","Antenna measurements","Coaxial components","Magnetic resonance","Resonant frequency","Bandwidth","Gain measurement","Reverberation chamber","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","MIMO communication","monopole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monopole antenna","magneto-dielectric material","MIMO applications","microwave studio simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magneto-dash dielectric material","monopole antenna","multiple-input - multiple-output (MIMO)"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a monopole antenna with a magnetodielectric material and its multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) applications.

The salient feature of the proposed strategy is that it enables voltage balancing of the DC capacitors with no requirements for offline calculations, additional controls, or auxiliary power circuitry.

However, additional topologies and power systems are addressed to highlight differences, potentialities, and challenges of FCS-MPC. Among the conclusions are the feasibility and great potential of FCS-MPC due to present-day signal-processing capabilities, particularly for power systems with a reduced number of switching states and more complex operating principles, such as matrix converters. In addition, the possibility to address different or additional control objectives easily in a single cost function enables a simple, flexible, and improved performance controller for power-conversion systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2008349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2008349","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5062301/04682711.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control\u2014A Simple and Powerful Method to Control Power Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control\u2014A Simple and Powerful Method to Control Power Converters","volume":"56","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10713195","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4682711/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control\u2014A Simple and Powerful Method to Control Power Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-kouro-2008349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105465S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5062301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"1180","xplore-issue":"5062301","articleId":"4682711","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4682712,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Ren Peng","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Ren","lastName":"Peng","id":"37272682900"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279402000"},{"name":"Xiaoxia Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoxia","lastName":"Wu","id":"37311415000"},{"name":"Kai-Ming Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Ming","lastName":"Feng","id":"37364025900"},{"name":"Alan E.

With deliberately introducing I/Q imbalances and bias deviation, we have observed a 2- and 4-dB optical signal-to-noise ratio improvement, for the back-to-back and 800 km of uncompensated standard single-mode fiber transmission, respectively, with our proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/4745922/04682712.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2008.2008819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2008.2008819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation for I/Q Imbalances and Bias Deviation of the Mach\u2013Zehnder Modulators in Direct-Detected Optical OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical modulation","OFDM modulation","Optical distortion","Optical transmitters","Chromatic dispersion","Monitoring","Circuits","Costs","Proposals","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical communication equipment","optical distortion","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalances","Mach-Zehnder modulator","direct-detected optical OFDM system","equalization technique","fiber chromatic dispersion","MZM","single-mode fiber transmission","optical signal-to-noise ratio improvement","optical fiber communication","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM","bias deviation","distance 800 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","optical modulation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Compensation for I/Q Imbalances and Bias Deviation of the Mach\u2013Zehnder Modulators in Direct-Detected Optical OFDM Systems","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4682712/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10414940","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation for I/Q Imbalances and Bias Deviation of the Mach\u2013Zehnder Modulators in Direct-Detected Optical OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"lpt-peng-2008819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058305S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4745922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4745922","articleId":"4682712","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4682718,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4712525/4682718/4682718-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Bai received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctor Fellow at the University of Michigan, Dearborn.

For this design, new miniaturized elements for the FSS are developed to achieve low thickness solution and improved functionality. The proposed FSS enables implementation of higher order spatial filters over low-profile conformal antenna arrays. First, design of a very thin-layer modified miniaturized-element FSS producing a single-pole bandpass response in addition to a transmission zero is presented. The modified design is just a single-sided circuit board with a particular unit cell consisting of a loop centered within a wire grid. Next, using a similar metallic pattern on the other side of a very thin substrate, a dual-bandpass frequency response is produced. This response is achieved by choosing proper dimensions for the loops and wire of each layer and by appropriately positioning the layers with respect to each other. To establish a benchmark, dual-pole FSSs using cascaded layers of a previously designed miniaturized-element FSS are considered. In comparison, the modified dual-bandpass design has only two metal layers, instead of four, and a single substrate, instead of three. The proposed multipole FSS has a thickness of lambda/300 which is six times thinner than the benchmark structures. Moreover, the frequency response of the new FSS shows higher out-of-band rejection values. Performance of the multipole screens is tested by fabricating FSSs with maximally flat and dual-bandpass responses and measuring their frequency responses using a standard measurement setup in a free-space environment.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4696624/04682738.pdf","startPage":"2742","endPage":"2747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4696624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipole Spatial Filters Using Metamaterial-Based Miniaturized-Element Frequency-Selective Surfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682738/","displayDocTitle":"Multipole Spatial Filters Using Metamaterial-Based Miniaturized-Element Frequency-Selective Surfaces","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10349082","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4682738/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipole Spatial Filters Using Metamaterial-Based Miniaturized-Element Frequency-Selective Surfaces","sourcePdf":"56tmtt12-fbayatpur-2007332-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054987S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4696624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4696624","articleId":"4682738","onlineDate":"18 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4682810,"authors":[{"name":"Qingsong Li","affiliation":["College of Auto-mobile and trans Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Qingsong Li","id":"37087725691"},{"name":"Dan Qu","affiliation":["College of Auto-mobile and trans Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Dan Qu","id":"37087910864"},{"name":"Liming Du","affiliation":["College of Auto-mobile and trans Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Liming Du","id":"37087722526"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2012-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2013-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4682810","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4682810","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agile manufacturing","dynamic scheduling","genetic algorithms","job shop scheduling","multi-agent systems","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["job-shop dynamic scheduling","hybrid-genetic algorithm","MAS","multiagent system consultation","agile manufacturing","heuristic rule","task allocation","contract net protocol","global optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Job-shop Dynamic Scheduling","Hybrid-genetic Algorithm","Multi-Agent System (MAS)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SOLI.2008.4682810","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657348/4682741/04682810.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics","startPage":"1742","endPage":"1745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOLI.2008.4682810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on hybrid-genetic algorithm for MAS based job-shop dynamic scheduling","abstract":"Aimed at the job-shop dynamic scheduling for agile manufacturing, genetic algorithms and heuristic rules are combined; a job-shop dynamic scheduling model based on multi-agent and the hybrid-genetic algorithm is proposed.

Since stochastic programming is hard to solve by traditional methods, a hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm, which embeds the neutral network and stochastic simulation, is presented. To improve the performance of the algorithm, the probability of crossover and mutation will be adjusted according to the stage of evolution and fitness of the population. The solution procedure is tested on several randomly generated problems with varying parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm has strong adaptability.","doi":"10.1109/SOLI.2008.4682927","startPage":"2342","endPage":"2347","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657348/4682741/04682927.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOLI.2008.4682927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic dependent-chance programming model and hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm for vendor selection problem","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["financial management","genetic algorithms","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic dependent-chance programming model","hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm","vendor selection problem","stochastic simulation","purchasing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dependent-chance programming","hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm","vendor selection problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4682927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic dependent-chance programming model and hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm for vendor selection problem","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4682927/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400695","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic dependent-chance programming model and hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm for vendor selection problem","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048709S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657348","isNumber":"4682741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657348","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4682741","articleId":"4682927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4683139,"authors":[{"name":"Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed","affiliation":["Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Sheikh Iqbal","lastName":"Ahamed","id":"37270354900"},{"name":"Farzana Rahman","affiliation":["Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Farzana","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37628318600"},{"name":"Endadul Hoque","affiliation":["Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Endadul","lastName":"Hoque","id":"38266831300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3377-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1071-0485"}],"articleNumber":"4683139","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Authentication","Elliptic curve cryptography","Public key cryptography","Counterfeiting","RFID tags","Cryptographic protocols","Access protocols","Security","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message authentication","protocols","public key cryptography","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ERAP","ECC","RFID authentication protocol","RFID tags","counterfeiting problems","public key cryptography","public key cryptosystem","elliptic curve cryptography","RSA cryptographic system","mutual offline authentication protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID security","RFID authentication","ECC based RFID"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4683139","abstract":"RFID tags are a new generation of small devices used for identification in many applications today. RFID authentication plays an important role in applications where security and privacy is a major concern. As an example, RFID has gained appreciation as an emerging technology to thwart counterfeiting problems. Public key cryptography (PKC) provides an impeccable solution to the counterfeiting problem. One recent family of public key cryptosystem is elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) which is a better choice than RSA cryptographic system because of its shorter key length. In this paper, we propose a secure, mutual offline authentication protocol which is based on ECC.

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a popular swarm algorithm, which has exhibited good performance on many optimization problems.

In the DMPSO, firstly, the population is divided into two groups, and some special operations - dynamic crossover and dynamic mutation are employed in the evaluation. The DMPSO algorithm was used in the training process of neural network, and compared to other three different types of NN training algorithms, and the experiment results show that the new algorithm performances better on two representative types of application of neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICINIS.2008.136","startPage":"103","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINIS.2008.136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4683146","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4683145/4683146/04683178.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Mutation PSO algorithm and its Application in the Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683178/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Mutation PSO algorithm and its Application in the Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4683178/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10397023","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Mutation PSO algorithm and its Application in the Neural Networks","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3391a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033328S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4683145","isNumber":"4683146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4683145","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4683146","articleId":"4683178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4683179,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Fu","affiliation":["Shanghai Univ. of Electr.

The method is rooted in different characters between instantaneous radial velocity of sea current and moving target, and relies on the neural network for its implementation. By estimating the instantaneous velocity of sea current and target, we find that a spatial nonlinear model rather than deterministic chaos model is more appropriate to describe the relationship among radial velocities of neighbor sea areas. Then we built a neural network model to approach to a predictor for sea clutter. So an incoming target will be detected for its more predicted error than a certain threshold. The method performs well on ocean echo data acquired by the HF radar system OSMAR2003.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683298/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10397142","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4683298/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Target Detection Based on Sea Clutter Model Using Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target Detection Based on Sea Clutter Model Using Neural Network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3391a600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043286S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4683145","isNumber":"4683146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4683145","xplore-issue":"4683146","articleId":"4683298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4683304,"authors":[{"name":"Jiancang Ma","affiliation":["China"],"firstName":"Jiancang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37836291700"},{"name":"Xiaobing Zhang","firstName":"Xiaobing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37879235100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3391-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4683304","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing algorithms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Computational complexity","Cost function","Biomedical signal processing","Intelligent networks","Covariance matrix","Source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","computational complexity","covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation algorithm","maximum signal noise ratio","computational complexity","instantaneous linear mixture signal","source signal","separation contrast","estimate signal","covariance matrices","generalized eigenvalue problem","unmixing matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind source separation","generalized Eigenvalue","moving average","signal noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"A low computational complexity instantaneous linear mixture signals blind separation algorithm was proposed, which is based on the character that Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) is maximal when statistically independent source signals are completely separated, and it is used as a separation contrast.

Owing to the high satellite speed, the clutter contains a broad mixture of radial velocities within the antenna beam, leading to a large Doppler spread. Effective clutter suppression can solely be achieved by multiple aperture or phase center antennas. For space-based systems, however, the number of receiver channels connected to subapertures is very limited due to their weight, volume, and high data rates (current systems such as TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 possess only two). This classical along-track interferometry architecture, in which the antenna is split into two halves, achieves only suboptimum GMTI performance. This paper presents and statistically analyzes an innovative approach to create additional independent phase centers to improve the GMTI performance considerably. The extra degrees of freedom are created by cyclical phase and amplitude switchings of the transmit/receive modules for transmitter and receiver between pulses, hence trading Doppler bandwidth for extra spatial diversity. In the first part of this paper, different strategies of spatial-temporal diversity are introduced and analyzed for realistic system parameters with respect to ambiguities and detection performance. The second part is concerned with the elaborate theoretical analysis of the relocation improvement for the spatial diversity approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10359892","htmlLink":"/document/4683338/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Space-Based Moving Target Indication via Alternate Transmission and Receiver Switching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Space-Based Moving Target Indication via Alternate Transmission and Receiver Switching","sourcePdf":"tgrs-gierull-2002266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088088S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4683335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4683335","articleId":"4683338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4683339,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Hecker","affiliation":["International Institute of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, Enschede, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4683335/4683339/4683339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christoph Hecker was born in 1974.

This effect can be partially neutralized by using appropriate preprocessing methods. Two different types of spectral subsetting of the data, two types of continuum removal, and a combination thereof were tested.

The basic idea is to apply an MS to obtain an object-oriented representation of hyperspectral data and then use support vector machine to interpret the feature set. In order to employ MS for hyperspectral data effectively, a feature-extraction algorithm, nonnegative matrix factorization, is utilized to reduce the high-dimensional feature space. Furthermore, two bandwidth-selection algorithms are proposed for the MS procedure. One is based on the local structures, and the other exploits separability analysis. Experiments are conducted on two hyperspectral data sets, the DC Mall hyperspectral digital-imagery collection experiment and the Purdue campus hyperspectral mapper images. We evaluate and compare the proposed approach with the well-known commercial software eCognition (object-based analysis approach) and an effective spectral/spatial classifier for hyperspectral data, namely, the derivative of the morphological profile. Experimental results show that the proposed MS-based analysis system is robust and obviously outperforms the other methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2002577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4683335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2002577","endPage":"4185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4683335/04683346.pdf","startPage":"4173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Mean-Shift Analysis Approach for Object Extraction and Classification From Urban Hyperspectral Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683346/","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Mean-Shift Analysis Approach for Object Extraction and Classification From Urban Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"46","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10359900","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4683346/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Mean-Shift Analysis Approach for Object Extraction and Classification From Urban Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2002577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091446S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4683335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"4683335","articleId":"4683346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4683348,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Zhong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Automatic Target Recognition, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4683335/4683348/4683348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ping Zhong received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the National Key Laboratory of Automatic Target Recognition, School of Electronic Science and Engineering.","His research interests include image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37289138300"},{"name":"Runsheng Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Automatic Target Recognition, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4683335/4683348/4683348-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Runsheng Wang graduated from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1964.","From January 1984 to June 1986 and from October 1992 to April 1993, he was a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

This paper presents a sparse conditional random field (SCRF) model to select relevant features for the classification of hyperspectral images and, meanwhile, to exploit the contextual information in the form of spatial dependences in the images. The sparsity arises from the use of a Laplacian prior on the CRF parameters, which encourages the parameter estimates to be either significantly large or exactly zero. To joint the feature selection and classifier design, this paper develops an efficient sparse training method, which divides the training of SCRF into the sparse trainings of two simpler classifiers.

The synthetic transmission lines used to achieve the analog delay in FFE filters also suffer from performance issues such as limited bandwidth, impedance mismatches, and nonlinearities which degrade the efficacy of the filter.

Operationally, L-DEP and D-DEP typically require application of AC voltages across a pair of coplanar microelectrodes for a very short duration of time (~50 ms). The feedback control scheme, utilized to control the droplet dispensing and transport, relies on a CMOS optical sensor to detect perturbations in the light intensity induced by the liquid finger or spherical droplet, as they traverse over the optical sensor and interact with the incident illumination. A fully functional prototype was developed and its operation successfully tested using example L-DEP and D-DEP structures.","doi":"10.1109/MNRC.2008.4683397","publicationTitle":"2008 1st Microsystems and Nanoelectronics Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 1st Microsystems and Nanoelectronics Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674378/4683356/04683397.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNRC.2008.4683397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4683356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS Optical feedback control for high-speed DEP based microfluidic actuation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4683397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683397/","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Optical feedback control for high-speed DEP based microfluidic actuation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398211","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4683397/","conferenceDate":"15-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Optical feedback control for high-speed DEP based microfluidic actuation","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041214S","chronDate":"15-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674378","isNumber":"4683356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674378","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4683356","articleId":"4683397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4683401,"authors":[{"name":"Lotfi Mejri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Lotfi","lastName":"Mejri","id":"37567314500"},{"name":"Adel Omar Dahmane","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Adel Omar","lastName":"Dahmane","id":"37392233800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2920-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2921-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4683401","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Frequency","Feedback","Multiple access interference","Multiuser detection","Interference cancellation","Arithmetic","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","field programmable gate arrays","interference suppression","multiuser detection","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","MPIC detector","DS-CDMA system","frequency nonselective channel","multiuser detection","direct-sequence code division multiple access system","multiple access interference","multistage parallel interference cancellation","decision feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DS-CDMA","MPIC","Decision feedback","FPGA implementation"]}],"abstract":"Multiuser detection (MUD) techniques are mandatory in direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems.

A passive temperature compensation method is also utilized by including the buried oxide layer of the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate in the structural resonant body of the device, and a very small (-2.4 ppm/degC) temperature coefficient of frequency is obtained for an 82-MHz oscillator.y including the buried oxide layer of the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate in the structural resonant body of the device, and a very small (-2.4 ppm/degC) temperature coefficient of frequency is obtained for an 82-MHz oscillator.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4683454/04683468.pdf","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2008.976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2008.976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4683454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4683468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon resonators for high-frequency reference oscillator applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Piezoelectric films","Oscillators","Temperature","Impedance","Acoustic applications","Acoustic devices","Assembly","Acoustic measurements","Power amplifiers","Resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic impedance","acoustic resonators","crystal resonators","oscillators","piezoelectric thin films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thin film piezoelectric-on-silicon resonators","high-frequency reference oscillator","bulk acoustic resonators","motional impedance","transimpedance amplifier","temperature compensation","frequency 82 MHz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acoustics","Algorithms","Electric Impedance","Electrochemistry","Electronics","Equipment Design","Mechanics","Microelectrodes","Micromanipulation","Nonlinear Dynamics","Oscillometry","Oxides","Silicon","Temperature","Transistors, Electronic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon resonators for high-frequency reference oscillator applications","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4683468/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370846","pubMedId":"19126485","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon resonators for high-frequency reference oscillator applications","sourcePdf":"t08c2596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094852S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4683454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4683454","articleId":"4683468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4683470,"authors":[{"name":"Hideyuki Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4683454/4683470/4683470-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hideyuki Hasegawa was born in Oyama, Japan, in 1973.

We have developed a phase-sensitive correlation-based method, namely, the phased-tracking method, to measure the regional radial strain. On the other hand, the measurement of blood flow is an important practical routine in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis. It would be useful if the regional strain of the arterial wall as well as blood flow could be assessed simultaneously. Such measurement would require a high frame rate of several kilohertz. In this study, acquisition of ultrasonic RF echoes at a high frame rate (about 3500 Hz) was achieved using parallel beamforming in which plane waves were transmitted only 3 times and receive beamforming created 24 beams for each transmit beam. The accuracy in measurement of the minute radial strain was evaluated by a basic experiment using a cylindrical phantom. The error of the measured strain from the theoretical strain profile and its standard deviation were 4.8% and 9.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the radial strain of a carotid arterial wall and blood flow were simultaneously imaged in vivo.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","volume":"55","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10370845","pubMedId":"19126487","publicationDate":"December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4683470/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous imaging of artery-wall strain and blood flow by high frame rate acquisition of RF signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous imaging of artery-wall strain and blood flow by high frame rate acquisition of RF signals","sourcePdf":"t08c2626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.212406S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4683454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4683454","articleId":"4683470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4683471,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Zahiri-Azar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4683454/4683471/4683471-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Zahiri Azar (S'05) received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, and the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 2005 under the supervision of S.

As a result of technological advances that enable small feature sizes and a high level of integration, nonfluoroscopic intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) imaging catheters are attracting increasing attention. ICE catheters improve EP procedural guidance while reducing the undesirable use of fluoroscopy, which is currently the common catheter guidance method. Phased-array ICE catheters have been in use for several years now, although only for side-looking imaging. We are developing a forwardlooking ICE catheter for improved visualization. In this effort, we fabricate a 24-element, fine-pitch 1-D array of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUT), with a total footprint of 1.73 mm x 1.27 mm. We also design a custom integrated circuit (IC) composed of 24 identical blocks of transmit/ receive circuitry, measuring 2.1 mm x 2.1 mm. The transmit circuitry is capable of delivering 25-V unipolar pulses, and the receive circuitry includes a transimpedance preamplifier followed by an output buffer. The CMUT array and the custom IC are designed to be mounted at the tip of a 10-Fr catheter for high-frame-rate forward-looking intracardiac imaging. Through-wafer vias incorporated in the CMUT array provide access to individual array elements from the back side of the array. We successfully flip-chip bond a CMUT array to the custom IC with 100% yield. We coat the device with a layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to electrically isolate the device for imaging in water and tissue. The pulse-echo in water from a total plane reflector has a center frequency of 9.2 MHz with a 96% fractional bandwidth. Finally, we demonstrate the imaging capability of the integrated device on commercial phantoms and on a beating ex vivo rabbit heart (Langendorff model) using a commercial ultrasound imaging system.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2008.980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4683454/04683472.pdf","startPage":"2651","endPage":"2660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2008.980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4683454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward-looking intracardiac ultrasound imaging using a 1-D CMUT array integrated with custom front-end electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4683472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4683472/","displayDocTitle":"Forward-looking intracardiac ultrasound imaging using a 1-D CMUT array integrated with custom front-end electronics","volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370848","pubMedId":"19126489","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4683472/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward-looking intracardiac ultrasound imaging using a 1-D CMUT array integrated with custom front-end electronics","sourcePdf":"t08c2651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105719S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4683454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4683454","articleId":"4683472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684296,"authors":[{"name":"Raman Mathur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Raman Mathur received the B.E. degree from M.B.M.

Higher signal switching speeds and increased aspect ratios of interconnects in chips has enforced the attention towards non conventional faults due to the coupling noise between adjacent interconnects. Crosstalk is one such major Signal Integrity issue, that can occur intermittently or permanently, which may lead to functional problems and even occasionally for failure of the chip. Testing the chips for such faults is essential even after manufacturing with certain design constraints to ensure the quality of the chip. Predetermined test patterns are necessary for testing such crosstalk related faults. In this paper, an elitist genetic algorithm has been developed to determine the test patterns for worst-case crosstalk faults. Fitness functions for all basic gates also based on the level of the gates have been developed. The algorithm was performed on some benchmark circuits and the determined test patterns were also verified.","doi":"10.1109/ESTC.2008.4684381","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658784/4684310/04684381.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"402","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd Electronics System-Integration Technology Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd Electronics System-Integration Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTC.2008.4684381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test pattern generation for worst-case crosstalk faults in DSM chips using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Test pattern generation for worst-case crosstalk faults in DSM chips using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10397498","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4684381/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test pattern generation for worst-case crosstalk faults in DSM chips using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Greenwich, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140365S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658784","isNumber":"4684310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658784","xplore-issue":"4684310","articleId":"4684381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4684482,"authors":[{"name":"Kiyokazu Yasuda","affiliation":["Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Kiyokazu Yasuda","id":"37728679500"},{"name":"Kunio Ota","affiliation":["Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Kunio Ota","id":"37868305900"},{"name":"Michiya Matsushima","affiliation":["Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Michiya Matsushima","id":"37337663300"},{"name":"Kozo Fujimoto","affiliation":["Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Kozo Fujimoto","id":"37556793200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2813-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2814-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4684482","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical waveguides","High speed optical techniques","Optical interconnections","Optical fiber communication","Electromagnetic waveguides","Refractive index","Frequency","Optical attenuators","Optical distortion","Large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient index optics","optical interconnections","optical waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bended interconnection","graded index optical waveguide","high speed optical communication","multimode waveguides","periodic loss","ray tracing method","correction curve","elliptic curve"]}],"abstract":"The interchip information transmission by the optical signal is promising in the band of 10 GHz or more in the future.

In this study, it was clarified that the power loss was small regardless of a small curvature.

Unfortunately, BD requires either global channel state information at every receiver or an additional training phase, which demands additional control overhead and additional system planning. In this paper we propose a new multiuser MIMO algorithm that combines BD with vector perturbation (VP). The proposed algorithm avoids the second training phase, reduces each user is receiver complexity thanks to pre-equalization with VP at the transmitter, and has comparable diversity performance to BD with maximum likelihood decoding algorithm. A bound on the achievable sum rate for the proposed technique is derived and used to show that BD with VP approaches the achievable sum rate of BD with water-filling. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed technique provides better bit error rate and diversity performance than BD with a zero-forcing receiver as well as BD with zero-forcing precoding.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684576.pdf","startPage":"4051","endPage":"4057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Diagonalized Vector Perturbation for Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684576/","displayDocTitle":"Block Diagonalized Vector Perturbation for Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348397","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684576/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Diagonalized Vector Perturbation for Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"4051-tw0811-chae.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096325S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684577,"authors":[{"name":"Eduard A.

Next, the impact of the fading variances of the users on an upper bound of the sum rate for space division multiple access (SDMA) based opportunistic beamforming is derived which is tight for high SNR.

With a low training overhead, the simplified turbo RLS channel estimation provides a performance comparable to the case with perfect channel state information (CSI).","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684583.pdf","startPage":"4094","endPage":"4099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070570","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070570","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684583","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multiuser detection","Least squares approximation","Resonance light scattering","Equalizers","Phase shift keying","Iterative decoding","MIMO","Time domain analysis","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency-domain analysis","least squares approximations","multiuser detection","phase shift keying","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity adaptive turbo frequency-domain channel estimation","single-carrier multi-user detection","low complexity turbo space-frequency equalization","turbo recursive least square channel estimation algorithm","complexity reduction","PSK modulations","channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","frequency domain equalization (FDE)","multiple-user detection","Turbo equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Adaptive Turbo Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation for Single-Carrier Multi-User Detection","accessionNumber":"10348404","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4684583/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Adaptive Turbo Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation for Single-Carrier Multi-User Detection","sourcePdf":"4094-tw0811-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051561S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4684586,"authors":[{"name":"Sili Lu","affiliation":["University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Sili","lastName":"Lu","id":"38271424500"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir","id":"37269044000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4684586","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":518},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Digital video broadcasting","Channel estimation","Time domain analysis","Frequency estimation","Sparse matrices","Equalizers","Finite impulse response filter","Frequency domain analysis","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital video broadcasting","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","mobile television","OFDM modulation","sparse matrices","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent ICI cancellation","differential ICI cancellation","mobile OFDM","frequency domain channel estimation algorithm","time-domain channel estimation algorithm","intercarrier interference","sparse channel matrix","digital video broadcasting-handheld system","DVB-H"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ICI mitigation","OFDM","channel estimation","doppler shift"]}],"abstract":"We develop a reduced-complexity hybrid frequency/time-domain orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel estimation algorithm for high-mobility scenarios where the channel varies significantly within each OFDM block, resulting in severe intercarrier interference (ICI).

Due to its simplicity and usefulness, the SIC structure has received significant attention for several years. In this letter, we make three contributions to the understanding of this receiver structure. First, we derive a closed form expression for received power profile of linear SIC with arbitrary spreading gain and SINR requirements. Second, using this expression we examine the performance of SIC under various ordering criteria based on spreading gain, path loss, and SINR/BER requirement. Third, we show that using a very simple and well-known sorting algorithm, we can obtain a cancellation order and set of power control levels which are very near the optimum in terms of minimizing total transmit power.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684589.pdf","startPage":"4128","endPage":"4132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effects of Ordering Criteria in Linear Successive Interference Cancellation in CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Silicon carbide","Signal to noise ratio","Multiuser detection","Matched filters","Performance loss","Performance gain","Bit error rate","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear successive interference cancellation","CDMA system","multiuser detection","code division multiple access","matched filter receiver","ordering criteria","path loss","BER requirement","SINR requirement","sorting algorithm","spreading gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","successive interference cancellation (SIC)","ordering criteria"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Ordering Criteria in Linear Successive Interference Cancellation in CDMA Systems","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4684589/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348410","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Ordering Criteria in Linear Successive Interference Cancellation in CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"4128-tw0811-mohammad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09478S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4684590,"authors":[{"name":"Khairi Ashour Hamdi","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Khairi Ashour","lastName":"Hamdi","id":"37297892800"},{"name":"Pongsatorn Sedtheetorn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mahidol University, Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pongsatorn","lastName":"Sedtheetorn","id":"37298539600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4684590","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"A new accurate mathematical analysis is presented for the efficient computation of the spectral efficiency of CDMA downlink wireless communication systems in the presence of multipath Rayleigh fading and log-normal shadowing.

This is used to investigate the performance of downlink CDMA in different multipath delay profiles. The numerical results has shown that the loss of orthogonality deteriorates the spectral efficiency significantly at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) levels.

Particularly, when multiple users are active, the impact can be high. Linear precoding and non-linear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) are thus developed for spatially-multiplexed multiuser OFDM and orthogonal space-time block-coded (OSTBC) OFDM. The proposed precoders employ a limited feedback structure, which is implemented with a shared codebook of precoding matrices, and only the index of the selected optimal matrix is fed back to the transmitter. The conventional limited feedback design criterion for flat-fading MIMO channels is only applicable to single-user OFDM without frequency offsets. We show that the ICI matrix due to frequency offset does not impact users precoding individually, and precoding on a per-subcarrier basis is possible. Exploiting this property, the conventional design is generalized to multiuser OFDM with frequency offsets. Nonlinear precoding uses a modulo arithmetic precoding matrix (which reduces the power efficiency loss inherent in linear precoding and leads to a lower error rate) and outperforms linear precoding. Our precoders not only offer significant bit error rate (BER) improvement for spatially-multiplexed multiuser MIMO OFDM with frequency offsets, but are equally effective for both OSTBC MIMO OFDM and spatially correlated channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited-Feedback Precoding for Closed-Loop Multiuser MIMO OFDM Systems with Frequency Offsets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.060868","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684592.pdf","startPage":"4155","endPage":"4165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.060868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"Limited-Feedback Precoding for Closed-Loop Multiuser MIMO OFDM Systems with Frequency Offsets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4684592/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348413","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited-Feedback Precoding for Closed-Loop Multiuser MIMO OFDM Systems with Frequency Offsets","sourcePdf":"4155-tw0811-fu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08765S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4684595,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lan Huang","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Beijing, China","Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4684572/4684595/4684595-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Lan Huang (S'04-M'07) was born in Hunan, China, in August 1982.

In this paper, we propose a channel state information (CSI) based random access protocol that takes advantage of multi-packet reception (MPR) in IEEE 802.11-like wireless local area networks (WLANs). Specifically, the proposed MAC protocol dynamically adjusts each nodes transmission probability according to the network population, estimated channel condition, as well as the maximum number of packets that can be simultaneously decoded. System throughput is analyzed by taking adaptive modulation and transmission errors into consideration. Based on such analytical result, an optimal transmission policy is derived to maximize the system throughput. In addition, the impact of imperfect CSI on the throughput performance is investigated and the tradeoff between the CSI quality and average SNR at the receiver is demonstrated. It is shown that compared with the schemes using conventional models, our proposed approach can significantly increase the throughput without sacrificing system resources such as bandwidth and transmission energy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684595.pdf","startPage":"4185","endPage":"4197","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel State Based Random Access and Adaptive Modulation in Wireless LANs with Multi-Packet Reception","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel State Based Random Access and Adaptive Modulation in Wireless LANs with Multi-Packet Reception","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4684595/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348416","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel State Based Random Access and Adaptive Modulation in Wireless LANs with Multi-Packet Reception","sourcePdf":"4185-tw0811-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083119S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4684596,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We address this issue by developing a framework to evaluate the interference profile at a legacy receiver under different system scenarios which include the hidden node and imperfect-sensing problems. By analyzing the interference distributions and by comparing the two basic approaches to SS - interference-avoidance-based overlay and interference averaging-based underlay - we identify desirable characteristics for SS radio systems.We then leverage this knowledge to motivate the use of a hybrid SS approach that combines the benefits of the two basic approaches and substantially reduces the impact to the legacy system. The advantage provided by this approach is shown to increase with an increase in the bandwidth available to the SS system. In addition, the approach is more robust to imperfect information. The inclusion of log-normal shadowing is shown to further accentuate these performance trends.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10348417","htmlLink":"/document/4684596/","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Techniques on Legacy Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Techniques on Legacy Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"4198-tw0811-menon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085743S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4684599,"authors":[{"name":"Furuzan Atay Onat","affiliation":["Broadband Communications and Wireless Systems (BCWS) Centre, Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4684572/4684599/4684599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Furuzan Atay Onat received the B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey and the M.S degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rutgers University, New Jersey, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.

In the SNR-based selective relaying, the relay either retransmits or remains silent depending on the SNRs of the source-relay, relay-destination, and source-destination links. Different models assuming the availability of different sets of instantaneous and average SNR information at the relay are studied. For each model, the optimal strategy to minimize the e2e BER is a different threshold rule on the source-relay SNR, if the link SNRs are uncorrelated in time and space. Approximations for the optimal threshold values that minimize the e2e BER and the resulting performance are derived analytically for BPSK modulation. Using the derived threshold the e2e BER can be reduced significantly compared to simple digital relaying. By studying the performance under different models, it is shown that knowledge of the instantaneous source-destination SNR at the relay can be exploited. The gain from this knowledge is higher when the average source-destination SNR is large. However, knowledge of the instantaneous relay-destination SNR at the relay does not change performance significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684599.pdf","startPage":"4226","endPage":"4237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold Selection for SNR-based Selective Digital Relaying in Cooperative Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital relays","Wireless networks","Bit error rate","Binary phase shift keying","Wireless communication","Diversity reception","Data mining","Signal to noise ratio","Digital modulation","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shift keying","signal processing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold selection","selective digital relaying","cooperative wireless networks","BPSK modulation","instantaneous relay-destination SNR","multihop communication","cooperative diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multihop communication","cooperative diversity","threshold based digital relaying","selective digital relaying","SNR based selective relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Threshold Selection for SNR-based Selective Digital Relaying in Cooperative Wireless Networks","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4684599/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348420","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold Selection for SNR-based Selective Digital Relaying in Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"4226-tw0811-onat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071349S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684601,"authors":[{"name":"Toshiaki Koike Akino","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4684572/4684601/4684601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Toshiaki Koike Akino received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Kyoto University, Japan, in 2002.

A high-order exponential-weighted recursive least-squares (EW-RLS) method has been known as a good channel estimation scheme in rapid fading. However, there exists a drawback that we need to properly adjust the estimation parameters of a forgetting factor and an estimation order according to the channel environment. In this paper, we theoretically derive an optimum-weighted LS (OW-LS) channel estimation based on the statistical knowledge of the spatio-temporal channel correlation. Through the analysis, we reveal that the zero-th order polynomial becomes optimal when the optimum-weighting is employed. Furthermore, we propose an efficient recursive algorithm for channel tracking in order to reduce the computational complexity. Since the proposed scheme automatically adapts the weighting coefficients to the channel condition, it has a significant advantage in mean-square error (MSE) performance compared to the EW-RLS scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684601.pdf","startPage":"4248","endPage":"4260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum-Weighted RLS Channel Estimation for Rapid Fading MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance light scattering","Channel estimation","Fading","MIMO","Polynomials","Mobile communication","Parameter estimation","Additive noise","Computational complexity","Radio communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","fading channels","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum-weighted RLS channel estimation","fading MIMO channel","multiple-input multiple-output system","mobile communication","high-order exponential-weighted method","recursive least-squares method","estimation parameter","spatiotemporal channel correlation","zero-th order polynomial","computational complexity","mean-square error method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Weighted least-squares (LS) channel estimation","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","optimum-weighting","recursive algorithm","fast fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimum-Weighted RLS Channel Estimation for Rapid Fading MIMO Channels","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4684601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348422","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum-Weighted RLS Channel Estimation for Rapid Fading MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"4248-tw0811-akino.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150867S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684603,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4684572/4684603/4684603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dusit Niyato (S'05) is currently an assistant professor in the School of Computer Engineering, at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

This is referred to as spectrum trading. In spectrum trading, pricing is a key issue of interest to primary service providers (i.e., spectrum sellers) as well as to secondary service providers (i.e., spectrum buyers). In a cognitive radio network, pricing model for spectrum sharing depends on the objective of spectrum trading, and therefore, the behaviors of spectrum sellers and spectrum buyers. In this paper, we investigate three different pricing models, namely, market-equilibrium, competitive, and cooperative pricing models for spectrum trading in a cognitive radio environment. In these pricing models, the primary service providers have different behaviors (i.e., competitive and cooperative behaviors) to achieve different objectives of spectrum trading. Specifically, in marketequilibrium pricing model, the objective of spectrum trading is to satisfy spectrum demand from the secondary users, and there is neither competition nor cooperation among primary service providers. In the competitive pricing, the objective is to maximize the individual profit, and there is competition among primary service providers. In cooperative pricing, the objective of spectrum trading is to maximize the total profit, and cooperation exists among primary service providers. We propose distributed algorithms to achieve the pricing solutions of these different pricing models and analyze stability of these distributed algorithms. We perform extensive performance analysis of these pricing algorithms considering different aspects such as profit of the primary service providers, stability region, and impact of number of primary service providers, which reveals interesting insights into the spectrum trading problem.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684603.pdf","startPage":"4273","endPage":"4283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Market-Equilibrium, Competitive, and Cooperative Pricing for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks: Analysis and Comparison","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684603/","displayDocTitle":"Market-Equilibrium, Competitive, and Cooperative Pricing for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks: Analysis and Comparison","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348424","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684603/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Market-Equilibrium, Competitive, and Cooperative Pricing for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks: Analysis and Comparison","sourcePdf":"4273-tw0811-niyato.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054546S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684604,"authors":[{"name":"David P.

In the tracking stage, we develop a refined decision-feedback (DF) DFT-based channel estimation method in which a few pilot tones inserted in OFDM data symbols are applied to form an optimal gradient vector at the first iteration such that the error propagation effect is mitigated. In order to reduce computational complexity, an approximate weighting matrix is adopted to avoid matrix inversion. We demonstrate the proposed method through computer simulation of an STBC/OFDM system with two transmit antennas and a single receive antenna. The results show that our method outperforms the classical DFT-based method, the STBC-based minimum mean square error (MMSE) method, and the Kalman filtering method as well, and that significant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance improvement can be achieved, especially when a high-level modulation scheme, e.g. 16QAM, is adopted in high-mobility environments.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684607.pdf","startPage":"4312","endPage":"4320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Refined Channel Estimation Method for STBC/OFDM Systems in High-Mobility Wireless Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684607/","displayDocTitle":"A Refined Channel Estimation Method for STBC/OFDM Systems in High-Mobility Wireless Channels","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348428","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684607/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Refined Channel Estimation Method for STBC/OFDM Systems in High-Mobility Wireless Channels","sourcePdf":"4312-tw0811-ku.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07949S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684607","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4684608,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4684572/4684608/4684608-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongxiang Li (S'03) received a B.S. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China in 2000, a M.S. degree from Ohio University in 2004, and a Ph.D. degree from University of Washington, Seattle in 2008, all in electrical engineering.

In particular, we present a dirty-paper coding (DPC) based overlay architecture to enable interference-free reception of unicast signals. The fundamental limits of hybrid communications are investigated, along with power allocation algorithms that approach the hybrid capacity. Our results show that OFDMA for unicast offers the best hybrid performance and considerable gains over orthogonal multiplexing (e.g., TDM/FDM) can be achieved through interference-free overlay.

The proposed synchronization method consists of sync detection, coarse timing estimation, fine timing estimation, and oscillator frequency offset estimation. The distinctive features of MB-OFDM systems and the interplay between the timing and carrier frequency hopping at the receiver are judiciously incorporated in the proposed synchronization method. In order to apply the low complexity one-tap frequency-domain equalizer, the required circular convolution property of the received signal is obtained by means of an overlap-add method after the frequency offset compensation. The proposed low complexity channel estimator for each band is developed by first averaging the over-lapadded received preamble symbols within the same band and then applying time-domain least-squares method followed by the discrete Fourier transform. We develop an MMSE equalizer and its approximate version with low complexity. We also derive the probability density functions of the UWB channel path delays, and using them we present several optimization criteria for our proposed synchronization, channel estimation, and equalization. The effectiveness of our proposed methods and optimization criteria are confirmed by computer simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684610.pdf","startPage":"4341","endPage":"4352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization, Channel Estimation, and Equalization in MB-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684610/","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization, Channel Estimation, and Equalization in MB-OFDM Systems","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348431","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684610/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization, Channel Estimation, and Equalization in MB-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"4341-tw0811-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075381S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684611,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4684572/4684611/4684611-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Chen received his BSc degree in applied physics from Jinan University, P.

It consists of two processes: interpolation and factorisation. By first defining a Hermitian curve, these processes can be implemented with an iterative polynomial construction algorithm and a recursive coefficient search algorithm respectively. To improve the efficiency of list decoding Hermitian codes, this paper presents two contributions to reduce the interpolation complexity. First, in order to simplify the calculation of a polynomialiquests zero condition during the iterative interpolation, we propose an algorithm to determine the corresponding coefficients between the pole basis monomials and zero basis functions of a Hermitian curve. Second, we propose a modified complexity reducing interpolation algorithm. This scheme identifies any unnecessary polynomials during iterations and eliminates them to improve the interpolation efficiency. Due to the above complexity reducing modifications, list decoding long Hermitian codes with higher interpolation multiplicity becomes feasible. This paper shows list decoding algorithm can achieve significant coding gain over the conventional unique decoding algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Iterative algorithms","Iterative decoding","Polynomials","Error correction codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Poles and zeros","Reed-Solomon codes","Communication industry","Construction industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic geometric codes","interpolation","iterative decoding","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced complexity interpolation","interpolation efficiency","list decoding","Hermitian codes","Guruswami-Sudan algorithm","iterative polynomial construction","recursive coefficient search","Hermitian curve","algebraic geometric codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["List decoding","hermitian codes","decoding efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684611.pdf","startPage":"4353","endPage":"4361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Complexity Interpolation for List Decoding Hermitian Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Complexity Interpolation for List Decoding Hermitian Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684611/","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684611/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10348432","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Complexity Interpolation for List Decoding Hermitian Codes","sourcePdf":"4353-tw0811-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0618S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4684612,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Exploiting the GNSS signal model structure and the spreading code periodicity, we develop an efficient implementation of the Newton iterative likelihood maximization method by finding simple analytical expressions for the first and second derivatives of the likelihood function. The proposed fast iterative ML algorithm (FIMLA) for timedelay estimation, which uses the correlation function of the received signal with its local replica, is shown to be an attractive technique for mitigation of closely-spaced multipath arrivals. For the future modernized GPS and the European Galileo signals based on binary offset carrier (BOC) waveforms, the correlation function has multiple positive and negative peaks leading to potential tracking ambiguities. Instead of the standard crosscorrelation, we propose an implementation characterized by a different choice of the local replica so as to cancel the sub-carrier phase, thus eliminating ambiguities. The asymptotic performance of FIMLA is analyzed by deriving the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Representative simulation examples are included to illustrate the FIMLA is performance for delay estimations in the presence of multipath for both C/A code and BOC signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Iterative Maximum-Likelihood Algorithm (FIMLA) for Multipath Mitigation in the Next Generation of GNSS Receivers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070700","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684612.pdf","startPage":"4362","endPage":"4374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684612/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast Iterative Maximum-Likelihood Algorithm (FIMLA) for Multipath Mitigation in the Next Generation of GNSS Receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4684612/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348433","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Iterative Maximum-Likelihood Algorithm (FIMLA) for Multipath Mitigation in the Next Generation of GNSS Receivers","sourcePdf":"4362-tw0811-sahmoudi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123046S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4684614,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Zhang","affiliation":["South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4684572/4684614/4684614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Zhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Radio Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology in 2004.

The accuracy of channel estimation directly affects the performance of the overall system. In this paper, we present some practical techniques to improve channel estimation in up-link MC-CDMA systems. For most of multipath channels, there are only a few significant taps in time domain that determine the frequency response. Based on this characteristic, we detect and keep these significant taps and discard the trivial ones, which are usually very noisy or contain only noise components. After channel parameters are estimated at the pilot blocks, channels at the data blocks can be obtained by interpolation. To improve the performance of simple linear interpolation, we apply optimal interpolation, which takes channel estimation error and channel correlation into consideration. We then investigate the impact of channel estimation error on minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector and find that more accurate channel is required to further improve the performance of the MMSE SIC detector. Therefore, we develop soft-decision-directed (SDD) channel estimation, which exploits the information at the data blocks to improve channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4684572/04684614.pdf","startPage":"4384","endPage":"4392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Considerations on Channel Estimation for Up-Link MC-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684614/","displayDocTitle":"Practical Considerations on Channel Estimation for Up-Link MC-CDMA Systems","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348435","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684614/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Considerations on Channel Estimation for Up-Link MC-CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"4384-tw0811-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073341S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4684572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4684572","articleId":"4684614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684619,"authors":[{"name":"Aydin Babakhani","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4684618/4684619/4684619-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aydin Babakhani (S'03\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003.

Exploiting the advantages yielded by operating the core transistors in class-C, a theoretical 3.9 dB phase noise improvement compared to the standard differential-pair LC-tank oscillator is achieved for the same current consumption. Further benefits derive from the natural rejection of the tail bias current noise, and from the absence of parasitic nodes sensitive to stray capacitances. Closed-form phase-noise equations obtained from a rigorous time-variant circuit analysis are presented, as well as a time-variant study of the stability of the oscillation amplitude, resulting in simple guidelines for a reliable design. Furthermore, the analysis of phase noise is extended to encompass a general harmonic oscillator, showing that all phase noise relations previously obtained for specific LC oscillator topologies are special cases of a very general and remarkably simple result.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684621/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","volume":"43","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10416774","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4684621/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Class-C Harmonic CMOS VCOs, With a General Result on Phase Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class-C Harmonic CMOS VCOs, With a General Result on Phase Noise","sourcePdf":"43jssc12-amazzanti-2004867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09754S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4684618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"328","xplore-issue":"4684618","articleId":"4684621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4684622,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Mirzaei","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4684618/4684622/4684622-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Mirzaei received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2006.","He is currently a Senior Staff Scientist with Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA.

The drawbacks of interleaving are addressed through architectural solutions. Channel redundancy counteracts the severe yield loss that parallel circuits experience due to local variation. Clock partitioning restricts the distribution of the precise, high-speed sampling clock to three centrally located sampling networks. Only a low frequency clock is distributed across the majority of die area. The skew-resistant global top-plate sampling network is extended to allow overlapped sampling windows without introducing extra sources of crosstalk. The 36 -way interleaved 5-bit ADC operates with a core voltage of 800 mV and consumes 1.20 mW total power at 250 MS/s. At Nyquist, the SNDR is 28.4 dB.

As CMOS continues to scale, we anticipate the LS N=4 VCO to generate signals beyond 2 Terahertz by using 22 nm CMOS and produce output power up to -1.5 dBm with 1.7% power added efficiency with an LS VCO + Class-B Power Amplifier cascaded circuit architecture.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2004868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4684618/04684629.pdf","startPage":"2730","endPage":"2738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2004868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terahertz CMOS Frequency Generator Using Linear Superposition Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Terahertz CMOS Frequency Generator Using Linear Superposition Technique","volume":"43","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416777","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684629/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684629/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terahertz CMOS Frequency Generator Using Linear Superposition Technique","sourcePdf":"43jssc12-dhuang-2004868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066583S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4684618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4684618","articleId":"4684629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684630,"authors":[{"name":"William W.

Only 5 years ago [3] an energy efficiency of 1 pJ/conversion step was considered state-of-the-art. Now power efficiencies are reported in f J/conversion step. In this paper two new converter techniques are presented that further improve upon reported energy efficiencies of A/D converters. The first technique implements the quantization with a comparator-based asynchronous binary search (CABS). The second technique implements the SAR control algorithm on the comparators (SAR-CC) that are also used to do the quantization. Both these techniques have been applied in a fully dynamic 7 bit A/D converter that uses a two-step lb coarse and 6b fine architecture [2]. The 1b coarse converter is implemented using the SAR-CC principle, the 6b fine converter is implemented using the CABS principle. The 7 bit prototype implementation in 90 nm digital CMOS on a 1 V supply achieves 6.4ENOB, 40 dB SNDR at 150 MS/s consuming 133 muW giving 10 fJ/conversion step energy efficiency (FOM). A second prototype implementing a stand-alone 6b CABS converter (the sub-A/D converter of the 7 bit converter) achieves 32 dB SNDR at 250 MS/s with 140 muW of power consumption, which results in a FOM of 15 fJ/conversion step.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4684618/04684631.pdf","startPage":"2631","endPage":"2640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 150 MS/s 133-W 7 bit ADC in 90 nm Digital CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A 150 MS/s 133<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$~\\mu$</tex></formula>W 7 bit ADC in 90 nm Digital CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684631/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10416778","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684631/","volume":"43","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 150 MS/s 133<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$~\\mu$</tex></formula>W 7 bit ADC in 90 nm Digital CMOS","sourcePdf":"43jssc12-gvanderplas-2006315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135421S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4684618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4684618","articleId":"4684631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4684633,"authors":[{"name":"Hidemi Noguchi","affiliation":["Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4684618/4684633/4684633-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hidemi Noguchi received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from the Science University of Tokyo in 1995 and 1997, respectively.","He joined NEC Corporation in 1997, where he was engaged in the development of optical modules and ICs for SONET/SDH application. from 2004 to 2006, he was with NEC Electronics Corporation, where he worked on the design of analog front-end ICs for Ethernet PHY.

An adaptive decision-point control (ADPC) scheme using the EOM feedback overcomes the time-varying waveform distortion due to transmission impairment, which causes severe degradation of bit-error-rate (BER) performance in high-speed (>40 Gb/s) data link systems. A 2.5 times 2.0-mm prototype chip is implemented in 0.18 -mum SiGe BiCMOS technology. The power consumption is 1.6 W with a +3.3-V supply voltage. Stable CDR operation with low-jitter performance (189 fs-rms) and the ADPC scheme using EOM feedback are demonstrated at 40 Gb/s. For a 30% duty-distorted 53 -mV signal, the proposed ADPC scheme drastically reduces the BER to le-12 compared to that (2e-7) without adaptive control. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CDR circuit greatly improves BER performance and provides robust CDR operation in high-speed data link systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 40-Gb/s CDR Circuit With Adaptive Decision-Point Control Based on Eye-Opening Monitor Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006227","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4684618/04684633.pdf","startPage":"2929","endPage":"2938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A 40-Gb/s CDR Circuit With Adaptive Decision-Point Control Based on Eye-Opening Monitor Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4684633/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416779","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40-Gb/s CDR Circuit With Adaptive Decision-Point Control Based on Eye-Opening Monitor Feedback","sourcePdf":"43jssc12-hnoguchi-2006227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069484S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4684618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4684618","articleId":"4684633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684634,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin J.

It uses a multipath indirect current-feedback topology. To achieve low offset, the amplifier employs a combination of chopping and auto-zeroing in a low frequency path to cancel the offset of a wide-band amplifier in a high frequency path. With a 60 kHz chopper clock and a 30 kHz auto-zero clock, this offset-stabilization scheme results in an offset voltage of less than 5 muV , a CMRR of 143 dB and a common-mode input voltage range from 1.9 to 30 V.

The multi-aperture architecture is also highly scalable, making it possible to increase pixel counts well beyond current levels. </para>","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4684618/04684639.pdf","startPage":"2990","endPage":"3005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Aperture Image Sensor With 0.7 - Pixels in 0.11 - CMOS Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684639/","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Aperture Image Sensor With 0.7 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox{m}}$</tex></formula> Pixels in 0.11 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox{m}}$</tex> </formula> CMOS Technology","volume":"43","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684639/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Aperture Image Sensor With 0.7 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox{m}}$</tex></formula> Pixels in 0.11 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox{m}}$</tex> </formula> CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"jssc-fife-2006457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053757S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4684618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4684618","articleId":"4684639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4684640,"authors":[{"name":"Kyehyung Lee","affiliation":["Conexant Systems, Inc., Newport Beach, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4684618/4684640/4684640-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyehyung Lee (S'02) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in physics from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1991 and 1993, respectively.

The presented ASIC includes eight readout front-end channels and an 11-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The key to its high performance and low-power dissipation is the new AC coupled chopper stabilized instrumentation amplifier (ACCIA) implementation that uses a coarse-fine servoloop and reaches more than 120 dB CMRR, consumes only 2.3 muA , and achieves a noise-efficiency factor (NEF) of 4.3. Furthermore, the ease of use of the ASIC is realized by incorporating Calibration and Electrode Impedance Measurement Modes to the ASIC. Therefore, the former can be used to check the functionality of the ASIC, as well as, to calibrate the gain matching of the channels, where as the latter can be used to track the quality of the biopotential electrode. The ASIC is implemented in 0.5 mum CMOS process and the total current consumption is 66 muA from 3 V.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4684618/04684648.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006462","startPage":"3025","endPage":"3038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 200 -W Eight-Channel EEG Acquisition ASIC for Ambulatory EEG Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684648/","displayDocTitle":"A 200 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>W Eight-Channel EEG Acquisition ASIC for Ambulatory EEG Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684648/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10416764","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 200 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>W Eight-Channel EEG Acquisition ASIC for Ambulatory EEG Systems","sourcePdf":"jssc-yazicioglu-2006462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067376S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4684618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"4684618","articleId":"4684648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4684649,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan C.

To realize a high bandwidth, the real part of the impedance of all RF nodes is kept low, and the voltage gain is not created at RF but in baseband where capacitive loading is no problem. Thus a high RF bandwidth is achieved without using inductors for bandwidth extension. By using an I/Q mixer with 25% duty-cycle LO waveform the output IF currents have also 25% duty-cycle, causing 2 times smaller DC-voltage drop after IF filtering. This allows for a 2 times increase in the impedance level of the IF filter, rendering more voltage gain for the same supply headroom. The implemented balun-LNA-I/Q-mixer topology achieves > 18 dB conversion gain, a flat noise figure < 5.5 dB from 500 MHz to 7 GHz, IIP2 = +20 dBm and IIP3 = -3 dBm.

In contrast to conventional DNA microarrays, in which each genetic sensor is designed to respond to a single target, in a CSM each sensor responds to a group of targets. We study the problem of designing CS probes that simultaneously account for both the constraints from group testing theory and the biochemistry of probe-target DNA hybridization. Our results show that, in order to achieve accurate hybridization profiling, consensus probe sequences are required to have sequence homology of at least 80% with all targets to be detected. Furthermore, experiments show that out-of-equilibrium datasets are usually as accurate as those obtained from equilibrium conditions. Consequently, one can use CSMs in applications for which only short hybridization times are allowed.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2008.56","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4684854/4684855/04684888.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2008.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probe Design for Compressive Sensing DNA Microarrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684888/","displayDocTitle":"Probe Design for Compressive Sensing DNA Microarrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397200","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684888/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probe Design for Compressive Sensing DNA Microarrays","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"3452a163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144921S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4684854","isNumber":"4684855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4684854","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4684855","articleId":"4684888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4684913,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37290487300"},{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37066282900"},{"name":"David Z.

In order to solve this problem, censor-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is presented to reduce communication overhead and total sensing time thus improve the agility of the cognitive radio networks, which indicates that the local sensing observation is censored and only local decision with reliable information is allowed to transmit to cognitive base-station. In order to prefix appropriate thresholds, a tradeoff between communication overhead and spectrum utilization is characterized to obtain the optimal no decision probability.

In this paper, we present a new approach that combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) techniques to transmit data through a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system within protected band which has been assigned for primary subscribers. This method allows the transmitter to transmit data in the protected band in a stealth fashion (as low as -120 dB to -300 dB) so that the primary subscribers will be unaware of the transmission. We show the opportunity of the secondary user to utilize the valuable spectrum of the protected band as well. The simulation shows that BER performance in the protected band is as good as in the unprotected band. We have also simulated the proposed scheme with the co-existence of WiMAX and MB-OFDM UWB devices as the primary user and the secondary user respectively.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4684996","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04684996.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4684996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO active interference cancellation for stealth cognitive radio in MB-OFDM UWB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4684996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4684996/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO active interference cancellation for stealth cognitive radio in MB-OFDM UWB","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397707","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4684996/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO active interference cancellation for stealth cognitive radio in MB-OFDM UWB","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051678S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4684996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685016,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenzhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37880415200"},{"name":"Weixia Zou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weixia","lastName":"Zou","id":"37302064900"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Honggang Zhang","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280788800"},{"name":"Yabin Ye","affiliation":["Create-Net, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yabin Ye","id":"37279356900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685016","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Detectors","Radio transmitters","Wireless communication","Interference","Matched filters","Computer vision","Frequency conversion","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","matched filters","probability","radio spectrum management","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radio","interference avoidance","fusion rule analysis","probability distribution","matched filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio (CR)","Spectrum Sensing","Local Decision Fusion","Energy Detector","Matched Filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685016","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685016","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is crucial for the success of cognitive radio because it will guarantee service improvement to unlicensed users and avoidance of interference to licensed users.

This paper analyses fusion rules of local decision and deduces their properties and conditions under the assumption that all the decisions are independent and follow the same probability distributions.

A CR user has the ability to change its transmit parameters rapidly according to the environment it senses. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is a good candidate for CR systems due to its flexibility in allocating resources among secondary users. In this paper, the design of a fast and efficient method for dynamically allocating subcarriers, transmit powers and bits to secondary users in a multiuser (MU) OFDM-based CR system is considered. A memetic algorithm (MA) combined with multi-local-search methods (MLS-MA) is proposed and shown to provide an improved performance over previously reported algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685018","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685018.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memetic algorithms with multi-local-search for resource allocation in multiuser OFDM based Cognitive Radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685018/","displayDocTitle":"Memetic algorithms with multi-local-search for resource allocation in multiuser OFDM based Cognitive Radio systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397725","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685018/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memetic algorithms with multi-local-search for resource allocation in multiuser OFDM based Cognitive Radio systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046934S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4685036,"authors":[{"name":"Guangwen Li","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Guangwen","lastName":"Li","id":"37292283700"},{"name":"Xuelan Zou","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Xuelan Zou","id":"37287923900"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Xin Wang","id":"37881411300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685036","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"For high rate LDPC codes with light column weight and few redundant checks in their parity check matrix, the belief propagation (BP) decodings yield good error performance at the cost of high complexity. Aiming at seeking a effective decoder with good performance versus complexity tradeoff for this kind of LDPC codes, we present a new decoding framework which cascades a bit flipping (BF) variant with the ordered statistic decoding (OSD). During the iterative decoding of BF variant, the flipping value for each codeword bit is summed. The summation for each bit will be utilized as the reliability input for the OSD postprocessing, if no valid codeword is found after the maximum number of iterations for the BF variant is reached. With respect to the BP, simulation results show that the proposed BF-OSD achieves comparable performance with much less complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685036.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid decoding for one class of low-density parity-check codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","AWGN","Belief propagation","Data mining","Binary phase shift keying","Modulation coding","Additive white noise","Memoryless systems","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","iterative decoding","parity check codes","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check codes","LDPC codes","parity check matrix","belief propagation decoding","bit flipping variant","ordered statistic decoding","iterative decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid decoding for one class of low-density parity-check codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685036/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397739","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid decoding for one class of low-density parity-check codes","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052777S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685037,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuni Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Xiuni Wang","id":"37087182138"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Ma","id":"37087303610"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685037","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Iterative decoding","Gaussian approximation","Parity check codes","Power engineering and energy","Sun","Detection algorithms","AWGN","Bit error rate","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","encoding","Gaussian noise","iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EXIT-chart-based power allocations","extrinsic information transfer","superposition multilevel coding systems","sigma-mapping","iterative decoding-detection algorithms","convergence threshold","Gaussian noise","Gaussian approximation power allocation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multilevel coding","superposition","EXIT","power allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685037","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685037.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EXIT-chart-based power allocations for superposition multilevel coding systems","abstract":"Multilevel coding with sigma-mapping is one simple way to obtain coding gain as well as shaping gain, while power-allocation, by allocating proper powers to different levels, can facilitate the iterative decoding/detection algorithms.

Especially for correlated channel, a significant savings in complexity is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685055","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685055.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stack algorithm based on lattice-reduction for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685055/","displayDocTitle":"Stack algorithm based on lattice-reduction for MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397753","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685055/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stack algorithm based on lattice-reduction for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064079S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685056,"authors":[{"name":"FengGang Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications, South-East University, Nanjing, China","School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"FengGang Sun","id":"37879170400"},{"name":"Ju Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Ju Liu","id":"37279467700"},{"name":"HongJi Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"HongJi Xu","id":"37277776100"},{"name":"Peng Lan","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Peng Lan","id":"37286274400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685056","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"abstract":"In this paper, a receive antenna selection algorithm based on the theory of convex optimization is proposed to improve the system performance over Rayleigh fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.

Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss of monitoring detail.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Statistics","Monitoring","Internet","Communication system traffic control","Statistical analysis","Educational institutions","Performance loss","Memory management","Passive networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","packet radio networks","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet rates","traffic","router links","netflow"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685060","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685060.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting the issues on netflow sample and export performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting the issues on netflow sample and export performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685060/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685060/","accessionNumber":"10397757","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting the issues on netflow sample and export performance","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063502S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4685066,"authors":[{"name":"Yiwei Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Yiwei Yu","id":"37879582300"},{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Xiaojing Huang","id":"37293558100"},{"name":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","id":"38299196300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685066","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"abstract":"This paper proposes a block spread orthogonal frequency division multiple access (BS-OFDMA) system with a combined space-time coded multiple-input multiple-out (STC-MIMO) scheme called STC-MIMO BS-OFDMA for transmission over frequency selective fading channels.

However, the complexity of maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) grows exponentially in the number of parallel streams. This detection algorithm is prohibitive when the number of parallel streams is large. The interference cancellation based sequence detection (ICSD) is proposed in this paper to reduce the detection complexity without performance loss. The heart of this method is to combine the interference cancellation and the MLSE into one iteration. The complexity of ICSD grows linearly in the number of parallel streams. The simulation results have shown that the proposed method can efficiently approximate the optimum MAP performance at a moderate signal to noise ratio (SNR) in coded OFDM-CMM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685080.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near optimum Sequence Detection for coded OFDM-CMM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM","Interference cancellation","Signal to noise ratio","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Frequency division multiplexing","Maximum likelihood detection","Detection algorithms","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","diversity reception","interference suppression","iterative methods","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","modulation coding","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","convolutional multicode multiplexing system","coded OFDM-CMM system","diversity gain","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","MLSE","interference cancellation based sequence detection","iteration method","optimum MAP performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Near optimum Sequence Detection for coded OFDM-CMM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685080/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397772","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near optimum Sequence Detection for coded OFDM-CMM systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051256S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4685081,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Peng Sun","id":"37873250300"},{"name":"Xing Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37289760700"},{"name":"Daoben Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Daoben","lastName":"Li","id":"37277108000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685081","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"A lattice reduction aided MMSE detection combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme is proposed in this paper to suppress the noise amplification in the commonly used MMSE detection of non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NFDM) signals.

Another advantage of the new scheme is that lattice reduction adds very little complexity to on line decoding of NFDM signals in AWGN channels because the reduction part of it could be done beforehand. Simulations show that complexity of the new scheme is much lower than the recently proposed decoding algorithm of randomized rounding semidefinite relaxation (SDR) in NFDM system, while more competitively, the BER performance of the new decoding scheme outruns direct randomized rounding SDR in high signal to noise ratio (SNR) when the frequency span is small or the number of sub-carriers is large.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685081.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice reduction aided MMSE-SIC detection for non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Frequency division multiplexing","Bit error rate","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Interference cancellation","Silicon carbide","Noise reduction","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","error statistics","frequency division multiplexing","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lattice reduction aided MMSE-SIC detection","non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","successive interference cancellation scheme","noise amplification","Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz algorithm","modulation matrix","bit error rate performance","BER performance","AWGN channels","decoding algorithm","randomized rounding semidefinite relaxation","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Lattice reduction aided MMSE-SIC detection for non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685081/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397773","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice reduction aided MMSE-SIC detection for non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119878S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685082,"authors":[{"name":"Siyang Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Siyang Liu","id":"37310596000"},{"name":"Feifei Wang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Feifei Wang","id":"37654469400"},{"name":"Junyang Shen","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Junyang Shen","id":"37310161900"},{"name":"Yuanan Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yuanan Liu","id":"37279411900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685082","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"abstract":"A novel model assisted channel estimation scheme is proposed to estimate the time-varying MIMO channel.

Node localization has been a topic of active research in recent years. Accurate self-localization capability is highly desirable in wireless sensor network (WSN). This paper proposes a new centralized localization algorithm for WSN. Given the distances between a sensor and its a few 1-hop neighbors, the proposed algorithm can estimate the sensorpsilas position with genetic algorithm(GA). The sensor doesnpsilat have to neighbor to anchors. The localization accuracy is very high. Four example problems are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve higher accurate position estimation than semi-definite programming with gradient search localization (SDPL) [11] and simulated annealing based localization (SAL)[13].","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685104","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685104.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"629","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new centralized localization algorithm for wireless sensor network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new centralized localization algorithm for wireless sensor network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10397791","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4685104/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new centralized localization algorithm for wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051778S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4685109,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Wan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Ping Wan","id":"37088109713"},{"name":"Michael McGuire","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"McGuire","id":"37433706100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685109","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685109","abstract":"Accurate radio channel estimation is necessary for efficient wireless communications. This paper proposes a novel Kalman filter algorithm using basis expansion models (BEMs) of the channel gains to accurately estimate fast fading channels. The channel state for finite duration blocks is summarized in terms of BEM coefficients. The dependency between channel blocks is described with a second-order autoregressive model for the time evolution of the BEM coefficients. A Kalman smoother, based on the dynamic model, is used to combine information from measurements made in different blocks. The mean square error (MSE) of the Kalman smoother is near that of the optimal Wiener filter. The computational cost of this new algorithm is on the same order as existing channel estimation algorithms. This paper is robust to variations of the radio channel parameters from the design values.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","startPage":"647","endPage":"651","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685109.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation in fast fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Kalman filters","Wiener filter","Wireless communication","Mean square error methods","Computational efficiency","Robustness","State estimation","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","Kalman filters","mean square error methods","radiocommunication","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast fading channels","radio channel estimation","wireless communications","Kalman filter algorithm","basis expansion models","channel state","finite duration blocks","channel blocks","second-order autoregressive model","mean square error","optimal Wiener filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation in fast fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685109/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685109/","accessionNumber":"10397795","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation in fast fading channels","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059601S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4685111,"authors":[{"name":"Yih-Min Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yih-Min Chen","id":"38185516900"},{"name":"Quei-Ping Liao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Quei-Ping Liao","id":"37882633100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685111","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"abstract":"PN-sequence padding scheme has been proposed in TDS-OFDM systems instead of the cyclic prefix scheme in the traditional CP-OFDM systems. The PN-sequence, padded between normal OFDM symbols, has dual functions for assisting in channel estimation and preventing inter-symbol-interference between normal OFDM symbols over frequency-selective fading channel. However there are ISI to the normal OFDM symbols caused by the padding PN-sequence, referred to as PN-ISI. Therefore it is crucial to remove the PN-ISI in TDS-OFDM systems.

frequency division multiplexing cellular systems, the co-channel interference (CCI) from adjacent cells becomes the dominant interference. Considering the CCI in multiple cells, the optimal solution for data rate maximization is derived from the dual decomposition method. Based on the optimal solution, a simplified uplink distributed power allocation (UDPA) algorithm is proposed. In this simplified algorithm, the Lagrangian multiplier is determined off-line and the power allocation iterative function is updated in every transmit time interval (TTI). The UDPA only needs the traffic loading information in adjacent cells and the local information of each user, and performs power allocation in a distributed way, which is easily realized and reduces overhead cost. In the simulation, the parameter and convergence of the UDPA algorithm is analyzed and the performance is compared with optimal power allocation and equal power allocation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm exploits the spectral diversity gain on the co-channel in adjacent cells, so the system throughput is improved.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685124","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685124.pdf","startPage":"716","endPage":"720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink power allocation for interference coordination in multi-cell OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685124/","displayDocTitle":"Uplink power allocation for interference coordination in multi-cell OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397807","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685124/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink power allocation for interference coordination in multi-cell OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048955S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4685135,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Ren","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Zhiyuan Ren","id":"37087284230"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Tiejun Lv","id":"37087179297"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685135","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685135","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Ultra wideband communication","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Noise reduction","Ultra wideband technology","Wireless communication","Fast Fourier transforms","Deconvolution","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","discrete Fourier transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity blind channel estimation algorithm","UWB wireless communication systems","dense multipath environments","channel impulse response","fast Fourier transform","discrete wavelet transform","discrete Fourier transform","noise suppression","computational complexities","propagation paths","frequency-selective fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","Blind Channel Estimation","Discrete Wavelet Transform","Pulse Position Modulation"]}],"abstract":"A low-complexity blind channel estimation algorithm is proposed for ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communication systems in dense multipath environments. To accurately estimate channel impulse response (CIR), the proposed algorithm exploits an unconventional denoising fast Fourier transform (FFT) to perform deconvolution. The denoising FFT employs the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute discrete Fourier transform (DFT), meanwhile suppressing the noise. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both show that the proposed approach greatly improves the estimation accuracy of CIR, compared with the FFT-based algorithm. However, their computational complexities are on the same order. In particular, the proposed method can be used for identification of more realistic channel models, in which signal echoes along different propagation paths undergo different frequency-selective fading.","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685135.pdf","startPage":"762","endPage":"766","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity blind channel estimation algorithm for UWB communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity blind channel estimation algorithm for UWB communication systems","htmlLink":"/document/4685135/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10397816","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity blind channel estimation algorithm for UWB communication systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052899S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4685149,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Chen","affiliation":["Llnstitute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qing Chen","id":"37876754400"},{"name":"Wei Zheng","affiliation":["Llnstitute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Wei Zheng","id":"37690459800"},{"name":"Jian Fang","affiliation":["Zhejiang University City College, ZUCC, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jian Fang","id":"37873999000"},{"name":"Kai Luo","affiliation":["Llnstitute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Kai Luo","id":"38231049100"},{"name":"Bing Shi","affiliation":["Llnstitute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Bing Shi","id":"37876652800"},{"name":"Ming Zhang","affiliation":["Llnstitute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Ming Zhang","id":"37539174200"},{"name":"Xianmin Zhang","affiliation":["Llnstitute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xianmin Zhang","id":"38560178700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685149","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"abstract":"To improve the performance of in-loop deblocking filter in H.264/AVC, this paper proposes a pipelined hardware architecture. A novel transposer design is presented and its hardware cost is reduced by 15% with forwarding logic to shift pixels. Through adopting a filtering order with vertical and horizontal edges processed alternately, on-chip memory is greatly saved and only two 32x32 bits SRAMs are employed as a buffer. The time to prepare and transfer the intermediate data is also reduced, and only 222 clock cycles are required to filter one macroblock. By processing strong and normal mode filtering simultaneously in a 5-stage pipeline, the proposed architecture can work at a maximum clock frequency of 200 MHz under 0.18 \u03bcm technology, and meet the real-time filtering requirement of high-definition (1920x1088) video at a frame rate up to 116 frames per second. Moreover, for applications with low power requirement, it only needs a working frequency of 55 MHz to realize real-time decoding of 1920x1088@30fps video.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685149.pdf","startPage":"815","endPage":"819","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pipelined hardware architecture of deblocking filter in H.264/AVC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Filters","Automatic voltage control","Filtering","Clocks","Frequency","Costs","Logic design","Pipelines","High definition video"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","decoding","filtering theory","pipeline processing","SRAM chips","telecommunication standards","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined hardware architecture","deblocking filter","transposer design","video decoding","H.264/AVC","SRAM","frequency 200 MHz","frequency 55 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264","deblocking filter","filtering order","pipeline"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A pipelined hardware architecture of deblocking filter in H.264/AVC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685149/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397826","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pipelined hardware architecture of deblocking filter in H.264/AVC","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055869S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4685159,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293558100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685159","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"abstract":"Contrary to the common belief that the carrier frequency offset (CFO) in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system would adversely impact on system performance, this paper shows that the CFO actually has the effect of linear precoding among transmitted data symbols and hence can be exploited to improve the diversity performance over frequency-selective fading channels.

However, the impulse interference is not negligible in many communication channels, such as power line channels, where the impulse interference greatly deteriorates the performance of MPA based on Gauss optimization. It is necessary to restudy the decoding for LDPC codes in impulse environment. We introduce symmetric alpha-stable (SalphaS) noise into a statistical model of impulse noise environment, and consider that interference in the receiver is a mixture of AWGN and SalphaS noise. Based on this noise model, we analyze the probability density function (PDF) of the mixed noise through the numerical calculation method, and propose a robust MPA (RMPA) to account for the impulse environment. The simulations show that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed RMPA is robust.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685174","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685174.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","startPage":"922","endPage":"925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check codes in impulse noise environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check codes in impulse noise environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685174/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397846","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4685174/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check codes in impulse noise environment","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049736S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4685176,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research and Development Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Zhong","id":"37873976500"},{"name":"Yunzhou Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yunzhou Li","id":"37292404300"},{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiang Chen","id":"37278218100"},{"name":"Hanying Hu","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research and Development Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hanying Hu","id":"37069184800"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jing Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685176","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":316},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685176","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Iterative decoding","AWGN","Laboratories","Microwave technology","Belief propagation","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["min-sum decoding algorithm","LDPC codes","classified correction","low density parity check codes","normalized belief propagation-based algorithms","offset BP-based algorithms","check node degree","FPGA implementation","field programmable gate arrays","bit rate 200 Mbit/s"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a modified min-sum decoding algorithm based on classified correction is proposed for low density parity check (LDPC) codes.

The proposed receiver can achieve bit-error-rate (BER) performance close to that of optimal APP algorithm with significantly lower complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685190.pdf","startPage":"987","endPage":"991","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo multiuser detection for STBC MC-CDMA uplink systems using hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Particle swarm optimization","Detectors","Frequency conversion","MIMO","Fading","Computational complexity","Hopfield neural networks","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","code division multiple access","computational complexity","error statistics","fading channels","Hopfield neural nets","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","particle swarm optimisation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STBC MC-CDMA uplink systems","hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","space-time block-codes","multicarrier code division multiple access","frequency selective multi-input multi-output fading channels","MIMO","soft-in soft-out multiuser detector","SISO","a posteriori probability algorithm","computational complexity","Hopfield neural network","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Turbo multiuser detection for STBC MC-CDMA uplink systems using hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685190/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397859","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo multiuser detection for STBC MC-CDMA uplink systems using hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069394S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685191,"authors":[{"name":"Kejing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"lastName":"Kejing Zhang","id":"37654149800"},{"name":"Laurie Cuthbert","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Cuthbert","id":"37279686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685191","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Multiaccess communication","Communication system traffic control","Maximum likelihood estimation","Legged locomotion","Antenna radiation patterns","Pattern matching","Resource management","Radio control","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","maximum likelihood estimation","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic congestion forecasting","WCDMA networks","congestion control","radio resource management","early detection","rapid resolution network congestion","3G networks","maximum likelihood estimation","wideband code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic prediction","maximum likelihood estimation","radio resource management","congestion control"]}],"abstract":"Congestion control is considered as a key factor in radio resource management.

We propose a new MMSE channel shortening equalization algorithm applicable to all the OFDM/OFDMA systems with equal or unequal subcarrier powers.

We start with a theoretical description of the relevant mechanisms and parameters describing dual-polarized propagation. We then provide an overview o the most recent experimental results related to dual-polarized channels. It is namely observed that even the first-order statistics of the uplink channel matrix might not be equal to those of the downlink channel. In particular, the XPD might be different on the up- and downlinks and depend on the considered transmitted polarization. Finally, we propose an innovative and realistic model of dual-polarized channels accounting for these observations. The main advantage of the model is its simple analytical formulation, implying that it can easily be used as an abstract formalism to design adequate space-time coding or precoding techniques.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685211","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660003/4684945/04685211.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive model of dual-polarized channels: From experimental observations to an analytical formulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685211/","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive model of dual-polarized channels: From experimental observations to an analytical formulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397875","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685211/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive model of dual-polarized channels: From experimental observations to an analytical formulation","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4685211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146844S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4685212,"authors":[{"name":"Ranran Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ranran Zhang","id":"37069919600"},{"name":"Aimin Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Aimin Yang","id":"37874563100"},{"name":"Siyang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Siyang Liu","id":"37310596000"},{"name":"Gang Xie","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Gang Xie","id":"37305624300"},{"name":"Yuanan Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yuanan Liu","id":"37279411900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2373-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685212","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","MIMO","Bit error rate","Channel state information","Wireless communication","Radio transmitters","Fading","Algorithm design and analysis","Delay effects","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","error statistics","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive modulation","MIMO systems","bit error rate","BER requirement","multiple-input multiple-output systems","imperfect channel state information","Lagrange method","spectral efficiency","perfect CSI assumption"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates adaptive modulation (AM) algorithm to maximize transmission rate under bit error rate (BER) and transmit power constraints for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with imperfect channel state information (CSI).

To guarantee the superiority of the proposed adaptive Turbo receiver in terms of decreasing processing delay and power consuming, an MMSE based no-ordered parallel soft interference cancellation (NOPSIC) MIMO detector which takes error propagation into account is explored for the non-first iteration.

Unfortunately, the channel estimation errors have not been taken into account by existing soft-output MIMO minimum mean square error (MMSE) ordering successive interference cancellation (OSIC) detectors when calculating the log-likelihood ratio of each coded bit, i.e., the soft information. As a result, the system performance can be degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel soft-output MIMO MMSE OSIC detector when MMSE MIMO channel estimation is applied.

To guarantee the interference to PUs under a predefined threshold, admission control has to be investigated. In addition, different SUs may require different levels of quality of service (QoS), and pay differently based on their services. The network operator cannot provide complete fairness between different SUs. The problem of our interest is to maximize the total revenue output subjected to the interference constraint on the PU, and QoS (in terms of packet error rate (PER)) requirements on both SUs and the PU. In this paper, we transform the admission control problem into a 0-1 knapsack problem, and propose two schemes: AC-Greedy and AC-Dynamic. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685241/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10397899","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685241/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Revenue-based admission control for cognitive radio cellular systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revenue-based admission control for cognitive radio cellular systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062469S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4685243,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Deng","affiliation":["Communication Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"lastName":"Yu Deng","id":"37538736200"},{"name":"Alister G.

An experiment on a reconfigurable platform shows that the algorithm is not only computationally efficient but can also easy to be reconfigured easily and fast.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685248/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10397904","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685248/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient multi-resolution spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient multi-resolution spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050179S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660003","isNumber":"4684945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660003","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4684945","articleId":"4685248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4685342,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper proposes a novel multilevel PWM strategy to have the advantages of low frequency switching and reduced total harmonic distortion (THD). The basic idea of the proposed area integration PWM (AIPWM) method is that the area of the required sinusoidal (fundamental) output and total area of all the pulses in every half cycle are same. The rationale for opting AIPWM is easy implementation of the control scheme in real-time digital platform. An additional crux objective of this paper is evolutionary computing based placement of the AIPWM pulses. The same is fulfilled by two soft computing techniques namely Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). A prototype seven-level cascaded inverter has been built and controlled with the novel PWM strategies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685342/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10398107","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685342/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary computing based area integration PWM technique for multilevel inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary computing based area integration PWM technique for multilevel inverters","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-11182008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042222S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4670336","isNumber":"4685322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670336","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4685322","articleId":"4685342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Numeric Power Systems Ltd","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685353,"authors":[{"name":"Parag Anand Rajne","affiliation":["Power Electronics Group, Indian institute of science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Parag Anand","lastName":"Rajne","id":"37871454800"},{"name":"V.

A multilayer feedforward neural network with backpropagation is used. The ANN receives amplitude and angle of the reference vector to calculate the duty cycles of various space vectors in different sectors which can be used for the generation of PWM pulses for the control of converter. The ANN significantly reduces the computational efforts of the modulation technique and makes the implementation of space vector modulation algorithm very fast without losing precision compared to the conventional SVM algorithm implementation using look up table. The performance of the converter in terms of its power quality on the input and output side is investigated through computer simulations and the results have been found excellent. A mathematical model of the rectifier is also developed.

One critical aspect of power quality studies is the ability to perform automatic power quality data analysis and categorization. This paper presents an approach that is able to provide the detection and time location as well as the identification of power quality problems. The method is developed by using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) analysis. The given signal is decomposed through wavelet transform. Later, using the wavelet coefficients, feature extraction is done and an artificial neural network is developed to classify the power quality disturbances. The training and testing data required to develop the ANN model is generated through simulation. In this paper, it is demonstrated that each power quality disturbance has unique deviations from the pure sinusoidal waveform and this is adopted to provide a reliable classification of the type of disturbance.","doi":"10.1109/IICPE.2006.4685411","publicationTitle":"2006 India International Conference on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 India International Conference on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670336/4685322/04685411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICPE.2006.4685411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685322","startPage":"425","endPage":"430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Quality monitoring using wavelet transform and Artificial Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Quality monitoring using wavelet transform and Artificial Neural Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685411/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"10398176","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4685411/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Quality monitoring using wavelet transform and Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-11182008-00089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111697S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4670336","isNumber":"4685322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670336","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4685322","articleId":"4685411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Numeric Power Systems Ltd","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685415,"authors":[{"name":"Bob Schell","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4685413/4685415/4685415-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bob Schell received the B.S.E. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","From 2001 to 2004 he worked at MultiLink Technology, later Vitesse Semiconductor, in the applications division supporting optical drivers and serial links.

The data retention voltage (DRV) defines the minimum \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VDD</i>\n that can be applied to an SRAM cell without losing data. The conventional worst-case guard-banding approach selects a fixed standby supply voltage at design time to accommodate the variability of DRV, which sacrifices potential power savings for non-worst-case scenarios. We have proposed a canary-based feedback to achieve aggressive power savings by tracking PVT variations through canary cell failures. In this paper, we show new measured silicon results that confirm the ability of the canary scheme to track PVT changes. We thoroughly analyze the adaptiveness of the canary cells for tracking changes in the SRAM array, including the ability to track PVT fluctuations. We present circuits for robustly building the control logic that implements the feedback mechanism at subthreshold supply voltages, and we derive a new analytical model to help tune the canary cells in the presence of variations. To realistically quantify the potential savings achievable by the canary scheme, we assess the impact of various sources of overhead. Finally, we investigate the performance of the canary based scheme in nanometer technologies, and we show that it promises to provide substantial standby power savings down to the 22 nm node.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2005814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4685413/04685425.pdf","startPage":"2514","endPage":"2523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2005814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques to Extend Canary-Based Standby - Scaling for SRAMs to 45 nm and Beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685425/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Techniques to Extend Canary-Based Standby <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$V_{DD}$</tex></formula> Scaling for SRAMs to 45 nm and Beyond","volume":"43","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324300","htmlLink":"/document/4685425/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques to Extend Canary-Based Standby <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$V_{DD}$</tex></formula> Scaling for SRAMs to 45 nm and Beyond","sourcePdf":"43jssc11-jwang-2005814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064239S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4685413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4685413","articleId":"4685425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4685428,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

Four power-rail ESD clamp circuits with different ESD-transient detection circuits were fabricated in a 0.18-mum CMOS process and tested to compare their system-level ESD susceptibility, which are named as power-rail ESD clamp circuits with typical \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RC</i>\n-based detection, PMOS feedback, NMOS+PMOS feedback, and cascaded PMOS feedback in this work. During the system-level ESD test, where the ICs in a system have been powered up, the feedback loop used in the power-rail ESD clamp circuits provides the lock function to keep the ESD-clamping NMOS in a ldquolatch-onrdquo state. The latch-on ESD-clamping NMOS, which is often drawn with a larger device dimension to sustain high ESD level, conducts a huge current between the power lines to perform a latchup-like failure after the system-level ESD test. A modified power-rail ESD clamp circuit is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed power-rail ESD clamp circuit can provide high enough chip-level ESD robustness, and without suffering the latchup-like failure during the system-level ESD test.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2005451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2005451","startPage":"2533","endPage":"2545","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4685413/04685429.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation and Design of On-Chip Power-Rail ESD Clamp Circuits Without Suffering Latchup-Like Failure During System-Level ESD Test","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Investigation and Design of On-Chip Power-Rail ESD Clamp Circuits Without Suffering Latchup-Like Failure During System-Level ESD Test","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","volume":"43","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685429/","accessionNumber":"10324302","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685429/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation and Design of On-Chip Power-Rail ESD Clamp Circuits Without Suffering Latchup-Like Failure During System-Level ESD Test","sourcePdf":"43jssc11-mker-2005451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074837S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4685413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4685413","articleId":"4685429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4685434,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-Jin Kim","affiliation":["Multimedia Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4685413/4685434/4685434-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seong-Jin Kim (S'04\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2001.

A parallel-path equalizing filter is used to compensate the high-frequency loss in copper cables. The adaptation is performed by only varying the gain in the high-pass path, which allows a single loop for proper control and completely removes the RC filters used for separately extracting the high- and low-frequency contents of the signal. A full-rate bang-bang phase detector with only five latches is proposed in the following CDR circuit. Minimizing the number of latches saves the power consumption and the area occupied by inductors. The performance is also improved by avoiding complicated routing of high-frequency signals. The receiver is able to recover 40 Gb/s data passing through a 4 m cable with 10 dB loss at 20 GHz.

Our aim in this paper is to compare several commonly-used sparsity measures according to intuitive attributes that a sparsity measure should have. Sparsity of representations of signals in fields such as blind source separation, compression, sampling and signal analysis has proved not just to be useful but a key factor in the success of algorithms in these areas. Intuitively, a sparse representation is one in which a small number of coefficients contain a large proportion of the energy. In this paper we discuss six properties (robin hood, scaling, rising tide, cloning, bill gates and babies) that we believe a sparsity measure should have. The main contribution of this paper is a table which classifies commonly-used sparsity measures based on whether or not they satisfy these six propositions. Only one of these measures satisfies all six: the Gini index.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685455","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670334/4685440/04685455.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685455","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing measures of sparsity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparing measures of sparsity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685455/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685455/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398020","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing measures of sparsity","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1176S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670334","isNumber":"4685440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670334","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4685440","articleId":"4685455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4685456,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Huy Phan","affiliation":["RIKEN Brain Science Institute, LaboratoriesP, Wako, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Anh Huy","lastName":"Phan","id":"37410418500"},{"name":"Andrzej Cichocki","affiliation":["Systems Research Institute Polish Academy of Science, Department EE, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Cichocki","id":"37266683500"},{"name":"Kim Sach Nguyen","affiliation":["Vietnam"],"firstName":"Kim Sach","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38183395100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2375-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2376-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"4685456","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Iterative algorithms","Signal processing","Cost function","Sparse matrices","Image coding","Iterative methods","Inverse problems","Source separation","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","data compression","encoding","iterative methods","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed compressed sensing","iterative thresholding algorithm","local cost functions","HALS-CS algorithm","source reconstruction","signal compression","adaptive nonlinearly","ill-conditioned problems","ill-posed problems","nonzero coefficients"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a new iterative thresholding algorithm for distributed compressed sensing (CS) based on a set of local cost functions referred as HALS-CS algorithm (compare with).

For these purposes, we have performed simultaneous constrained minimization of a set of robust cost functions called alpha and beta divergences. Our algorithms are locally stable and work well for the NMF blind source separation (BSS) not only for the over-determined case but also for an under-determined (over-complete) case (i.e., for a system which has less sensors than sources) if data are sufficiently sparse. The NMF learning rules are extended and generalized for N-th order nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF).

The key idea of KPNLMS is (a) sparse representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver based on a certain Krylov subspace, (b) use of the dasiasparsitypsila for fast convergence, and (c) simplification to keep linear complexity per iteration. To clarify the convergence properties of the proposed receiver, its derivation from the variable-metric version of the adaptive projected subgradient method (V-APSM) is presented. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670334/4685440/04685474.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS/CDMA linear receiver based on Krylov-proportionate adaptive filtering technique\u2014an extension to complex-valued signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Adaptive filters","Convergence","Wireless communication","Frequency","Computational complexity","Multiple access interference","Mean square error methods","Filtering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","code division multiple access","least mean squares methods","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA linear receiver","Krylov-proportionate adaptive filtering technique","complex-valued signals","training-based adaptive linear receiver","multiple access interference","least-mean-square algorithm","minimum mean square error receiver","adaptive projected subgradient method","variable-metric version","wireless communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive filter","CDMA","linear receiver","Krylov subspace"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"DS/CDMA linear receiver based on Krylov-proportionate adaptive filtering technique\u2014an extension to complex-valued signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685474/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398039","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS/CDMA linear receiver based on Krylov-proportionate adaptive filtering technique\u2014an extension to complex-valued signals","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06373S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670334","isNumber":"4685440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670334","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4685440","articleId":"4685474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4685476,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, due principally to both of the limited size and of the microelectronics technology of the used hardware devices, many practical problem can be encountered to reach the real time processing since the application of the ICA algorithm requires the consumption of a huge number of input signal samples. Hence, the system performance was degraded since we required the consumption of an important number of memory circuits with faster hardware execution time. Therefore, in order to improve the hardware performances of the device, in this paper, the authors proposed the sequential processing of one neuron hardware model based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Such approach overcomes the interconnections complexities of the FPGA architecture. Thus, an optimal digital circuit design can be proposed to avoid the consumption of much hardware resources in which a maximum number of samples can be handled while maintaining high speed of hardware processing time. The proposed approach was demonstrated through the experimental study of TIMIT data base exhibiting a hardware execution time of 3.3 mus to process 10000 samples with 57 KHz of sample rates to separate two output independent signals from two input mixed signals.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685476","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670334/4685440/04685476.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Digital circuit design of ICA based implementation of FPGA for real time Blind Signal Separation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398041","htmlLink":"/document/4685476/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital circuit design of ICA based implementation of FPGA for real time Blind Signal Separation","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05241S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670334","isNumber":"4685440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670334","xplore-issue":"4685440","articleId":"4685476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685477,"authors":[{"name":"Rajagopal G.

Misuse detection systems use signature databases to detect known attacks. However, it is difficult to keep the database up to date with the rate of discovery of vulnerabilities. They also cannot detect zero-day attacks. By contrast, anomaly detection systems learn the normal behavior of the system and monitor its activity to detect any deviations from the normal. Any such deviations are flagged as anomalous. This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications. The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles. It then uses these profiles to detect anomalies in the HTTP requests. Customized profiles help reduce the number of false positives. Automatic learning ensures that the system can be used with different kinds of web application environments, without the necessity for manual configuration.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685477","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670334/4685440/04685477.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685440","startPage":"187","endPage":"192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data processing and anomaly detection in web-based applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data processing and anomaly detection in web-based applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685477/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398042","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4685477/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data processing and anomaly detection in web-based applications","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059708S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670334","isNumber":"4685440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670334","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4685440","articleId":"4685477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4685482,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Pavelka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Pavelka","id":"37085394882"},{"name":"Pavel Kral","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Kral","id":"37596054300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2375-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2376-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"4685482","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685482","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Decision trees","Hidden Markov models","Automatic speech recognition","Scheduling","Testing","Training data","Computer science","Acoustical engineering","Acoustic emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","decision trees","hidden Markov models","multilayer perceptrons","probability","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network acoustic model","decision tree clustered triphones","Gaussian mixture acoustic model","multilayer perceptron","emission probability estimator","hidden Markov model","automatic speech recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685482","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670334/4685440/04685482.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","startPage":"216","endPage":"220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network acoustic model with decision tree clustered triphones","abstract":"This article tries to compare the performance of neural network and Gaussian mixture acoustic models (GMMs).

Seizure prediction is a major field of neurological research, enabled by statistical analysis methods applied to features derived from intracranial Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity. However, no reliable seizure prediction method is ready for clinical applications. In this study, we use modern machine learning techniques to predict seizures from a number of features proposed in the literature. We concentrate on aggregated features that encode the relationship between pairs of EEG channels, such as cross-correlation, nonlinear interdependence, difference of Lyapunov exponents and wavelet analysis-based synchrony such as phase locking. We compare L1-regularized logistic regression, convolutional networks, and support vector machines. Results are reported on the standard Freiburg EEG dataset which contains data from 21 patients suffering from medically intractable focal epilepsy. For each patient, at least one method predicts 100% of the seizures on average 60 minutes before the onset, with no false alarm. Possible future applications include implantable devices capable of warning the patient of an upcoming seizure as well as implanted drug-delivery devices.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685487","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670334/4685440/04685487.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685440","startPage":"244","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing SVM and convolutional networks for epileptic seizure prediction from intracranial EEG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparing SVM and convolutional networks for epileptic seizure prediction from intracranial EEG","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685487/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398052","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4685487/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing SVM and convolutional networks for epileptic seizure prediction from intracranial EEG","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068381S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670334","isNumber":"4685440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670334","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4685440","articleId":"4685487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4685496,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Bouguila","affiliation":["Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Bouguila","id":"37271096900"},{"name":"Djemel Ziou","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Informatique, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Canada"],"firstName":"Djemel","lastName":"Ziou","id":"37271098600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2375-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2376-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"4685496","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":431},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Bayesian methods","Information systems","Systems engineering and theory","Sampling methods","Density functional theory","Councils","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","estimation theory","pattern classification","pattern clustering","sampling methods","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dirichlet distributions","learning approach","nonparametric Bayesian framework","nonGaussian data clustering","posterior distribution estimation","Gibbs sampler","data classification","image models prediction"]}],"abstract":"A significant problem in clustering is the determination of the number of classes which best describes the data.

These three complex-valued vectors have such similarities: 1) despite of resulting from the Fourier transformation, they are not indexed by the frequency bins; 2) its real part and image part are proved to be correlated. Hence, such a complex-valued vector is improper, and the pseudo-autocorrelation matrix of this improper vector exists. Moreover, if components of an improper complex-valued vector are uncorrelated, except the autocorrelation matrix, the pseudo-autocorrelation matrix should also be diagonal. This one more statistics could be useful to design better the complex-valued BSS algorithm and MVDR beamforming algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685500/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10398065","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685500/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Second-order improperness in frequency-domain colored signal model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-order improperness in frequency-domain colored signal model","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07584S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670334","isNumber":"4685440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670334","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4685440","articleId":"4685500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685562,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The model of the controller could be considered as a very simplified clone of the biological controller. External control that we advocate uses a hierarchical model that interfaces the biological systems at the level of command, and the level of execution. At the top level discrete sequential model of movement is implemented and relies on temporal synergies typical for biological control and sensors information. At the coordination level the decomposition to lower centers is implemented based on spatial synergies. At the actuator level customized biomechanical models need to be used in order to match the performances of the system. The top and coordination levels could be best understood as sets of rules having IF-THEN- ELSE form, therefore the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) seem to be the most promising technique for their determination. In this review we describe the essence of the method, and list many of the applications of ANN for designing of the external control for NP. In addition, five presentations that follow discuss the mapping of the sensors information to the control of individual muscles, mapping of the sensors information for the synthesis of gait phases, use of ANN for determination of optimal electrode, application of wavelet to extract the important component of biological signals for control of movement) [41\u201345].","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685584/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10397987","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685584/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"External control of movements and artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"External control of movements and artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"SPI-11152008-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085484S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667703","isNumber":"4685533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667703","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4685533","articleId":"4685584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4685596,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Fahmy Hashem","affiliation":["Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hassan Fahmy","lastName":"Hashem","id":"37297913500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2903-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2904-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4685596","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Neural networks","Face recognition","Image recognition","Working environment noise","Gaussian noise","White noise","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Karhunen-Loeve transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","conjugate gradient methods","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face image recognition","face image detection","noisy environment","eigenface method","back propagation neural network","conjugate gradient learning rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Image Processing","Human Face","Gaussian white noise","Poisson noise","salt and pepper noise"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685596","abstract":"This paper suggested new systematic analysis of faces images detection and recognition.

The adaptive equalizers eliminate the need for explicit channel impulse response estimation at the receiver. The length of the time-domain adaptive equalizer is also independent of the data block length, making it particularly suitable for frequency selective fading channels with short delay spreads. We derive the block minimum mean square error solutions for both time- and frequency-domain distributed TR-STBC systems and from these we develop recursive least squares adaptive algorithms for the block structures. We use computer simulations to compare both the time- and frequency-domain adaptive equalizers for amplify-and-forward relay networks. We show that the adaptive algorithms work well for Protocols I and III proposed by Nabar The time-domain adaptive algorithms perform better than the frequency-domain algorithms, and overall the Protocol I receivers outperform the Protocol III receivers. We also show that, if only the Protocol III receiver is used, it can be susceptible to noise amplification due to a weaker source-to-relay link compared to the relay-to-destination link. This problem can be mitigated by using the Protocol I receivers with some extra complexity but much superior diversity performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2009890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2009890","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4783546/04685625.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Joint Decoding and Equalization for Space-Time Block-Coded Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Joint Decoding and Equalization for Space-Time Block-Coded Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","volume":"57","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685625/","accessionNumber":"10498800","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685625/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Joint Decoding and Equalization for Space-Time Block-Coded Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-garth-2009890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095832S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4783546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4783546","articleId":"4685625","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4685631,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shibayama","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shibayama","id":"37284207700"},{"name":"Ryoji Ando","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoji","lastName":"Ando","id":"37587467100"},{"name":"Akifumi Nomura","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akifumi","lastName":"Nomura","id":"37682662900"},{"name":"Junji Yamauchi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37267404500"},{"name":"Hisamatsu Nakano","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisamatsu","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37277793100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4685631","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1253},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"A concise formulation of the frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is presented using the trapezoidal recursive convolution (TRC) technique for the analysis of a Drude-Lorentz model.

It does not cover all types of basic concerns that the stakeholders communicate. These include beliefs, desires, intentions, and attitudes. In response, we propose a core ontology that covers these concerns and is grounded in sound conceptual foundations resting on a foundational ontology. The new core ontology for RE leads to a new formulation of the requirements problem that extends Zave and Jackson's formulation.

In practice this means that it is not possible to objectively determine if a projects SRS fails to reach a certain quality threshold. Therefore, a commonly agreed-on quality model is needed. Additionally, a large set of empirical data is needed to establish a correlation between project success and quality levels. As there is no such quality model, we had to define our own based on the goal-question-metric (GQM) method. Based on this we analyzed more than 40 software projects (student projects in undergraduate software engineering classes), in order to contribute to the empirical part. This paper contributes in three areas: Firstly, we outline our GQM plan and our set of metrics. They were derived from widespread literature, and hence could lead to a discussion of how to measure requirements quality. Practitioners and researchers can profit from our experience, when measuring the quality of their requirements. Secondly, we present our findings. We hope that others find these valuable when comparing them to their own results. Finally,we show that the results of our quality assessment correlate to project success.

Their attractiveness resides in their elegant treatment of nonlinear problems. They have been successfully applied to pattern recognition, regression and density estimation. A common characteristic of kernel-based methods is that they deal with kernel expansions whose number of terms equals the number of input data, making them unsuitable for online applications. Recently, several solutions have been proposed to circumvent this computational burden in time series prediction problems. Nevertheless, most of them require excessively elaborate and costly operations. In this paper, we investigate a new model reduction criterion that makes computationally demanding sparsification procedures unnecessary. The increase in the number of variables is controlled by the coherence parameter, a fundamental quantity that characterizes the behavior of dictionaries in sparse approximation problems. We incorporate the coherence criterion into a new kernel-based affine projection algorithm for time series prediction. We also derive the kernel-based normalized LMS algorithm as a particular case. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare our approach to existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"57","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10498805","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4685707/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Online Prediction of Time Series Data With Kernels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Prediction of Time Series Data With Kernels","sourcePdf":"tsp-richard-2009895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084673S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4783546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"307","xplore-issue":"4783546","articleId":"4685707","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4685795,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Edelkamp","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Dortmund University, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Edelkamp","id":"37427467700"},{"name":"Damian Sulewski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Dortmund University, Germany"],"firstName":"Damian","lastName":"Sulewski","id":"37871511500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3437-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-0255"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7656"}],"articleNumber":"4685795","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"Solid state disks based on flash memory are an apparent alternative to hard disks for external memory search.

So data de-duplication, which uses lossless data compression schemes to minimize the duplicated data at the inter-file level, has been receiving broad attention in recent years. But there are still research challenges in current approaches and storage systems, such as: how to chunking the files more efficiently and better leverage potential similarity and identity among dedicated applications; how to store the chunks effectively and reliably into secondary storage devices. In this paper, we propose ADMAD: an application-driven metadata aware de-duplication archival storage system, which makes use of certain meta-data information of different levels in the I/O path to direct the file partitioning into more meaningful data chunks (MC) to maximally reduce the inter-file level duplications. However, the chunks may be with different lengths and variable sizes, storing them into storage devices may result in a lot of fragments and involve a high percentage of random disk accesses, which is very inefficient. Therefore, in ADMAD, chunks are further packaged into fixed sized objects as the storage units to speed up the I/O performance as well as to ease the data management. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that the proposed system can further reduce the required storage space when compared with current methods (from 20% to near 50% according to several datasets), and largely improves the writing performance (about 50%-70% in average).","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel

It is shown that the performance degradation of OFDM-UWB signals caused by fiber dispersion is due to the power fading induced on the subcarrier showing stronger fading. Results show that the power fading description based on a small signal analysis provides good estimates of the optical signal-to-noise ratio degradation for OFDM-UWB signals with modulation index (defined as the ratio between the root-mean-square voltage of the OFDM-UWB signal and the bias voltage of the Mach-Zehnder modulator) values up to 18%. This is a pessimistic value for some OFDM-UWB carrier frequencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Degradation Due to OFDM-UWB Radio Signal Transmission Along Dispersive Single-Mode Fiber","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2008.2009231","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/4749402/04685853.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2008.2009231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Degradation Due to OFDM-UWB Radio Signal Transmission Along Dispersive Single-Mode Fiber","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4685853/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10478031","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Degradation Due to OFDM-UWB Radio Signal Transmission Along Dispersive Single-Mode Fiber","sourcePdf":"lpt-alves-2009231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127886S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4749402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4749402","articleId":"4685853","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4685855,"authors":[{"name":"Darko Zibar","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Darko","lastName":"Zibar","id":"37269751000"},{"name":"Xianbin Yu","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37293164700"},{"name":"Christophe Peucheret","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Peucheret","id":"37275046400"},{"name":"Palle Jeppesen","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Palle","lastName":"Jeppesen","id":"37277666000"},{"name":"Idelfonso T.

The chosen planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) are intended to operate in the UMTS band [1.92-2.17] GHz and more precisely in the UMTS Rx band for diversity purpose. First, the distance between the PIFAs is severely reduced to 4 mm (0.027 lambda\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n) in order to obtain a very compact system. This proximal placement causes an increase of the insertion loss between the feeding ports of the PIFAs and therefore degrades the overall diversity performance of the two-antenna system. To compensate for this effect, the neutralization technique previously proposed by the same authors is implemented. Then, a novel way to implement this technique is studied to further improve the PIFAs' port-to-port isolation. It consists in achieving the neutralization of the antennas trough folded lines connected to the printed circuit board (PCB). A new prototype is fabricated and measured. The S-parameters and the total efficiency are presented. Additionally, the most important diversity metrics are computed to evaluate the potential of this novel two-antenna system for diversity applications in the UMTS Rx mode.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Isolation Technique for Closely Spaced PIFAs for UMTS Mobile Phones","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2008.2009887","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4446029/04685857.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2008.2009887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Isolation Technique for Closely Spaced PIFAs for UMTS Mobile Phones","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4685857/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10478084","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Isolation Technique for Closely Spaced PIFAs for UMTS Mobile Phones","sourcePdf":"lawp-cluxey-2009887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08342S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4446029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4446029","articleId":"4685857","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4685858,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm, which uses a subcell model in form of the thin-wire approximation to model wire antennas, has been validated numerically using published numerical electromagnetic code (NEC) data for dipole antennas, and experimentally by comparing with measurements obtained for a monopole antenna array. The agreement between calculated and measured performances of the monopoles is close. In order to understand the fabrication tolerance, a parametric study was performed with regards to position of ground plane and grid size. It is found that the ground plane plays an important role in the performance of the monopole antennas. The excellent agreement is very promising for future deployment of the algorithm in 3-D microwave tomography applications.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2008.2009888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4446029/04685858.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2008.2009888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measured Antenna Response of a Proposed Microwave Tomography System Using an Efficient 3-D FDTD Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685858/","displayDocTitle":"Measured Antenna Response of a Proposed Microwave Tomography System Using an Efficient 3-D FDTD Model","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10478083","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685858/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured Antenna Response of a Proposed Microwave Tomography System Using an Efficient 3-D FDTD Model","sourcePdf":"lawp-spadhi-2009888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4446029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4446029","articleId":"4685858","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4685859,"authors":[{"name":"Minghua Xia","affiliation":["Beijing Research and Development Center, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Minghua","lastName":"Xia","id":"37627903000"},{"name":"Yuanping Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yuanping","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37592209200"},{"name":"Jeounglak Ha","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommucations Research Institute, Broadcasting and Telecommunications Convergence Research Laboratory, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeounglak","lastName":"Ha","id":"37402920600"},{"name":"Hyun Kyu Chung","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommucations Research Institute, Broadcasting and Telecommunications Convergence Research Laboratory, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Kyu","lastName":"Chung","id":"37291608400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4685859","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"The opportunistic beamforming system (OBS) is currently receiving much attention in the field of downlink beamforming due to its simple random beamforming, low feedback complexity, and same throughput scaling obtained with perfect channel-state information using dirty paper coding at the transmitter. In this paper, we focus on its closed-form throughput evaluation over Rayleigh fading channels, based on the asymptotic theory of extreme order statistics. First, the throughput of a single-beam OBS is investigated, and an analytical solution tighter than the previously reported one is derived. Then, the asymptotic throughput bounds on a multibeam OBS are presented, and also, our analytical expression is shown to be very tight with the simulation results even with fewer users. After that, we argue that the reported conclusion that the single-beam OBS is much preferable to the multibeam OBS in the high-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime is inaccurate, but that, instead, it is satisfied only when the number of users is very small, due to its limited multiuser diversity gain. Finally, we show that four transmit beams is the most preferable in the multibeam OBS with a large number of users and moderate SNR, which arrives at the tradeoff between increasing spatial multiplexing gain and disappearing multiuser diversity gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04685859.pdf","startPage":"2608","endPage":"2614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2009756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2009756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Beamforming Communication With Throughput Analysis Using Asymptotic Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Throughput","Feedback","Diversity methods","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Statistics","Radio transmitters","Research and development","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","multiuser channels","Rayleigh channels","space division multiplexing","statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic approach","opportunistic beamforming communication","throughput analysis","downlink beamforming","simple random beamforming","low feedback complexity","perfect channel-state information","dirty paper coding","Rayleigh fading channels","asymptotic theory","high-signal-to-noise-ratio","multiuser diversity gain","spatial multiplexing gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input single-output (MISO)","multiuser diversity","opportunistic beamforming system (OBS)","spatial multiplexing","throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Beamforming Communication With Throughput Analysis Using Asymptotic Approach","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4685859/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645575","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Beamforming Communication With Throughput Analysis Using Asymptotic Approach","sourcePdf":"tvt-xia-2009756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093662S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4685859","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4685860,"authors":[{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4685860/4685860-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingyang Song (M'07) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in differential space time codes and multiple-input\u2013multiple-output from the University of York, York, U.K., in 2007.","From January to September 2003, he was a Software Engineer with Hwasun Tomorrow Technology, Beijing, China.

The proposed equalizer design makes efficient use of the special time-domain representation of multipath channels through a matched filter, a sliding window, a Gaussian approximation, and a decision feedback. The A-ML-DFBE has the following features: 1) It achieves a performance that is close that to that of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) and significantly outperforms minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based detectors. 2) It has substantially lower complexity than conventional equalizers. 3) It easily realizes complexity and performance tradeoff by adjusting the length of the sliding window. 4) It has a simple and fixed-length feedback filter. The symbol error rate (SER) is derived to characterize the behavior of the A-ML-DFBE and can also be used to find the key parameters of the proposed equalizer. In addition, we further prove that the A-ML-DFBE obtains full multipath diversity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Fading","Maximum likelihood estimation","Intersymbol interference","Maximum likelihood detection","Feedback","Frequency","Time domain analysis","Multipath channels","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","decision feedback equalisers","diversity reception","fading channels","intersymbol interference","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly selective fading channels","intersymbol interference","maximum likelihood decision feedback block equalizer","frequency selective fading channel","time selective fading channel","time domain representation","multipath channels","matched filter","sliding window","Gaussian approximation","decision feedback","fixed length feedback filter","multipath diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly selective fading channels","equalization","linear minimum mean square error (MMSE)","matched filter","maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE)","MMSE decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2009758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04685860.pdf","startPage":"2314","endPage":"2321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2009758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate ML Decision-Feedback Block Equalizer for Doubly Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximate ML Decision-Feedback Block Equalizer for Doubly Selective Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685860/","volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685860/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10645573","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate ML Decision-Feedback Block Equalizer for Doubly Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-song-2009758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071223S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4685860","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4685861,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Kong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4685861/4685861-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Kong received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering and the M.Eng. degree in communication and information systems from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Hong Kong, in 2008.","From 1999 to 2004, he was a Lecturer on R&D of 3G WCDMA core networks with the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, HUST.

However, a number of research challenges remain to be tackled. One of the most important challenges is the design of a judicious packet scheduler that will make efficient use of the spectrum bandwidth. Due to the multicarrier nature of the OFDM systems, the applicability and performance of traditional wireless packet-scheduling algorithms, which are usually designed for single-carrier systems, are largely unknown. In th.is paper, we propose a new quality-of-service (QoS)-aware proportional fairness (QPF) packet-scheduling policy with low complexity for the downlink of multiuser OFDM systems to allocate radio resources among users. Our proposed algorithm is based on a cross-layer design in that the scheduler is aware of both the channel (i.e., physical layer) and the queue state (i.e., data link layer) information to achieve proportional fairness while maximizing each user's packet-level QoS performance. The simulation results show that the proposed QPF algorithm is efficient in terms of average system throughput, packet-dropping probability, and packet delay, while maintaining adequate fairness among users with relatively low scheduling overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2009874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04685861.pdf","startPage":"2225","endPage":"2235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2009874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity QoS-Aware Proportional Fair Multicarrier Scheduling Algorithm for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685861/","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity QoS-Aware Proportional Fair Multicarrier Scheduling Algorithm for OFDM Systems","volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645574","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685861/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity QoS-Aware Proportional Fair Multicarrier Scheduling Algorithm for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-kong-2009874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0707S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4685861","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4685863,"authors":[{"name":"Weiqi Xue","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Weiqi","lastName":"Xue","id":"37302519000"},{"name":"Salvador Sales","affiliation":["ITEAM Institute, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Sales","id":"37277075700"},{"name":"Jesper Mork","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper","lastName":"Mork","id":"37277862700"},{"name":"Jos\u00c9 Capmany","affiliation":["ITEAM Institute, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00c9","lastName":"Capmany","id":"37277073500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4685863","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":665},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685863","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave filters","Fast light","Optical filters","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical refraction","Optical modulation","Stimulated emission","Optical attenuators","Optical tuning","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser tuning","microwave photonics","notch filters","semiconductor optical amplifiers","slow light","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable microwave photonic notch filter","slow light effects","spectral response","tuning mechanism","semiconductor optical amplifiers","optical filtering","fast light effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent population oscillations (CPO)","microwave photonics","semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)","slow light"]}],"abstract":"A continuously tunable microwave photonic notch filter at around 30 GHz is experimentally demonstrated and 100% fractional tuning over 360deg range is achieved without changing the shape of the spectral response.

Three-dimensional SAR imaging, also known as SAR tomography, uses multiple views to profile the scattering power at different heights. This technique has been shown to be capable of separating interfering target responses on real data. Differential SAR tomography has been recently proposed as a technique that extends the potentialities of SAR tomography to the target deformation monitoring. It performs a 4-D space-velocity imaging that enables not only separating interfering targets in elevation but also distinguishing their single slow deformation velocities. This work addresses for the first time the application of 4-D SAR imaging to real data to determine the height and mean deformation velocity of single scatterers and double-scattering mechanisms interfering at high resolution in the same pixel. It also discusses the postprocessing steps required to identify the presence of stable single and double scatterers after elevation-velocity focusing. Moreover, it proposes a technique for the extraction of time series from interfering targets to measure possible nonlinear temporal deformations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4729687/04685869.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2000837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2000837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-Dimensional SAR Imaging for Height Estimation and Monitoring of Single and Double Scatterers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar polarimetry","Monitoring","Radar scattering","Tomography","Pixel","Synthetic aperture radar","Interferometry","Image resolution","Focusing","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","height measurement","radar signal processing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["height estimation","single scatterer monitoring","double scatterer monitoring","target contribution superposition","ground scatterers","multipass SAR interferometry","synthetic aperture radar","differential SAR tomography","4D space-velocity imaging","interfering target separation","slow deformation velocity","4D SAR imaging application","mean deformation velocity","SAR signal postprocessing","nonlinear temporal deformations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography","multibaseline/multitemporal coherent SAR processing","permanent scatterers interferometry","4-D SAR imaging"]},{"kwd":["Differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography","multibaseline/multitemporal coherent SAR processing","permanent scatterers interferometry","4-D SAR imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Four-Dimensional SAR Imaging for Height Estimation and Monitoring of Single and Double Scatterers","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4685869/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370925","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-Dimensional SAR Imaging for Height Estimation and Monitoring of Single and Double Scatterers","sourcePdf":"tgrs-fornaro-2000837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077285S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4729687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"4729687","articleId":"4685869","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4685877,"authors":[{"name":"Angus C.

The proposed structure consists of two antenna elements and a coupling element which is located in between the two antenna elements. The idea is to use field cancellation to enhance isolation by putting a coupling element which artificially creates an additional coupling path between the antenna elements. To validate the idea, a design for a USB dongle MIMO antenna for the 2.4 GHz WLAN band is presented. In this design, the antenna elements are etched on a compact low-cost FR4 PCB board with dimensions of 20times40times1.6 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n.

The proposed receiver consists of two stages following each other. The first stage performs soft interference cancellation and group-blind linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering, and the second stage performs channel decoding. The proposed group-blind linear MMSE filter suppresses the residual multiple-access interference (MAI) from known users based on the spreading sequences and the channel characteristics of these users while suppressing the interference from other unknown users using a subspace-based blind method. The proposed receiver is suitable for suppressing intercell interference in heavily loaded CDMA systems. Since the knowledge of the number of unknown users is crucial for the proposed receiver structure, a novel estimator is also proposed to estimate the number of unknown users in the system by exploiting the statistical properties of the received signal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator can provide the number of unknown users with high accuracy; in addition, the proposed group-blind receiver integrated with the new estimator can significantly outperform the conventional turbo multiuser detector in the presence of unknown users.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04685878.pdf","startPage":"2299","endPage":"2313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2009940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2009940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Group-Blind Multiuser Detection and Decoding With Signal Rank Estimation for Coded CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Iterative decoding","Multiaccess communication","Interference suppression","Multiple access interference","Nonlinear filters","Interference cancellation","Mean square error methods","Filtering","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","filtering theory","interference suppression","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","multiuser detection","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo multiuser detector","iterative decoding","signal rank estimation","code-division multiple-access","interference cancellation","group-blind detector","group-blind receiver","linear minimum mean square error filtering","rank estination","multiple-access interference","intercell interference suppression","channel decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems","group-blind detector","interference cancellation","rank estimation","turbo multiuser detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Group-Blind Multiuser Detection and Decoding With Signal Rank Estimation for Coded CDMA Systems","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4685878/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645572","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Group-Blind Multiuser Detection and Decoding With Signal Rank Estimation for Coded CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-shahrrava-2009940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070387S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4685878","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4685881,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew R.

The operating frequency is electronically tuned by incorporating an array of phase agile reflection cells on a thin substrate above the ground plane of the resonator antenna, where the reflection phase of each cell is controlled by the bias voltage applied to a pair of varactor diodes. The new configuration enables continuous tuning of the antenna from 5.2 GHz to 5.95 GHz using commercially available varactor diodes, thus covering frequencies typically used for WLAN applications. Both the PRS and phase agile cell are analyzed, and theoretical and measured results for gain, tuning range, and radiation patterns of the reconfigurable antenna are described. The effect of the varactor diode series resistance on the performance of the antenna is also reported.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable High-Gain Partially Reflecting Surface Antenna","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2005538","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4685873/04685881.pdf","startPage":"3382","endPage":"3390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2005538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable High-Gain Partially Reflecting Surface Antenna","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4685881/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324322","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable High-Gain Partially Reflecting Surface Antenna","sourcePdf":"56tap11-aweily-2005538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080512S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4685873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"4685873","articleId":"4685881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4685882,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel P.

The technique is applicable to general dispersive materials, although the required convolution calculations can be greatly accelerated when the electric and magnetic susceptibilities can be represented by a pole expansion. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and capability of the proposed numerical approach which is effective for the efficient broadband analysis of complex periodic structures such as engineered materials and phased-array antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2005454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4685873/04685897.pdf","startPage":"3501","endPage":"3509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2005454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Element Time-Domain Analysis of Electrically and Magnetically Dispersive Periodic Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685897/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Element Time-Domain Analysis of Electrically and Magnetically Dispersive Periodic Structures","volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324325","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685897/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Element Time-Domain Analysis of Electrically and Magnetically Dispersive Periodic Structures","sourcePdf":"56tap11-driley-2005454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078716S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4685873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4685873","articleId":"4685897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4685898,"authors":[{"name":"Chris H.Q.

However, popular classification algorithms, e.g., common spatial patterns (CSP), usually highly depend on the prior neurophysiologic knowledge for noise removing, although this knowledge is not always known in practical applications. In this paper, a novel tensor-based scheme is proposed for single trial EEG classification, which performs well without the prior neurophysiologic knowledge. In this scheme, EEG signals are represented in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain by the wavelet transform, the multilinear discriminative subspace is reserved by the general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA), redundant indiscriminative patterns are removed by Fisher score, and the classification is conducted by the support vector machine (SVM). Applications to three datasets confirm the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed tensor scheme in analyzing EEG signals, especially in the case of lacking prior neurophysiologic knowledge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10560667","pubMedId":"19273039","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4685904/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Prior Neurophysiologic Knowledge Free Tensor-Based Scheme for Single Trial EEG Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Prior Neurophysiologic Knowledge Free Tensor-Based Scheme for Single Trial EEG Classification","sourcePdf":"tnsre-dtao-2008394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09124S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4812307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4812307","articleId":"4685904","onlineDate":"21 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4685909,"authors":[{"name":"Iftikhar Ahmed","affiliation":["Electromagnetics System Department, Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore"],"firstName":"Iftikhar","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37278560000"},{"name":"Eng-Kee Chua","affiliation":["Electromagnetics System Department, Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore"],"firstName":"Eng-Kee","lastName":"Chua","id":"37297906500"},{"name":"Er-Ping Li","affiliation":["Electromagnetics System Department, Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore"],"firstName":"Er-Ping","lastName":"Li","id":"37277829200"},{"name":"Zhizhang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhizhang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278564400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4685909","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1256},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A three-dimensional unconditionally-stable locally-one-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (LOD-FDTD) method is proposed and is proved unconditionally stable analytically.

We build a universal filter whose per-symbol squared error, for every bounded underlying signal, is essentially as small as that of the best finite-duration impulse response (FIR) filter of a given order. We do not assume a stochastic mechanism generating the underlying signal, and assume only that the variance of the noise is known to the filter. The regret of the expected MSE of our scheme is shown to decay as O(logn/n), where n is the length of the signal. Moreover, we present a stronger concentration result which guarantees the performance of our scheme not only in expectation, but also with high probability. Our result implies a conventional stochastic setting result, i.e., when the underlying signal is a stationary process, our filter achieves the performance of the optimal FIR filter. We back our theoretical findings with several experiments showcasing the potential merits of our universal filter in practice.

To model complex targets for radar simulations, the plurality of scattering centers should be reduced to few significant scattering centers in order to minimize computational effort. The scope of this work is to present a technique to generate a significantly simplified RCS model of the vehicle with a limited number of virtual scattering centers, each with its own scattering characteristic, and how to group these scattering centers in a cluster database. The work is based on ray-tracing simulations of complex vehicle models. The ray-tracing simulations have been validated by measurements. The scattering centers may not be physically existing strong scattering centers, but virtual scattering centers representing a certain scattering behavior. In this paper, a technique for extracting such virtual scattering centers from a complex 3D-vehicle-model is presented. It is based on ray-tracing simulations of such models. As an example, the design model of a Ford Focus is used.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4685873/04685913.pdf","startPage":"3543","endPage":"3551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2005436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2005436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of Virtual Scattering Centers of Vehicles by Ray-Tracing Simulations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Ray tracing","Radar scattering","Computational modeling","Radar cross section","Radar imaging","Quantum computing","Character generation","Databases","Focusing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive engineering","radar imaging","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual scattering centers","ray-tracing simulations","radar images","radar simulations","scattering characteristic","cluster database","complex 3D vehicle model","Ford Focus"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ray-tracing","RCS-modeling","scattering center"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of Virtual Scattering Centers of Vehicles by Ray-Tracing Simulations","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4685913/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324336","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of Virtual Scattering Centers of Vehicles by Ray-Tracing Simulations","sourcePdf":"tap-schuler-2005436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054959S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"4685873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","articleId":"4685913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4685916,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Carluccio","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4685873/4685916/4685916-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giorgio Carluccio was born in Poggiardo, Lecce, Italy, in 1979.

The algorithm assumes a given sequence of infinite edges and complete visibility among them. The ray tracing problem is formulated as the minimization of the ray total path length. Since such a cost function is strictly convex, except for coplanar edges in the plane-wave far-field regime, then the problem admits a unique global minimum and allows the use of a modified Newton search algorithm, which exhibits a very high converging rate. We also propose a convenient starting point to effectively initialize the minimization algorithm.

A significant penetration depth in all the polarimetric channels and a wide range of polarimetric phase center heights are observed, attesting of an interaction of the radar waves with different forest structural elements. The main objective of this paper concerns forest height inversion at P-band. First, forest-modeling assumptions are evaluated using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">priori</i>\n information, such as ground-level and forest height measurements. The full extend of the forest height is shown to be responsible of the volume decorrelation, and a significant orientation effect is clearly identified over the highest stands. As a consequence, the Oriented Volume over Ground model (OVoG) is determined to be the most appropriated model for the forest height inversion. At P-band, the ground contribution is present in all the polarimetric channels due to the important penetration at this frequency. To overcome this difficulty, a time-frequency optimization method based on sublook decomposition is developed to separate the pure ground and canopy contributions, allowing forest height estimation with OVoG with an rms error on the order of 2 m. In the last section of this paper, a sensitivity analysis of the inversion with respect to two important system parameters, the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolution, is presented, leading to a discussion on the inversion robustness in spaceborne conditions, where these system parameters are the most deteriorated as compared to airborne configurations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spaceborne radar","Ground penetrating radar","Radar polarimetry","Decorrelation","Time frequency analysis","Optimization methods","Sensitivity analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Signal resolution","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","height measurement","radar interferometry","radar polarimetry","synthetic aperture radar","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forest height inversion","high-resolution P-band Pol-InSAR data","airborne RAMSES system","pine forest stands","polarimetric phase center heights","radar waves","forest structural elements","Oriented Volume over Ground model","time-frequency optimization method","canopy contributions","signal-to-noise ratio","frequency 427 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forestry","interferometry","polarimetric radar","radar imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.922032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4685926/04685935.pdf","startPage":"3544","endPage":"3559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4685926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.922032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forest Height Inversion Using High-Resolution P-Band Pol-InSAR Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4685935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Forest Height Inversion Using High-Resolution P-Band Pol-InSAR Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4685935/","volume":"46","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4685935/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10324405","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forest Height Inversion Using High-Resolution P-Band Pol-InSAR Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-garestier-922032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097893S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4685926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4685926","articleId":"4685935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":4685943,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel F.

In both steps, we make the hypothesis that target statistics are at least approximately known.

The approach is an extension of previous approaches and uses both the spatial and spectral information for classification. One previous approach is based on using several principal components (PCs) from the hyperspectral data and building several morphological profiles (MPs). These profiles can be used all together in one extended MP. A shortcoming of that approach is that it was primarily designed for classification of urban structures and it does not fully utilize the spectral information in the data. Similarly, the commonly used pixelwise classification of hyperspectral data is solely based on the spectral content and lacks information on the structure of the features in the image. The proposed method overcomes these problems and is based on the fusion of the morphological information and the original hyperspectral data, i.e., the two vectors of attributes are concatenated into one feature vector. After a reduction of the dimensionality, the final classification is achieved by using a support vector machine classifier. The proposed approach is tested in experiments on ROSIS data from urban areas. Significant improvements are achieved in terms of accuracies when compared to results obtained for approaches based on the use of MPs based on PCs only and conventional spectral classification. For instance, with one data set, the overall accuracy is increased from 79% to 83% without any feature reduction and to 87% with feature reduction. The proposed approach also shows excellent results with a limited training set.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.922034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.922034","startPage":"3804","endPage":"3814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4686006/04686022.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral and Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using SVMs and Morphological Profiles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectral and Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using SVMs and Morphological Profiles","volume":"46","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324437","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686022/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral and Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using SVMs and Morphological Profiles","sourcePdf":"tgrs-fauvel-pt1-922034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106157S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4686006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"716","xplore-issue":"4686006","articleId":"4686022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4686026,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Minnis","affiliation":["Science Directorate, NASA-Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4686006/4686026/4686026-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patrick Minnis received the B.E. degree in materials science and metallurgical engineering from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, in 1972, the M.S. degree in atmospheric science from Colorado State University, Fort Collins, in 1978, and the Ph.D. degree in meteorology from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, in 1991.","He is currently a Senior Research Scientist with the Climate Science Branch, Science Directorate, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, where he has served for more than 27 years.

The daytime method uses the 0.65-, 3.8-, 10.8-, and 12.0-mum channels on the TRMM Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and the Terra and Aqua MODIS. The VIRS and Terra 1.6-mum channel and the Aqua 1.38- and 2.1-mum channels are used secondarily. The primary nighttime radiances are from the 3.8-, 10.8-, and 12.0- mum channels. Significant differences were found between the VIRS and Terra 1.6-mum and the Terra and Aqua 3.8-mum channels' calibrations. Cascading threshold tests provide clear or cloudy classifications that are qualified according to confidence levels or other conditions, such as sunglint, that affect the classification. The initial infrared threshold test classifies ~43% of the pixels as clouds. The next level seeks consistency in three (two) different channels during daytime (nighttime) and accounts for roughly 40% (25%) of the pixels. The third tier uses refined thresholds to classify remaining pixels. For cloudy pixels, ~ 4% yield no retrieval when analyzed with a cloud retrieval algorithm. The techniques were applied to data between 1998 and 2006 to yield average nonpolar cloud amounts of ~ 0.60. Averages among the platforms differ by <0.01 and are comparable to surface climatological values, but roughly 0.07 less than means from two other satellite analyses, primarily as a result of missing small subpixel and thin clouds.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2001351","startPage":"3857","endPage":"3884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2001351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686006","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4686006/04686026.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Detection in Nonpolar Regions for CERES Using TRMM VIRS and Terra and Aqua MODIS Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686026/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cloud Detection in Nonpolar Regions for CERES Using TRMM VIRS and Terra and Aqua MODIS Data","volume":"46","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4686026/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10324420","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Detection in Nonpolar Regions for CERES Using TRMM VIRS and Terra and Aqua MODIS Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-minnis-2001351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144687S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4686006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"4686006","articleId":"4686026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4686228,"authors":[{"name":"Non Yok","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Drexel University, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Non Yok","id":"37546614800"},{"name":"Gail Rosen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Drexel University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Gail","lastName":"Rosen","id":"37545769100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2890-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4686228","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Organisms","Probes","DNA","Sequences","Testing","Sparse matrices","Design engineering","Soil","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","biology computing","data compression","decoding","iterative methods","lab-on-a-chip","probes","search problems","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative approach","compressive sensing DNA microarray probe design","shortest sequence","search space","hybridization affinity","belief propagation","nonlinear decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The compressive sensing microarrays design was proposed by Sheikh et. al as an efficient way of sensing organisms in a given environment such as air, water or soil sample. However, Sheik et. al probe candidates are extracted from the shortest sequences among any given group of organisms. This implies that they have a limited search space for the probe candidates. Probes picked in such a way must not be the most optimal probe candidates. In this paper, we introduce an alternative compressive sensing probe picking algorithm, which consider all possible hybridization affinities and chooses the best group identifier probe among all possible probe candidates from all the members of a group. More importantly, we built relatively larger compressive sensing microarrays systems that consist of four or five groups with the total number of 22 organisms. The system that we built can sense all these organisms effectively by using a nonlinear decoding algorithm known as Belief Propagation (BP).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative approach to probe-design for compressive sensing microarrays","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomeidcine Workshops","doi":"10.1109/BIBMW.2008.4686228","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomeidcine Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4675626/4686198/04686228.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBMW.2008.4686228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An iterative approach to probe-design for compressive sensing microarrays","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686228/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10409477","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative approach to probe-design for compressive sensing microarrays","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11182008-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142234S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4675626","isNumber":"4686198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4675626","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4686198","articleId":"4686228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4686257,"authors":[{"name":"Stephane Y.

The main drawback of this technique is that, for each data block, it requires the transmission of several side information bits, which results in some data rate loss. These redundant bits are so critical to the error performance of the system that they need in practice to be protected by a powerful channel code. This increases the system complexity and transmission delay, and decreases the data rate even further. In this paper, we propose a novel SLM method for which no side information needs to be sent. By considering the example of an OFDM system using 16-QAM modulation, it is shown that the proposed method performs very well both in terms of PAPR reduction and bit error rate at the receiver output.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.070021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4686252/04686257.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.070021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686252","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel selected mapping technique for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel selected mapping technique for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324617","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686257/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel selected mapping technique for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"1775-tc0811-legoff.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069865S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4686252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4686252","articleId":"4686257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4686260,"authors":[{"name":"Diomidis S.

Such networks include those using ATM, packet over SONET (POS), and the new generic framing procedure (GFP). Unfortunately, feedback taps inherent in self-synchronous descramblers cause multiplication of transmission errors, which in turn degrades the performance of most linear cyclic error detection/correction codes. This paper analyzes this scrambler/code interaction with respect to the resulting probability of undetectable errors and transmission error correction capability. The theoretical criteria are derived for a linear cyclic code to maintain its error detection and correction performance in the presence of the scramblers. A novel approach for improving the error correction capabilities is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324601","htmlLink":"/document/4686262/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the interaction between linear cyclic error correcting codes and self-synchronous payload scramblers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the interaction between linear cyclic error correcting codes and self-synchronous payload scramblers","sourcePdf":"1800-tc0811-gorshe.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04816S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4686252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4686252","articleId":"4686262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686263,"authors":[{"name":"Renqiu Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4686252/4686263/4686263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renqiu Wang (Member'06) received her B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), 1998, the M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Minnesota, 2003, and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Minnesota, 2006.

The list Viterbi algorithm (LVA) and the iterative Viterbi algorithm (IVA) are two existing approaches capable of recovering erroneously decoded packets. We here employ a soft decoding algorithm for CC decoding, and introduce several schemes to identify error patterns using the posterior information from the CC soft decoding module. The resultant iterative decoding-detecting (IDD) algorithm improves error performance by iteratively updating the extrinsic information based on the CRC parity check matrix. Assuming errors only happen in unreliable bits characterized by small absolute values of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), we also develop a partial IDD (P-IDD) alternative which exhibits comparable performance to IDD by updating only a subset of unreliable bits. We further derive a soft-decision syndrome decoding (SDSD) algorithm, which identifies error patterns from a set of binary linear equations derived from CRC syndrome equations. Being noniterative, SDSD is able to estimate error patterns directly from the decoder output. The packet error rate (PER) performance of SDSD is analyzed following the union bound approach on pairwise errors. Simulations indicate that both IDD and IVA are better tailored for single parity check (PC) codes than for CRC codes. SDSD outperforms both IDD and LVA with weak CC and strong CRC. Applicable to AWGN and flat fading channels, our algorithms can also be extended to turbo coded systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324600","htmlLink":"/document/4686263/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CRC-assisted error correction in a convolutionally coded system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRC-assisted error correction in a convolutionally coded system","sourcePdf":"1807-tc0811-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065438S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4686252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4686252","articleId":"4686263","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686264,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Uwe Schmidt","affiliation":["The Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany","Department of Mathematics, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4686252/4686264/4686264-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai-Uwe Schmidt was born in Dresden, Germany, in 1978.

A lower bound on the achievable PMEPR is established, which is related to the covering radius of the binary code. Generally speaking, the achievable region of the PMEPR shrinks as the covering radius of the binary code decreases. The bound is then applied to some well understood codes, including nonredundant BPSK signaling, BCH codes and their duals, Reed-Muller codes, and convolutional codes. It is demonstrated that most (presumably not optimal) phase-shift designs from the literature attain or approach our bound.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4686252/04686264.pdf","startPage":"1816","endPage":"1823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio of phase-shifted binary codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio of phase-shifted binary codes","volume":"56","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324618","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686264/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio of phase-shifted binary codes","sourcePdf":"1816-tc0811-schmidt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068325S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4686252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4686252","articleId":"4686264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4686265,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Jaspar","affiliation":["Laboratoire de T\u00e9l\u00e9communicationset T\u00e9l\u00e9d\u00e9tection, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4686252/4686265/4686265-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xavier Jaspar was born in Ottignies-Louvain-laNeuve, Belgium, in 1980.

It is a case not considered extensively in the literature so far and the classical concatenation of a VLC and a convolutional code is not satisfying. Through EXIT chart and interleaving gain analysis, we show that the introduction of a repetition code between the VLC and the convolutional code considerably improves global performance.

It is known that when channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter a large performance gain can be achieved. In a system employing time-division duplexing (TDD), CSI can be obtained at the base station if there is reciprocity between the forward and reverse channels. CSI can also be conveyed from the users to the base station via a limited-rate feedback channel in a frequency-division duplexing (FDD) system. In any case, channel estimation errors are inevitable due to the presence of background noise in the estimated signal and due to the finite number of feedback bits used in a limited-rate feedback system model. In this paper, we first consider the general case when partial CSI is available at the transmitter. We derive an MMSE based precoding technique that considers channel estimation errors as an integral part of the system design. Using rate-distortion theory and the generalized Lloyd vector quantization algorithm, we then specialize our results for the more practical limited-rate feedback system model. Compared to previously proposed precoding techniques such as channel inversion and regularized channel inversion, it is shown that the proposed precoding technique significantly improves the average bit error rate (BER) in the system. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed technique is investigated in the high signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) regime.

In this scheme, both the source node and the relay nodes utilize an orthogonal space-time block code for packet retransmission. In contrast to previous cooperative diversity protocols, here cooperative diversity is invoked only if the destination node receives an erroneous packet from the source node. In addition, the relay nodes are not fixed and are selected according to the channel conditions using CRC. It will be shown that this combination of adaptive cooperative diversity and truncated ARQ can greatly improve the system throughput compared to the conventional truncated ARQ scheme and fixed cooperative diversity protocols. We further maximize the throughput by optimizing the packet length and modulation level and will show that substantial gains can be achieved by this joint optimization. Since both the packet length and modulation level are usually discrete in practice, a computationally efficient algorithm is further proposed to obtain the discrete optimal packet length and modulation level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686273/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","volume":"56","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"10324614","publicationDate":"November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686273/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Throughput maximization of ad-hoc wireless networks using adaptive cooperative diversity and truncated ARQ","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput maximization of ad-hoc wireless networks using adaptive cooperative diversity and truncated ARQ","sourcePdf":"1907-tc0811-dai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086475S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4686252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4686252","articleId":"4686273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4686275,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4686252/4686275/4686275-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaohong Jiang (M'03) received his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D degrees in 1989, 1992, and 1999 respectively, all from Xidian University, Xi'an, China.

The present results are very general in that they apply to transmission with differential phase-shift keying, unitary differential space-time modulation (DSTM), and block DSTM and reception with conventional DD (CDD), multiple-symbol DD (MSDD), decision-feedback DD (DFDD), and (differentially) coherent detection (CD). New result for general quadratic forms of Gaussian random variables are derived which allows us to obtain elegant closed-form expressions for the pairwise error probabilities (PEPs) of the dominant error events of the considered detectors. Furthermore, it is shown that a unified treatment of all considered detectors is possible with a properly defined effective signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR) and a useful connection between MSDD and minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) interpolation is established. Interesting novel results obtained from this analysis include: (i) DSTM constellations designed for CDD and CD are also optimum for MSDD and DFDD; (ii) the error floor entailed by MSDD and DFDD in time-variant fading decreases exponentially with the observation window size N; and (iii) in time-variant fading with effective normalized fading bandwidth B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h,eff</sub>\nT MSDD with N \u2192 \u221e suffers only from an SNR loss of (1 -2B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h,eff</sub>\nT) compared to CD, whereas DFDD suffers from a diversity loss of (1 - 2B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h,eff</sub>\nT).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified performance analysis framework for differential detection in MIMO Rayleigh fading channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060692","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4686252/04686279.pdf","startPage":"1972","endPage":"1981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"A unified performance analysis framework for differential detection in MIMO Rayleigh fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4686279/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324603","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified performance analysis framework for differential detection in MIMO Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"1972-tc0811-pauli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089413S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4686252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4686252","articleId":"4686279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4686473,"authors":[{"name":"Chengde Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Chengde Zhang","id":"37087736387"},{"name":"Xiangnian Huang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Xiangnian Huang","id":"37087733116"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2012-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2013-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4686473","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Transfer functions","Training","Neurons","Handwriting recognition","Acceleration","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-line handwritten digit recognition","improved BP artificial neural network","transfer function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP artificial neural network","factor of gradient","transfer function","off-line handwritten digit recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686473","abstract":"This paper improved the adaptive factor of gradient to improve the transfer function on the base of the means of momentum, aimed at the training difficult to escape the flat area of error.

When computers and networks were slow, it was necessary to logically distribute the computation but to physically centralize both the computation and I/O. This is represented by a controller comprised of large rack of embedded processors, with cables to all robot sensors and actuators. As technology improved, it became feasible to distribute both computation and I/O, as illustrated by systems that use a field bus to connect a central controller to low-level processors embedded near or within the robot. This paper advocates a new architecture, centralized processing and distributed I/O, that is enabled by current computer and network technology. This architecture provides benefits in academic environments because it simplifies development of robot control software. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by a custom robot controller that uses IEEE 1394 (FireWire) to provide direct communication between a central computer and non-intelligent peripheral hardware devices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Distributed computing","Computer networks","Embedded computing","Computer architecture","Physics computing","Centralized control","Robot sensing systems","Firewire","Cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","robot programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot control software","centralized processing","distributed I/O","embedded processors","nonintelligent peripheral hardware devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686678","doi":"10.1109/TEPRA.2008.4686678","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Practical Robot Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674452/4686657/04686678.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEPRA.2008.4686678","startPage":"84","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686657","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Practical Robot Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized processing and distributed I/O for robot control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Centralized processing and distributed I/O for robot control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686678/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"10-11 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686678/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408548","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized processing and distributed I/O for robot control","confLoc":"Woburn, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11192008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045706S","chronDate":"10-11 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674452","isNumber":"4686657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674452","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4686657","articleId":"4686678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4686694,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar del Rio Herrero","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"del Rio Herrero","id":"38193133300"},{"name":"Riccardo De Gaudenzi","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"De Gaudenzi","id":"37266746100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2572-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2573-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-4828"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-4836"}],"articleNumber":"4686694","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","Mobile communication","Communication system traffic control","Data acquisition","Automotive engineering","Throughput","Protocols","Multiaccess communication","Artificial satellites","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","automobiles","data acquisition","electronic messaging","interference suppression","internetworking","mobile satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-real-time satellite mobile messaging systems","location-based services","data acquisition services","automotive market","random access channel","packet transmission control","downlink signal quality","Aloha","successive interference cancellation","gateway"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686694","doi":"10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686692","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674525/4686692/04686694.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high efficiency scheme for quasi-real-time satellite mobile messaging systems","abstract":"The manuscript describes the design drivers and performance of a high efficiency quasi-real time satellite mobile messaging system well adapted to the location-based and data acquisition services targeting in particular the automotive market.

In order to counteract the satellite specific propagation conditions, we propose a novel inter-TTI (transmission time interval) interleaving technique allowing to break the channel correlation in slowly time varying channels. The Inter-TTI transmission is achieved through the reuse of the existing HARQ facilities provided by the LTE physical layer. Simulation results show that the proposed technique can be successfully used to improve the performance of the LTE physical layer when applied to the transmission over satellite links. Performance improvement depends on the considered parameters, while complexity can be traded off with the data rate to achieve the best quality of service for the considered system.","doi":"10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686699","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674525/4686692/04686699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686692","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using LTE in 4G satellite communications: Increasing time diversity through forced retransmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using LTE in 4G satellite communications: Increasing time diversity through forced retransmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686699/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408561","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686699/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using LTE in 4G satellite communications: Increasing time diversity through forced retransmission","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-11172008-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040609S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674525","isNumber":"4686692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674525","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4686692","articleId":"4686699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686700,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In single satellite scenarios the proposed STTC and OSTBC techniques proposed offer better BER than plain stream multiplexing along each polarizations and SISO transmissions. By adding a satellite with dual polarization antennas and performing a joint distributed OSTBC, the spectral efficiency increases as the satellites transmit in the same frequency band. Finally the hybrid satellite-terrestrial network has been considered for MIMO transmission. In this case, the spectral efficiency can be multiplied by 4 if a joint encoding of satellite and terrestrial signals is performed. In each scenario the broadcast signal follows the DVB-SH standard.","doi":"10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686701","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674525/4686692/04686701.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO applicability to satellite networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686701/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO applicability to satellite networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408563","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686701/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO applicability to satellite networks","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-11172008-00009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049185S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674525","isNumber":"4686692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674525","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4686692","articleId":"4686701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4686702,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Zorba","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Zorba","id":"38310931600"},{"name":"Marc Realp","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Realp","id":"38274320700"},{"name":"Miguel A.

For example, although SRAM-based FPGAs are beneficial for satellite applications, they are susceptible to SEUs. Harsh environments such as space where cosmic radiation is present increase the likelihood of these errors known as SEUs. However these errors are also expected to be prevalent in non-space applications of future nanometer technologies. Thus this is an important problem to be studied for future secure embedded systems. Satellites require an encryption mechanism for many purposes; for example, to provide secure communications with the ground station. A SEU detection technique for a symmetric encryption algorithm, such as the NIST standardized Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), is additionally challenging due to its complex non-linear task in the algorithm, namely the substitution transformation (sub_byte). This research presents an efficient solution for single-bit SEU detection in the substitution task of AES. This approach uses fewer memory cells, provides 100% single-bit SEU coverage and achieves a low failure in time (FIT). This research is important for secure communications in an error-prone harsh environment such as satellites where low cost and high reliability are important.","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674525/4686692/04686706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SEU-resistant, FPGA-based implementation of the substitution transformation in AES for security on satellites","doi":"10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A SEU-resistant, FPGA-based implementation of the substitution transformation in AES for security on satellites","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408567","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686706/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SEU-resistant, FPGA-based implementation of the substitution transformation in AES for security on satellites","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-11172008-00014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061044S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674525","isNumber":"4686692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674525","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4686692","articleId":"4686706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4686708,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluigi Liva","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Navigation, Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft-und Raumfahrt (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Gianluigi","lastName":"Liva","id":"37392271200"},{"name":"Enrico Paolini","affiliation":["DEIS, WiLAB, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Paolini","id":"37392092900"},{"name":"Marco Chiani","affiliation":["DEIS, WiLAB, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Chiani","id":"37268945300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2572-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2573-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-4828"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-4836"}],"articleNumber":"4686708","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686708","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telemetry","Downlink","Parity check codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Physical layer","Satellite communication","Block codes","Application software","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes","space telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet loss recovery","telemetry downlink","Consultative Committee for space data systems","maximum-likelihood LDPC decoding","generalized irregular repeat-accumulate codes","concatenation codes","maximum distance separable codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","erasure channel","channel coding","satellite communications","CCSDS"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a novel framework for packet loss recovery in the Consultative Committee for space data systems (CCSDS) telemetry downlink is presented. The framework relies on packet-level LDPC erasure correcting codes and on low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. A code design tailored to the ML decoder is presented, which is based on generalized irregular repeat-accumulate (GeIRA) codes. An optional concatenation with outer BCH codes is proposed as a mean for lowering the error floors. Numerical results show that for short block lengths the outer concatenation gives rise to very low error floors, while already for moderate-length codes the concatenation can be skipped without sacrificing the erasure recovery performance. Remarkably, all the proposed schemes under ML decoding tightly approach the performance of ideal maximum distance separable (MDS) codes down to low error rates.","doi":"10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686708","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674525/4686692/04686708.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet loss recovery in the telemetry downlink via maximum-likelihood LDPC decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686708/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Packet loss recovery in the telemetry downlink via maximum-likelihood LDPC decoding","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10408569","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686708/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet loss recovery in the telemetry downlink via maximum-likelihood LDPC decoding","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-11172008-00016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051887S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674525","isNumber":"4686692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674525","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4686692","articleId":"4686708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4686709,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos P.

Emphasis is put on 64APSK constellations. The APSK modulation has merits for digital transmission over nonlinear satellite channels due to its power and spectral efficiency combined with its inherent robustness against nonlinear distortion. This scheme has been adopted in the DVB-S2 Standard for satellite digital video broadcasting. Assuming an ideal rectangular transmission pulse, for which no nonlinear inter-symbol interference is present and perfect pre-compensation of the nonlinearity takes place, we optimize the 64APSK constellation design by employing an optimization criterion based on the mutual information. This method generates an optimum constellation for each operating SNR point, that is, for each spectral efficiency. Two separate cases of interest are particularly examined: (i) the equiprobable case, where all constellation points are equiprobable and (ii) the non-equiprobable case, where the constellation points on each ring are assumed to be equiprobable but the a priory symbol probability associated per ring is assumed different for each ring. Following the mutual information-based optimization approach in each case, detailed simulation results are obtained for the optimal 64APSK constellation settings as well as the achievable shaping gain.","doi":"10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686709","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674525/4686692/04686709.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On 64-APSK constellation design optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686709/","displayDocTitle":"On 64-APSK constellation design optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408570","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686709/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On 64-APSK constellation design optimization","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-11172008-00017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055285S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674525","isNumber":"4686692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674525","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4686692","articleId":"4686709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686718,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Topping","affiliation":["Astrium Limited, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Topping","id":"37866477700"},{"name":"Andrew Bishop","affiliation":["Astrium Limited, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Bishop","id":"37884723300"},{"name":"Tony Craig","affiliation":["Astrium Limited, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Craig","id":"37087333714"},{"name":"David Howe","affiliation":["Astrium Limited, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Howe","id":"37873434200"},{"name":"Jesse Hamer","affiliation":["Astrium Limited, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Hamer","id":"37882440100"},{"name":"Piero Angeletti","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Angeletti","id":"37314190800"},{"name":"Alan Senior","affiliation":["Beckington Castle, SEA (Group) Limited, Somerset, UK"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Senior","id":"37883042100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2572-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2573-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-4828"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-4836"}],"articleNumber":"4686718","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Space technology","Frequency","Contracts","Digital signal processors","Digital signal processing","Testing","Mobile antennas","Satellite antennas","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","array signal processing","mobile antennas","mobile satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S-UMTS processor key technologies demonstrator","digital signal processor prototype","mobile missions","antenna types","beamforming techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686718","abstract":"The S-UMTS processor key technologies demonstrator (built under ESA contract 16024/02/NL/JA) is a digital signal processor (DSP) prototype demonstrating a number of architectures and technologies relevant to the next generation of mobile missions.

The main motivation of MC signaling is its intrinsic ronbustness to multipath (frequency-selective) channels. On the other hand, multipath is known to be one of the dominant sources to the error budget in global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), mainly due to the bias it arises in time of arrival (TOA) estimation. From this viewpoint, it can be argued that MC signals could be adopted in a long-term horizon as ranging signals in GNSSs. In this paper we focus onto the issue of TOA estimation for Filter Bank Multicarrier Modulation (FBMCM) signal. FBMC is preferred as opposed to the well-known OFDM for its stricter spectral limitation and its frequency orthogonality of the subchannels. TOA estimation for FBMCM signals is investigated in terms of Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), with particular emphasis on the comparison with the case of single carrier modulation. As a corollary, it is also shown that MC signals with uneven power distribution can be adopted as an easy implementation of a cognitive positioning system (CPS).","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674525/4686692/04686720.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Workshop on Signal Processing for Space Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPSC.2008.4686720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental issues in time-delay estimation of multicarrier signals with applications to next-generation GNSS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite navigation systems","Time of arrival estimation","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Satellite communication","Digital video broadcasting","Communication standards","Global Positioning System","Filter bank","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","modulation","multipath channels","radio networks","satellite navigation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-delay estimation","multicarrier signals","next-generation GNSS","terrestrial wireless communications","satellite communications","DVB-SH standard","multipath channels","global navigation satellite systems","time of arrival estimation","TOA estimation","Filter Bank Multicarrier Modulation","Cramer-Rao bound","cognitive positioning system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cram\u00e9r Rao Bound","multicarrier","filter bank","OFDM","time-of-arrival estimation","time-delay estimation","GNSS","cognitive positioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental issues in time-delay estimation of multicarrier signals with applications to next-generation GNSS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686720/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408579","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental issues in time-delay estimation of multicarrier signals with applications to next-generation GNSS","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-11172008-00028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11112S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674525","isNumber":"4686692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674525","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4686692","articleId":"4686720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686721,"authors":[{"name":"Gennaro Gallinaro","affiliation":["Space Engineering S.p.A., Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Gennaro","lastName":"Gallinaro","id":"37442286100"},{"name":"Rita Rinaldo","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Rinaldo","id":"37266077900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2572-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2573-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-4828"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-4836"}],"articleNumber":"4686721","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686721","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","Time division multiple access","Satellites","Throughput","Digital video broadcasting","Signal processing algorithms","Interference cancellation","Frequency estimation","Frequency synchronization","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","code division multiple access","digital video broadcasting","interference suppression","satellite links","synchronisation","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference mitigation","TDMA system","turbo-interference cancellation","satellite return link channel","terrestrial wireless CDMA systems","carrier synchronization","satellite terminal","signal processing","DVB-RCS standard","RCS VSAT systems","broadband satellite system","time division multiple access","code division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"In this paper an assessment of the effectiveness of turbo-interference cancellation (Turbo-IC) for improving the spectral efficiency of a TDMA based satellite return link channel will be addressed. Interference mitigation algorithms have been widely studied and implemented in terrestrial wireless CDMA systems. In the present paper Turbo-IC is instead adopted for reducing the carrier spacing on the satellite return channel, thus allowing to increase the system throughput for a given system bandwidth. Performance results show that throughput improvements are possible notwithstanding the higher criticality of carrier synchronization at reduced carrier spacing. It shall be noted that such an improvement in system capacity is achieved without any complexity increase at the satellite terminal (ST), as the additional signal processing required is entirely located at the gateway. Moreover, the proposed technique is fully compatible with DVB-RCS standard, which allows for applicability in current RCS VSAT systems.

Previous work has shown that the erasure recovery capabilities of LDPC-triangle and LDPC-staircase AL-FEC codes can be greatly improved by means of a Gaussian elimination (GE) decoding scheme, possibly coupled to a preliminary Zyablov iterative decoding (ID) scheme. Thanks to the GE decoding, the LDPC-triangle codes were very close to an ideal code. If the LDPC-staircase performances were also improved, they were not as close to an ideal code as the LDPC-triangle codes were. The first goal of this work is to reduce the gap between the LDPC-staircase codes and the theoretical limit. We show that a simple modification of the parity check matrix can significantly improve their recovery capabilities when using a GE decoding.

An S-band dual-band FSS with such structures is designed and fabricated, both simulated and measured results show that the proposed FSS provides high transmission with close band spacing at 2.5 and 3.5 GHz, and there is no other resonance frequency up to 15 GHz. Furthermore, the FSS dimension is miniaturized to 0.082 lambda (lambda refer to the resonant wavelength of 2.5 GHz). Also, it is not sensitive to the angle of oblique incidence wave. The design and discussion about dual-band FSS loading with lumped elements is presented for the first time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Band Capacitive Loaded Frequency Selective Surfaces With Close Band Spacing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2008.2007697","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4686747/04686771.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2008.2007697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Band Capacitive Loaded Frequency Selective Surfaces With Close Band Spacing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4686771/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10349199","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Band Capacitive Loaded Frequency Selective Surfaces With Close Band Spacing","sourcePdf":"lmwc-xu-2007697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042594S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4686747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4686747","articleId":"4686771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686801,"authors":[{"name":"Sermsak Jaruwatanadilok","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4686797/4686801/4686801-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sermsak Jaruwatanadilok (M'03) received the B.E. degree in telecommunication engineering from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Ladkrabang, Thailand, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2003.

The vector radiative transfer equation captures the multiple scattering nature of natural water, and also includes the polarization behavior of light. Light propagation in an underwater environment encounters scattering effect creating dispersion which introduces inter-symbol-interference to the data communication. The attenuation effect further reduces the signal to noise ratio. Both scattering and absorption have adverse effects on underwater data communication. Using a channel model based on radiative transfer theory, we can quantify the scattering effect as a function of distance and bit rate by numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We also investigate the polarization behavior of light in the underwater environment, showing the significance of the cross-polarization component when the light encounters more scattering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","volume":"26","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10324651","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686801/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Underwater Wireless Optical Communication Channel Modeling and Performance Evaluation using Vector Radiative Transfer Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater Wireless Optical Communication Channel Modeling and Performance Evaluation using Vector Radiative Transfer Theory","sourcePdf":"1620jsac1208jaruwatana.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064547S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4686797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4686797","articleId":"4686801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":4686802,"authors":[{"name":"Paul A. van Walree","affiliation":["Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4686797/4686802/4686802-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul van Walree received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in (solid-state) physics from Utrecht University, the Netherlands, in 1992 and 1997, respectively.

Two operation modes of the simulator are evaluated. A replay mode is accomplished by interpolation of measured impulse responses. A second, stochastic mode delivers multiple realizations of a given scattering function. The initial assumption of wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering is violated by strong phase correlations between taps. It is shown that time-varying Doppler shifts due to platform motion must be eliminated from measured scattering functions in order to provide the stochastic tap gains with the true Doppler spectrum of the channel. The simulator is validated through a comparison of acoustic data measured at sea, and emulated data, governed by the same scattering function. This comparison is based on scattering and coherence functions, multipath phase measurements, and application of a decision feedback equalizer. After the Doppler correction, the synthetic data are indistinguishable from the acoustic data in terms of delay-Doppler spread, temporal coherence, phase behavior, equalizer mean square error, and bit error ratio.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4686797/04686802.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686797","startPage":"1628","endPage":"1637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discrete-Time Channel Simulator Driven by Measured Scattering Functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Discrete-Time Channel Simulator Driven by Measured Scattering Functions","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"9","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10324661","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686802/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Discrete-Time Channel Simulator Driven by Measured Scattering Functions","sourcePdf":"1628jsac1208vanwalree.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099325S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4686797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4686797","articleId":"4686802","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686803,"authors":[{"name":"Sean F.

This new method involves transmitting two identical OFDM symbols together with a cyclic prefix, while the receiver uses a bank of parallel self-correlators. Each correlator is matched to a different Doppler scaling factor with respect to the waveform dilation or compression. We characterize the receiver operating characteristic in terms of probability of false alarm and probability of detection. We also analyze the impact of Doppler scale estimation accuracy on the data transmission performance. These analytical results provide guidelines for the selection of the detection threshold and Doppler scale resolution. In addition to computer-based simulations, we have tested the proposed method with real data from an experiment at Buzzards Bay, MA, Dec. 15, 2006. Using only one preamble, the proposed method achieves similar performance on the Doppler scale estimation and the bit error rate as an existing method that uses two linearly-frequencymodulated (LFM) waveforms, one as a preamble and the other as a postamble, around each data burst transmission. Compared with the LFM based method, the proposed method works with a constant detection threshold independent of the noise level and is suited to handle the presence of dense multipath channels. More importantly, the proposed approach does not need to buffer the whole data packet before data demodulation, which facilitates future development of online realtime receivers for multicarrier underwater acoustic communications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","volume":"26","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10324652","htmlLink":"/document/4686803/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection, Synchronization, and Doppler Scale Estimation with Multicarrier Waveforms in Underwater Acoustic Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection, Synchronization, and Doppler Scale Estimation with Multicarrier Waveforms in Underwater Acoustic Communication","sourcePdf":"1638jsac1208mason.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0754S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4686797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"4686797","articleId":"4686803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4686804,"authors":[{"name":"Taehyuk Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4686797/4686804/4686804-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taehyuk Kang Taehyuk Kang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), in 2006, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.

The noncoherent equalizer uses a delay-power-profile estimate (rather than a channel estimate) which is obtained from pilots.

We develop new methods to construct nonbinary regular and irregular LDPC codes that achieve excellent performance, match well with the underlying modulation, and can be encoded in linear time and in a parallel fashion. Based on the fact that the generator matrix of LDPC codes has high density, we further show how to reduce the PAPR considerably with minimal overhead.

Fundamental differences between underwater acoustic propagation and terrestrial radio propagation may call for new criteria for the design of networking protocols. In this paper, we focus on some of these fundamental differences, including attenuation and noise, propagation delays, and the dependence of usable bandwidth and transmit power on distance (which has not been extensively considered before in protocol design studies). Furthermore, the relationship between the energy consumptions of acoustic modems in various modes (i.e., transmit, receive, and idle) is different than that of their terrestrial radio counterparts, which also impacts the design of energy-efficient protocols. The main contribution of this work is an in-depth analysis of the impacts of these unique relationships. We present insights that are useful in guiding both protocol design and network deployment. We design a class of energy-efficient routing protocols for underwater sensor networks based on the insights gained in our analysis. These protocols are tested in a number of relevant network scenarios, and shown to significantly outperform other commonly used routing strategies and to provide near optimal total path energy consumption. Finally, we implement in ns2 a detailed model of the underwater acoustic channel, and study the performance of routing choices when used with a simple MAC protocol and a realistic PHY model, with special regard to such issues as interference and medium access.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4686797/04686813.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1754","endPage":"1766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Routing Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Routing Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686813/","volume":"26","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4686813/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10324662","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Routing Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Networks","sourcePdf":"1754jsac1208zorzi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086919S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4686797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"4686797","articleId":"4686813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4686819,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Soon Park","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang Soon","lastName":"Park","id":"37277790000"},{"name":"Kwang Bok Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang Bok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281491600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4686819","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"In a wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, transmit antenna selection is an effective means of achieving good performance with low complexity.

Under these constraints, we address the problem of statistical multimode transmit antenna subset selection to improve the capacity of spatially correlated MIMO fading channels. In particular, we first derive an analytical closed-form expression for the expectation of the lower bound on the capacity using the smallest eigenvalue distribution of a Wishart matrix.

investigate spatial diversity techniques for free-space optical (FSO) links with intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) over log-normal atmospheric turbulence-induced fading channels. We restrict our attention to the deployment of orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) and repetition codes both of which have been recently proposed for FSO links. Our performance analysis demonstrates that, although both schemes are able to extract full diversity, repetition codes outperform OSTBCs. The performance gap increases with the increasing number of transmit apertures. Our findings clearly point out that deployment of OSTBCs is not necessary for a FSO IM/DD link.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686821/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","volume":"7","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10348442","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686821/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Do We Really Need OSTBCs for Free-Space Optical Communication with Direct Detection?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Do We Really Need OSTBCs for Free-Space Optical Communication with Direct Detection?","sourcePdf":"4445-tw0811-safari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078677S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686821","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4686824,"authors":[{"name":"Golnaz Farhadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Golnaz","lastName":"Farhadi","id":"37296980200"},{"name":"Norman C.

Closed-form analytical expressions for calculation of the ergodic capacities of these systems are derived. It is shown that systems with nonregenerative fixed gain relays achieve higher ergodic capacities than the corresponding systems with nonregenerative variable gain relays. A modified fixed gain relay, which incorporates the power constraint at the relays, is proposed. It is shown that systems with modified fixed gain relays slightly outperform the corresponding systems with nonregenerative variable gain relays and fixed gain relays at small signal-to-noise ratios, but attain almost the same ergodic capacities as systems with nonregenerative variable gain relays as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. In addition, the ergodic capacity of a hybrid system with both regenerative and nonregenerative relays is studied.

In this case, the JPCOB design is formulated as the problem of minimizing the total transmitted power in the coordinated multi-cell system, subject to a certain quality of service requirement for each user. In this paper, the performance of two JPCOB algorithms based on different beamforming approaches is compared over the coordinated multi-cell system. The first one, obtains local beamformers by means of the well-known virtual uplink-downlink duality. In contrast, the second algorithm implements multi-base beamformers, taking into account match filter equalizers at the receivers. Moreover, realistic system parameters, such as per-base station power constraints or the asynchronous nature of the signals arriving at the receivers, are taken into account. Simulation results show that the algorithm based on multi-base beamforming presents attractive properties, such as an inherent multi-base scheduling technique or a decreasing total transmitted power as the degree of coordination between base stations is increased.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686827.pdf","startPage":"4479","endPage":"4485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordination in a Multi-Cell Multi-Antenna Multi-User W-CDMA System: A Beamforming Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Array signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Power control","Downlink","Quality of service","Matched filters","Equalizers","Scheduling algorithm","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multifrequency antennas","multiuser channels","power control","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell multiantenna multiuser WCDMA system","beamforming approach","joint power control and optimal beamforming algorithm","quality of service","virtual uplink-downlink duality","match filter equalizer","per-base station power constraint","base station"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated multi-cell system, downlink multi-basebeamforming, multi-base scheduling techniques, joint power control and optimal beamforming algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coordination in a Multi-Cell Multi-Antenna Multi-User W-CDMA System: A Beamforming Approach","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4686827/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348448","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordination in a Multi-Cell Multi-Antenna Multi-User W-CDMA System: A Beamforming Approach","sourcePdf":"4479-tw0811-botella.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070028S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686828,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This semi-blind scheme has a low computational complexity, and our simulation results demonstrate that it converges fast to the minimum mean-square-error spatial equalization solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686828/","accessionNumber":"10348449","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Blind Adaptive Spatial Equalization for MIMO Systems with High-Order QAM Signalling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Blind Adaptive Spatial Equalization for MIMO Systems with High-Order QAM Signalling","sourcePdf":"4486-tw0811-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054415S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":4686829,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Xia","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute of Signal & Image Processing, School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xia","id":"38556983700"},{"name":"Yijia Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yijia","lastName":"Fan","id":"37539940800"},{"name":"John Thompson","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute of Signal & Image Processing, School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Thompson","id":"37273630300"},{"name":"H.

The scheme assumes the BS is equipped with multiple antennas and uses zero-forcing beamforming to schedule multiple users on the same time-frequency uplink/downlink channels. The optimal user set that the BS can schedule is the one that maximizes the sum-rate for the communication channel. The computational complexity of finding the optimal user set becomes intractable as the number of users exceeds 20-30. Sub-optimal schemes for maximizing the sum-rate generally require large control overhead. We propose an effective sum-rate performance metric that accounts for the control overhead required by the scheduling method. We also propose a user scheduling method that has both low complexity and low overhead. The complexity and overhead are reduced by adding one user at a time and distributing the computation of the scheduling problem across the users. Each user calculates the sum-rate that would result if they were added to the existing user set using their own channel and knowledge of the channels of existing users that is broadcast by the BS. The user with greatest sum-rate increase is scheduled. We use simulations to show that this approach can achieve significantly higher effective sum rates than previously proposed sub-optimal schemes. We also derive an approximate expression for the expected sum-rate with our distributed scheduling method and demonstrate its accuracy with simulations.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.060466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686832.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.060466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"4508","endPage":"4521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Downlink Scheduling Method for Multi-user Communication with Zero-Forcing Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Downlink Scheduling Method for Multi-user Communication with Zero-Forcing Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686832/","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4686832/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348453","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Downlink Scheduling Method for Multi-user Communication with Zero-Forcing Beamforming","sourcePdf":"4508-tw0811-mundarath.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094917S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4686833,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Bains","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4686816/4686833/4686833-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Bains was born in Trondheim, Norway, 1978.

We consider orthogonal relay in which the relay node cannot transmit and receive simultaneously on the same frequency. As a result, the use of relay node may enhance or degrade the achievable transmission rate depending on the instantaneous channel states between the source and the relay, the relay and the destination as well as the source and the destination. Hence, it is very important to dynamically adjust the resources (subbands) allocated to the relay node so that the relay is used only at the right time according to the instantaneous channel states. Conventional approaches dynamically schedule the usage of the relay node in a centralized manner in which full knowledge of the channel states between any two nodes in the network is required. However, perfect knowledge of the channel states at various nodes is very difficult to obtain. In this paper, we shall propose a resource allocation algorithm, which iteratively allocates resource to the source and relay, and converge to the close-to-optimal allocation. Asymptotic achievable rate of the proposed algorithm is derived. We show that the system achieves significant improvement of the achievable rate compared to the point-to-point baseline system without relay as well as the baseline system with random subband allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686834.pdf","startPage":"4534","endPage":"4540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for OFDMA System with Orthogonal Relay using Rateless Code","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Degradation","Dynamic scheduling","Iterative algorithms","MIMO","Digital relays","Interference","Technology management","Multimedia systems","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","orthogonal relay","rateless code","wireless OFDMA system","relay node","channel states","close-to-optimal allocation","point-to-point baseline system","random subband allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation and interference management, multimedia, networks and systems, cooperative diversity, transmission technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for OFDMA System with Orthogonal Relay using Rateless Code","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4686834/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348455","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for OFDMA System with Orthogonal Relay using Rateless Code","sourcePdf":"4534-tw0811-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087446S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686837,"authors":[{"name":"Chuxiang Li","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4686816/4686837/4686837-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuxiang Li received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2006.

The capacity of halfduplex relay channels has been studied previously but the design of good channel codes for such channels remains a challenging problem. Employing an efficient relay protocol, we transform the half-duplex relay code design problem into a problem of ratecompatible LDPC code design where different code segments experience different SNRs. The density evolution with conventional Gaussian approximation for single user channels, which assumes invariant SNR within one codeword, is not capable of accurately predicting the code performance for this system. Here we develop a density evolution with a modified Gaussian approximation that takes into account the SNR variation in one received codeword as well as the rate-compatibility constraint. We then optimize the code ensemble using a modified differential evolution procedure. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm offers more accurate prediction of code performance in half-duplex relay channels than the conventional methods, and the optimized codes achieve a significant gain over existing codes.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686837.pdf","startPage":"4558","endPage":"4567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC Code Design for Half-Duplex Cooperative Relay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"LDPC Code Design for Half-Duplex Cooperative Relay","volume":"7","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348458","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686837/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC Code Design for Half-Duplex Cooperative Relay","sourcePdf":"4558-tw0811-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071785S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4686839,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Karedal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4686816/4686839/4686839-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Johan Karedal received the M.S. degree in engineering physics in 2002 from Lund University in Sweden.

PAN propagation channels differ from the well-explored propagation channels of wide-area networks due to several reasons: (i) the distances are typically very small, (ii) the antenna arrangements can be quite different, and (iii) the influence from human presence in the environment is different. The current paper presents results of a channel measurement campaign, where measurements are conducted over distances of 1-10 m using several multi-antenna devices, combined to create different PAN scenarios. For each measured Tx-Rx separation, channel realizations are obtained by small spatial movements of the antenna devices, and by rotating the persons holding the devices. From the results, we draw two main conclusions: (i) The small scale amplitude statistics, analyzed as the variations over a small sampling area and frequency subchannels, cannot be described in a satisfactory way using only the Rayleigh or Ricean distribution, rather a mixed distribution, the generalized gamma distribution, is more suitable; (ii) it is advantageous to distinguish between two types of large-scale fading: body shadowing (due to the orientation of the person holding the device) and shadowing due to surrounding objects (lateral movement). We also define and parameterize a complete statistical model for all fading.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686839.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","startPage":"4575","endPage":"4585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Measurement-Based Fading Model for Wireless Personal Area Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Measurement-Based Fading Model for Wireless Personal Area Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686839/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348460","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686839/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Measurement-Based Fading Model for Wireless Personal Area Networks","sourcePdf":"4575-tw0811-karedal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083294S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4686840,"authors":[{"name":"Christian R.

This layered approach is also applicable to an end-to-end data transport over a network where a wireless link is the performance bottleneck. We investigate how to optimally combine the strengths of error- and erasure-correction coding to optimize the system performance with a given resource constraint, or to maximize the resource utilization efficiency subject to a prescribed performance. Our results determine the optimum tradeoff in splitting redundancy between error-correction coding and erasure-correction codes, which depends on the fading statistics and the average signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the wireless channel. For severe fading channels, such as Rayleigh fading channels, the tradeoff leans towards more redundancy on erasure-correction coding across packets, and less so on error-correction coding within each packet. For channels with better fading conditions, more redundancy can be spent on error-correction coding. The analysis has been extended to a limiting case with a large number of packets, and a scenario where only discrete rates are available via a finite number of transmission modes.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","startPage":"4586","endPage":"4595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Joint Erasure- and Error-Correction Coding for Wireless Packet Transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Joint Erasure- and Error-Correction Coding for Wireless Packet Transmissions","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348461","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4686840/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Joint Erasure- and Error-Correction Coding for Wireless Packet Transmissions","sourcePdf":"4586-tw0811-berger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061093S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4686841,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Casari","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4686816/4686841/4686841-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Casari (S'05, M'08) was born in Ferrara, Italy, on August 20th, 1980.

First, we study the impact of MIMO on packet transmission in an ad hoc network setting. Then, following a crossiquestlayer design paradigm, we deploy a distributed access control protocol and characterize its performance, with the aim to improve spatial reuse and convey more information on a single ad hoc link. We also explore the interaction between the Medium Access Control (MAC) and PHY layers, and use this knowledge to implement proper policies for distributed traffic control and robustness against interference.

Optimal decoders require knowledge of the marginal posterior distributions of the transmitted symbols, but their exact computation is not feasible for practical systems. Hence sub-optimal approaches are generally sought. By recasting this problem into the graphical model framework, we investigate here a recently proposed suboptimal approach which relies on a tree-based reparameterization principle. For quasi-static fading channels, the resulting decoder complexity has an order which is at most quadratic in the number of transmit antennas. However, in its standard form, the algorithm often fails to converge, severely restricting its practical usability. We here develop a novel methodology to ensure systematic convergence of the algorithm in this communication scenario at the expense of the introduction of a minimal bias on the computation of the symbol marginal posterior probabilities. This bias is quantified theoretically and its innocuity for the problem at hand is ultimately demonstrated through numerical simulations.

In our study three classes of rank-reduction algorithms are considered, which are derived, respectively, based on the eigen-analysis methods of principal components (PC) and crossspectral metrics (CSMs) as well as on the Taylor polynomial approximation (TPA) approach, which does not depend on the eigen-analysis. In this contribution both the capacity and error performance of a downlink space-division multiple-access (SDMA) system is investigated, when either the full-rank or reduced-rank MPDR-TMP is invoked. From our study and simulation results, it can be shown that the MPDR-TMP scheme is highly efficient for achieving the capacity and for suppressing the multiuser interference (MUI). The reduced-rank techniques can be employed by the MPDR-TMP, so as to reduce its implementation complexity while achieving the near full-rank performance of the full-rank MPDR-TMP.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686846.pdf","startPage":"4646","endPage":"4655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and Error Performance of Reduced-Rank Transmitter Multiuser Preprocessing Based on Minimum Power Distortionless Response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686846/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Error Performance of Reduced-Rank Transmitter Multiuser Preprocessing Based on Minimum Power Distortionless Response","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348467","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686846/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Error Performance of Reduced-Rank Transmitter Multiuser Preprocessing Based on Minimum Power Distortionless Response","sourcePdf":"4646-tw0811-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088471S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4686848,"authors":[{"name":"Duo Zhang","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4686816/4686848/4686848-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Duo Zhang (M'06) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.

This paper investigates the achievable sum capacity of spectrum-sharing CR networks, taking into account of channel multipath profiles, transmit power constraints, as well as the outage probability requirements from primary users holding spectrum licenses. Two transmission formats, narrowband versus ultra-wideband, are compared for adoption in CR networks. Capacity analysis indicates that ultra-wideband CRs are in general more suitable for networks operating over licensed bands, when strict outage requirements are imposed for protecting primary users. On license-free bands, on the other hand, narrowband CRs employing orthogonal channelization offer higher network capacity, while its ultra-wideband counterparts become competitive only when the multipath effect is moderate. In the presence of primary users, the interference temperature constraint limits the narrowband network more than its ultra-wideband counterpart.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10348469","htmlLink":"/document/4686848/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Capacity of Narrowband vs. Ultra-wideband Cognitive Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Capacity of Narrowband vs. Ultra-wideband Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"4670-tw0811-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091635S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4686849,"authors":[{"name":"Wessam Mesbah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4686816/4686849/4686849-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wessam Mesbah (S'08) received the B.

The algorithm is based on two results derived herein: a closed-form solution for the optimal power allocation for a given channel resource allocation; and the fact that the channel resource allocation problem is quasiconvex. The structure of the optimal power allocation reveals that at optimality at most one user acts as a relay, and hence a fraction of the channel resource will be idle. We propose a modified orthogonal AF cooperation scheme that uses the channel resources more efficiently and hence provides a larger achievable rate region.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686849.pdf","startPage":"4681","endPage":"4691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power and Channel Resource Allocation for Two-User Orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686849/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power and Channel Resource Allocation for Two-User Orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348470","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686849/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power and Channel Resource Allocation for Two-User Orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation","sourcePdf":"4681-tw0811-mesbah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087737S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686849","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4686851,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Catrein","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Ericsson GmbH, Herzogenrath, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Catrein","id":"37271895400"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4686851","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon carbide","Matched filters","Interference cancellation","Quality of service","Vectors","Equations","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","matched filters","power control","quality of service","radio receivers","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","linear multiuser receivers","CDMA networks","code division multiple access","successive interference cancellation","matched filter","minimum mean squared error receiver","MMSE","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","quality-of-service requirements","asymptotic large system regime","QoS","linear equations","iterative algorithm","optimum power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matched filter, successive interference cancellation","minimum mean squared error, random spreading sequences","large system regime, standard interference function, large system regime"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with linear multiuser receivers for code division multiple access (CDMA). Mainly three are of practical relevance: the matched filter (MF), the successive interference cancellation (SIC) and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receiver. For the first time, an explicit representation of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) ratio for the linear SIC receiver under general random spreading is given. For the MMSE receiver the SINR is obtained by using the asymptotic large system regime as an accurate approximation. Once the SINR for each receiver type is known, the question arises what quality-of-service (QoS) requirements can be supported by an adequate power assignment. A vector of QoS requirements (gammai) is called feasible, if there exists some power assignment such that the SINR of each user i does not fall short of threshold gammai. It is shown that for each receiver type there exists a componentwise minimal power assignment such that the SINR of each user equals this threshold. This minimal vector may be determined for the MF and SIC receiver by solving a system of linear equations with coefficients explicitly known. For the MMSE receiver in the large system regime an iterative algorithm is derived, which converges to the optimum power allocation.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686851.pdf","startPage":"4700","endPage":"4709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility and Power Control for Linear Multiuser Receivers in CDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686851/","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility and Power Control for Linear Multiuser Receivers in CDMA Networks","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348472","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686851/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility and Power Control for Linear Multiuser Receivers in CDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"4700-tw0811-catrein.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094877S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4686852,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Bansal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4686816/4686852/4686852-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gaurav Bansal received a Bachelor of Technology (B.

The downlink transmission capacity of the CR user is thereby maximized, while the interference introduced to the primary user (PU) remains within a tolerable range. We also propose two suboptimal loading algorithms that are less complex. We also study the effect of a subcarrier nulling mechanism on the performance of the different algorithms under consideration. The performance of the optimal and suboptimal schemes is compared with the performance of the classical power loading algorithms, e.g., water-filling and uniform power but variable rate loading schemes that are used for conventional OFDM-based systems. Presented numerical results show that for a given interference threshold, the proposed optimal scheme allows CR base station (BS) to transmit more power in order to achieve a higher transmission rate than the classical loading algorithms. These results also show that although the proposed suboptimal schemes have certain degradation in performance compared to the optimal scheme, they outperform the classical loading algorithms. We also present numerical results for nulling mechanism.

Time-variance is effectively taken into account exploiting the properties of the discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) sequences, being the bandlimited sequences with maximum energy concentration in time. Turbo codes are used for each transmit antenna, thus the receiver presents an iterative structure also in the single-user case.

The average BER over MIMO fading channel for a given constellation using the MMSE receiver is calculated numerically. The numerical and simulation results match very well. With the statistics as a guideline, we study new design of selection-mode adaptation using a linear dispersion code. A new adaptive parameter, called space-time symbol rate, can be applied due to the use of linear dispersion code. An adaptive algorithm for the selection-mode adaptation is proposed. Based on the proposed algorithm, two adaptive techniques using constellation and space-time symbol rate are studied, respectively. If constellation and space-time symbol rate are considered jointly, more selection modes can be available. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the average transmission rate of selection-mode adaptation can be improved in this case.

These gains are achieved by exploiting the multipath (frequency) and cooperative diversities to combat the fading nature of wireless channels. The challenge is how to design space frequency codes, distributed among randomly located nodes that can exploit the frequency diversity of the wireless broadband channels. In this paper, the design of distributed space-frequency codes (DSFCs) for wireless relay networks is considered. The proposed DSFCs are designed to achieve the frequency and cooperative diversities of the wireless relay channels. The use of DSFCs with the decode-and-forward (DAF) and amplify-and forward (AAF) protocols is considered. The code design criteria to achieve full diversity, based on the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, are derived. For DSFC with the DAF protocol, a two-stage coding scheme, with source node coding and relay nodes coding, is proposed. We derive sufficient conditions for the proposed code structures at the source and relay nodes to achieve full diversity of order NL, where N is the number of relay nodes and L is the number of paths per channel. For the case of DSFC with the AAF protocol, a structure for distributed space-frequency coding is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4686816/04686856.pdf","startPage":"4748","endPage":"4759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Space-Frequency Coding over Broadband Relay Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686856/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Space-Frequency Coding over Broadband Relay Channels","volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10348477","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686856/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Space-Frequency Coding over Broadband Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"4748-tw0811-seddik.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075454S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4686816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4686816","articleId":"4686856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4686871,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail G.

The signals are cross-correlated to obtain the microscopic tissue displacements, which can be directly translated into local strain of the vessel wall. However, (apparent) tissue motion and nonuniform deformation of the vessel wall, due to catheter wiggling, reduce signal correlation and result in invalid strain estimates. Implications of probe motion were studied on the tissue-mimicking phantom. The measured circumferential tissue displacement and level of the speckle decorrelation amounted to 12deg and 0.58, respectively, for the catheter displacement of 456 mum. To compensate for the motion artifacts in IVUS palpography, a novel method based on the feature-based scale-space optical flow (OF), and classical block matching (BM) algorithm, were employed. The computed OF vector and BM displacement fields quantify the amount of local tissue misalignment in consecutive frames. Subsequently, the extracted circumferential displacements are used to realign the signals before strain computation. Motion compensation reduces the RF signal decorrelation and increases the number of valid strain estimates. The advantage of applying the motion correction in IVUS palpography was demonstrated in a midscale validation study on 14 in vivo pullbacks. Both methods substantially increase the number of valid strain estimates in the partial and compounded palpograms.

In this paper, we develop a Fourier-domain approach to full-matrix imaging based on the wavenumber algorithm used in synthetic aperture radar and sonar. The extension to the wavenumber algorithm for full-matrix data is described and the performance of the new algorithm compared with the TFM, which we use as a representative benchmark for the time-domain algorithms. The wavenumber algorithm provides a mathematically rigorous solution to the inverse problem for the assumed forward wave propagation model, whereas the TFM employs heuristic delay-and-sum beamforming. Consequently, the wavenumber algorithm has an improved point-spread function and provides better imagery. However, the major advantage of the wavenumber algorithm is its superior computational performance. For large arrays and images, the wavenumber algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the TFM. On the other hand, the key advantage of the TFM is its flexibility. The wavenumber algorithm requires a regularly sampled linear array, while the TFM can handle arbitrary imaging geometries. The TFM and the wavenumber algorithm are compared using simulated and experimental data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Focusing","Inspection","Synthetic aperture sonar","Time domain analysis","Inverse problems","Mathematical model","Propagation delay","Array signal processing","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic arrays","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic materials testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavenumber algorithm","full-matrix imaging","ultrasonic array","ultrasonic imaging","total focusing method","Fourier-domain approach","synthetic aperture radar","synthetic aperture sonar","time-domain algorithms","forward wave propagation","point-spread function","arbitrary imaging geometries"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Transducers","Ultrasonography","Ultrasonography"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4686858/04686876.pdf","startPage":"2450","endPage":"2462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The wavenumber algorithm for full-matrix imaging using an ultrasonic array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The wavenumber algorithm for full-matrix imaging using an ultrasonic array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686876/","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4686876/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10324754","pubMedId":"19049924","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The wavenumber algorithm for full-matrix imaging using an ultrasonic array","sourcePdf":"t08b2450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101764S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4686858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"4686858","articleId":"4686876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4686883,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Beers","affiliation":["Graduate Program in Acoustics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Christopher Beers and"]},"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Beers","id":"37868870700"},{"name":"Nadine Barrie Smith","affiliation":["Graduate Program in Acoustics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nadine Barrie Smith photographs and biographies not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Nadine Barrie","lastName":"Smith","id":"37265541100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-3010"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1525-8955"}],"articleNumber":"4686883","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/index2.asp"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic transducer arrays","Frequency","Circuit testing","Polymers","Biomedical engineering","Ceramics","Back","Materials testing","Medical tests","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","composite materials","finite element analysis","piezoelectric devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical ultrasonic piezocomposite arrays","piezoelectric composites","medical diagnostic ultrasonic imaging arrays","acoustic impedance","finite element analysis","stiffness discontinuity","secondary wave","receive transduction","electrical loading"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acoustics","Artifacts","Computer-Aided Design","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Transducers","Ultrasonography"]}],"abstract":"Piezoelectric composites are commonly used in medical diagnostic ultrasonic imaging arrays. The performance of the array elements at either end of the array can differ from that of array elements away from the ends. There is some general understanding about the origin of these effects (such as different acoustic impedance), and some standard compensatory designs exist (such as adding unused array elements further on the end than the last used array element). This work seeks to elucidate the origins of these end-element anomalies and to propose corresponding design changes. A commercially produced array with notable end-element anomalies is examined as a case study. Results from experiments and finite element analysis indicate that, in the presence of a stiffness discontinuity within the composite (such as poled elements adjacent to unpoled ones), a secondary wave that propagates laterally through the composite may be generated during the receive transduction. This wave appears to cause the anomalous behavior observed in the signals and metrics of the end elements. Changing the electrical loading of an element and poling the unused, previously unpoled elements are explored as anomalymitigating design alterations. The latter of these 2 initially appears to be the more effective solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-element anomalies in medical ultrasonic piezo-composite arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.959","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4686858/04686883.pdf","startPage":"2509","endPage":"2518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4686883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4686883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"End-element anomalies in medical ultrasonic piezo-composite arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4686883/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324742","pubMedId":"19049931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-element anomalies in medical ultrasonic piezo-composite arrays","sourcePdf":"t08b2509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057452S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4686858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","xplore-issue":"4686858","articleId":"4686883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4687366,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the AAC, the filterbank tool, which is composed of IMDCT, windowing and overlap-add, has the highest computation complexity. In this three steps, IMDCT is the important component. Hence, most published filterbank algorithms focus mainly on the implementation of IMDCT but overlook the relevancy between the steps. This paper proposed a novel architecture of filterbank tool and its hardware implementation. A fast algorithm for IMDCT which contains pre-IFFT, N/4-point IFFT and post-IFFT is employed. In order to improve the efficiency of memory access, windowing and overlap-add operation are combined with post-IFFT, which means no storage elements are required between them and results of post-IFFT will perform windowing and overlap-adding directly. This proposed architecture contains three hardware modules and further improvements are made to each module as well. Totally, 4 multipliers are shared by them in different time. Each module reads data continually from RAM, just like pipeline operation. As a result, this new architecture can improve the memory access efficiency with a speedup of 75% in computation time over the unoptimized one.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security and Identification","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674526/4688331/04688409.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"394","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security and Identification","doi":"10.1109/IWASID.2008.4688409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASID.2008.4688409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4688331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4688409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implementation of filterbank for MPEG-2 AAC on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Computer architecture","Transform coding","Decoding","Very large scale integration","Read-write memory","Pipelines","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filterbank","MPEG-2 AAC","FPGA","audio standard","IMDCT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filterbank","MPEG2-AAC","Implementation","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4688409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An implementation of filterbank for MPEG-2 AAC on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4688409/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408656","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implementation of filterbank for MPEG-2 AAC on FPGA","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11202008-00078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063571S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674526","isNumber":"4688331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674526","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4688331","articleId":"4688409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4688467,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Traditionally, electronic processing was basically limited to tasks like MUX/DEMUX, clock and data recovery and various synchronization loops as well as analog circuitry like modulator drivers or limiting amplifiers. In order to deal with advanced systems and with the need for increased performance at long reach and higher speed, additional signal processing requirements have appeared. Examples are FEC and electronic equalizers (EDC), electronic pre-compensation, differential encoders, clock and carrier recovery, and polarization control. Recent challenges employ pure digital processing, where ADCs and DACs are required, like OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) modulation or MLSE (maximum likelihood sequence estimation) equalizers. In this paper some of these signal processing algorithms are considered in detail and their impact on performance and cost in terms of implementation effort is reviewed.","doi":"10.1109/LEOS.2008.4688662","publicationTitle":"LEOS 2008 -

They guarantee good security performance at low processing and energy costs. However, unlike traditional implementations, they are vulnerable to side channel attacks. Particularly, fault attacks have proved their efficiency in cracking hardware implementation of some robust symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms. In this paper, we develop an FPGA version of the attack proposed by Piret and Quisquater against the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. Through temporal and spatial analyses of the rounds that have been affected by the fault injection process, we adapt the aforementioned attack to our context. The results obtained in this paper can serve to design a more secure FPGA implementation of AES.","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2008.ECP.45","publicationTitle":"2008 New Technologies, Mobility and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 New Technologies, Mobility and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4689053/4689054/04689099.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2008.ECP.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Analysis Attack on an FPGA AES Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fault Analysis Attack on an FPGA AES Implementation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10346539","htmlLink":"/document/4689099/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","conferenceDate":"5-7 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Analysis Attack on an FPGA AES Implementation","confLoc":"Tangier, Morocco","sourcePdf":"41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073125S","chronDate":"5-7 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4689053","isNumber":"4689054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4689053","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4689054","articleId":"4689099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESRGroups France","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4689108,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Schulter","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Schulter","id":"37887863400"},{"name":"Kleber Vieira","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Kleber","lastName":"Vieira","id":"38557454000"},{"name":"Carlos Westphall","firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westphall"},{"name":"Carla Westphall","firstName":"Carla","lastName":"Westphall"},{"name":"Sekkaki Abderrahim","firstName":"Sekkaki","lastName":"Abderrahim","id":"37086260533"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-9532443-0-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-42443547-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4952"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4960"}],"articleNumber":"4689108","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"abstract":"Current intrusion detection technology is limited in providing protection against the intrusions that may violate the security of computational grids.

This problem now consumes over half of the overall verification effort on large designs, and the problem is growing worse. We introduce a new paradigm for using formal analysis, augmented with some on-chip hardware support, to automatically compute error traces that lead to an observed buggy state, thereby greatly simplifying the post-silicon debug problem. Our preliminary simulation experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach: we can \"backspace\" hundreds of cycles from randomly selected states of some sample designs. Our preliminary architectural studies propose some possible implementations and show that the on-chip overhead can be reasonable. We conclude by surveying future research directions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BackSpace: Formal Analysis for Post-Silicon Debug","publicationTitle":"2008 Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/FMCAD.2008.ECP.9","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4689158/4689159/04689168.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FMCAD.2008.ECP.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"BackSpace: Formal Analysis for Post-Silicon Debug","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4689168/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10346602","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BackSpace: Formal Analysis for Post-Silicon Debug","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092855S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4689158","isNumber":"4689159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4689158","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4689159","articleId":"4689168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4689199,"authors":[{"name":"Donald C.

With the advances in RF technology and the huge bandwidth available worldwide in the 57-66 GHz millimeter-wave unlicensed spectrum, mmWave WPANs that can support multigigabit transmission are being developed. However, compared to low-frequency signals (2.4 or 5 GHz), mmWave signals are more fragile; indeed, the propagation losses are significantly higher. In this article we present an mmWave system for supporting uncompressed HD video up to 3 Gb/s. The system includes various efficient error protection and concealment schemes that exploit unequal error resilience properties of uncompressed video. Some of them have been adopted in the emerging 60 GHz WPAN standards such as WirelessHD, ECMA TC48, and IEEE 802.15.3c. Simulations using real uncompressed HD images indicate that the proposed mmWave system can maintain, under poor channel conditions, good average peak-signal-to-noise-ratio and low video quality metric scores.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4689210","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4689193/04689210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4689210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"71","endPage":"78","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A 60 GHz wireless network for enabling uncompressed video communication","volume":"46","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4689210/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10349123","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60 GHz wireless network for enabling uncompressed video communication","sourcePdf":"017SINGH LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083767S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4689193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"4689193","articleId":"4689210","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4689211,"authors":[{"name":"Ting He","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Ting He (cshe@ust.hk) received a B.Eng. degree in computer engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Kowloon, in 2007.

Many users nowadays use Wi-Fi to gain wireless access to the Internet from offices, public libraries, shopping malls, homes, and other places. However, current Wi-Fi deployment is limited to areas where wired LAN is available. Due to its relatively short transmission range in indoor environments (typically several tens of meters), Wi-Fi coverage needs to be extended significantly to full coverage of a certain area. The wireless mesh network (WMN) is a practical and effective solution. In this article we present HomeMesh, an off-the-shelf, simple, and cost-effective WMN for the indoor home environment. HomeMesh is based on simple protocols, implementable in normal notebooks or PCs, and is compatible with existing Wi-Fi APs and clients (i.e., no AP and client modifications). To achieve better end-to-end delay and throughput, HomeMesh dynamically selects its access path based on the ETX metric. We have implemented HomeMesh and conducted proofof- concept experiments in an indoor environment. Our mesh solution is shown to be effective in improving Wi-Fi services.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10349124","htmlLink":"/document/4689211/","displayDocTitle":"HomeMesh: a low-cost indoor wireless mesh for home networking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HomeMesh: a low-cost indoor wireless mesh for home networking","sourcePdf":"018HE LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033624S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4689193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4689193","articleId":"4689211","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4689214,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Andrews","affiliation":["University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jeffrey Andrews [sM'06] (jandrews@ece.utexas.edu) is an associate professor in the ECE Department at the University of Texas (UT) Austin, where he is director of the Wireless Networking and Communications Group.

A MANET is a peer-to-peer network with no preexisting infrastructure. MANETs are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop, relay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. The lack of a MANET capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of many types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and community mesh networks. Information theory, which has been vital for links and centralized networks, has not been successfully applied to decentralized wireless networks. Even if this was accomplished, for such a theory to truly characterize the limits of deployed MANETs it must overcome three key roadblocks. First, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of unbounded delay and reliability. Second, spatial and timescale decompositions have not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of wireless networks. Third, a useful network capacity theory must integrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and feedback. This article describes some of the shifts in thinking that may be needed to overcome these roadblocks and develop a more general theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4689214/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10349126","volume":"46","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rethinking information theory for mobile ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rethinking information theory for mobile ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"021ANDREWS LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08811S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4689193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"4689193","articleId":"4689214","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4689219,"authors":[{"name":"Yiping Xing","affiliation":["JP Morgan Chase"],"bio":{"p":["Yiping Xing (yxing@stevens.edu) received a B.S degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, in 2001, and an M.E. degree from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hobo-ken, New Jersey, in 2004, both in electrical engineering.

Now, it is well understood in the community that security and protection of private user information are a prerequisite for the deployment of the technology. This is so precisely because the benefits of VC systems, with the mission to enhance transportation safety and efficiency, are at stake. Without the integration of strong and practical security and privacy enhancing mechanisms, VC systems can be disrupted or disabled, even by relatively unsophisticated attackers. We address this problem within the SeVeCom project, having developed a security architecture that provides a comprehensive and practical solution. We present our results in a set of two articles in this issue. In this first one, we analyze threats and types of adversaries, identify security and privacy requirements, and present a spectrum of mechanisms to secure VC systems. We provide a solution that can be quickly adopted and deployed. In the second article we present our progress toward the implementation of our architecture and results on the performance of the secure VC system, along with a discussion of upcoming research challenges and our related current results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure vehicular communication systems: design and architecture","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4689252","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4689230/04689252.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4689252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"Secure vehicular communication systems: design and architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4689252/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324639","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure vehicular communication systems: design and architecture","sourcePdf":"022PAPADIMITRATOS LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080145S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4689230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"305","xplore-issue":"4689230","articleId":"4689252","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4689253,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Kargl","affiliation":["Ulm University, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Frank Kargl (frank.kargl@uni-ulm.de) received his doctorate degree in 2003 working on security in mobile ad hoc networks.

It can be seen that studies of vehicular communication protocols in the context of VANETs are typically based on simulation models. This approach has two major prerequisites: First, detailed network simulation of all layers of communication protocols is necessary as provided by a wide variety of tools by the networking community. Secondly, realistic simulation of vehicles' mobility, i.e., an exact modeling of road traffic, is needed to estimate positions and movements of involved components. The contributions of this article are twofold: First, a survey of the evolution of mobility modeling in VANET simulations is provided, outlining the simulation strategies typically used. Secondly, this article investigates how recent advances in bidirectional coupling of road traffic microsimulation and network simulation lead to more realistic results at comparably low computational cost. In conclusion, this article advocates to employ such techniques that are openly available for further studies of new communication protocols and mechanisms in the domain of VANET research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689256/","volume":"46","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4689256/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10324648","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Progressing toward realistic mobility models in VANET simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressing toward realistic mobility models in VANET simulations","sourcePdf":"026SOMMER LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046819S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4689230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4689230","articleId":"4689256","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4689311,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad K.

In this paper, we use the latest scalable H.264 codec (SVC), which provides combined temporal, quality and spatial scalability. At the transmitter, we estimate the decoded video distortion for given channel conditions taking into account the effects of quantization, packet loss and error concealment. The proposed scalable decoder distortion algorithm offers low delay and low complexity. The performance of this method is validated using experimental results. In our proposed system, we use a MIMO system with orthogonal space-time block codes (O-STBC) that provides spatial diversity and guarantees independent transmission of different symbols within the block code. The bandwidth constrained allocation problem considered here is simplified and solved for one O-STBC symbol at a time. Furthermore, we take the advantage of the hierarchical structure of SVC to attain the optimal solution for each group of pictures (GOP) of the video sequence. We incorporate the estimated decoder distortion to optimally select the application layer parameter, i.e., quantization parameter (QP), and physical layer parameters, i.e., channel coding rate and modulation type for wireless video transmission.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2008.2007317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4694844/04689311.pdf","startPage":"1698","endPage":"1707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2008.2007317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4694844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Delay Low-Complexity Bandwidth-Constrained Wireless Video Transmission Using SVC Over MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689311/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Delay Low-Complexity Bandwidth-Constrained Wireless Video Transmission Using SVC Over MIMO Systems","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10360278","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4689311/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Delay Low-Complexity Bandwidth-Constrained Wireless Video Transmission Using SVC Over MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"10tmm08-lkondi-2007317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072417S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4694844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4694844","articleId":"4689311","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4689312,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Sha","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI design, KLAPEM, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4749486/4689312/4689312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin Sha received the B.S. degree in physics and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from the Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","Since finishing his graduate study, he has been an ASIC Design Engineer with the Corporate Research and Development Group, OmniVision Technologies, Inc.

The VLSI implementation of high-speed LDPC decoder remains a big challenge. This paper presents the construction of a new class of implementation-oriented LDPC codes, namely \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">shift-LDPC</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">codes</i>\n. With girth optimization, this kind of codes can perform as well as computer generated random codes. More importantly, the decoder can be efficiently implemented to obtain very high decoding speeds. In addition, more than 50% of message memory can be generally saved over conventional partially parallel decoder architectures. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed techniques with an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design (in 0.18-mum CMOS) for a 8192-bit regular LDPC code, which can achieve 5 Gb/s throughput at 15 iterations.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2002487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2002487","startPage":"262","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4749486/04689312.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Gb/s LDPC Code Design and Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Gb/s LDPC Code Design and Implementation","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10391568","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4689312/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Gb/s LDPC Code Design and Implementation","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi10-jsha-2002487.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054738S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4749486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4749486","articleId":"4689312","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4689314,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-U Lee","affiliation":["Mojix, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4717837/4689314/4689314-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-U Lee (M'05) received the B.Eng. degree in information systems engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computing, both from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From 2005 to 2007, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he developed high-performance hardware designs for wireless communications and mathematical function evaluations.

The methodology provides significant reduction in table size compared to traditional uniform segmentation approaches. The use of hierarchies involving uniform splines and splines with size varying by powers of two is particularly well suited for the coverage of nonlinear regions. The segmentation step is automated and supports user-supplied precision requirements and approximation method. Bit-widths of the coefficients and arithmetic operators are optimized to minimize circuit area and enable a guarantee of 1 unit in the last place (ulp) accuracy at the output. A coefficient transformation technique is also described, which significantly reduces the dynamic ranges of the fixed-point polynomial coefficients.

The control objective is to track a reference trajectory within the air gap without knowledge of the plant parameters. Both full-state feedback and output feedback schemes are developed, the latter being motivated by practical difficulties in measuring velocity of the moving plate. For the full-state feedback scheme, the system is transformed to the parametric strict feedback form, for which adaptive backstepping is performed to achieve asymptotic output tracking. Analogously, the output feedback design involved transformation to the parametric output feedback form, followed by the use of adaptive observer backstepping to achieve asymptotic output tracking. To prevent contact between the movable and fixed electrodes, special barrier functions are employed in Lyapunov synthesis. All closed-loop signals are ensured to be bounded. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the performance of the proposed control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Control of Electrostatic Microactuators With Bidirectional Drive","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2008.2000981","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4787250/04689317.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2008.2000981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4787250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689317/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control of Electrostatic Microactuators With Bidirectional Drive","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4689317/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10477158","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control of Electrostatic Microactuators With Bidirectional Drive","sourcePdf":"tcst-tee-2000981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1218S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4787250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"4787250","articleId":"4689317","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4689318,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan K.

We augment the traditional approach with a flux observer and derive a sixth-order nonlinear model that takes into consideration the error in flux estimation. A high-gain speed observer is included to estimate the speed from field-oriented currents and voltages. The observer design is independent of the feedback controller design. By high-gain-observer theory, we define a virtual speed output for the sixth-order nonlinear model, which can now be used to design a feedback controller whose performance is recovered by the speed observer when the observer gain is chosen high enough. We then focus on the traditional field oriented control (FOC) approach where the flux is regulated to a constant reference and high-gain current controllers are used. By designing a flux regulator to maintain the flux at a constant reference, and a current regulator to regulate the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n-axis current to its command, we derive a third-order nonlinear model that captures the essence of the speed regulation problem.

It enables us to perform rigorous analysis of the closed-loop system under different controllers, and under uncertainties in the rotor and stator resistances and the load torque. In this paper, we emphasize the design of feedback controllers that include integral action. The analysis reveals an important role played by the steady-state product of the flux frequency and the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n-axis current in determining the control properties of the system.

Based on individual readout of avalanche photodiodes (APD) coupled to LYSO/LGSO phoswich detectors, the scanner supports up to 4608 channels in a 16.2 cm diameter, 11.25 cm axial field of view with an isotropic ~ 1.2 mm FWHM intrinsic spatial resolution at the center of the field of view. Custom data acquisition boards preprocess and sample APD signals at 45 MHz and compute in real time crystal identification, energy and timing information of detected events at an average sustained rate of up to 1250 raw counts per second per mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n (10 000 cps/channel). Real time digital signal analysis also filters out events outside the pre-selected energy window with crystal granularity to eliminate Compton events and electronic noise. Retained events are then merged into a single stream through a real-time sorting tree, at which end prompt and delayed coincidences are extracted. A single Firewire link handles both control and data transfers with a host computer. The LabPET features four data recording modes, giving the user the choice to retain data for research or to minimize file size for high coincidence count rate and imaging purposes. The electronic system also supports time synchronized data insertion for flags such as vital signs used in gated image reconstruction. Aside from data acquisition, hardware can generate live energy and discrimination spectra suitable for fast, automatic channel calibration.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2002326","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4696571/04689332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2002326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4696571","startPage":"2546","endPage":"2550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Architecture of the LabPET Small Animal PET Scanner","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"System Architecture of the LabPET Small Animal PET Scanner","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10361718","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4689332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Architecture of the LabPET Small Animal PET Scanner","sourcePdf":"tns-tetrault-2002326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094079S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4696571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4696571","articleId":"4689332","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4689334,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The traditional solution to timing is based on custom application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) designs, whose cost may not be justified in the design of experimental small animal PET scanners. The new generation of PET scanners introduces the idea of continuous sampling of the detected scintillation pulse, replacing event-triggered acquisition front-ends. This approach enables new options to the timing procedure based on digital processing of the sampled pulse signal. This work proposes a time stamping algorithm based on the optically matched filter and compares the potential performance benefits of this approach versus other FIR-based timing algorithms, some of which have been already implemented by different authors. Results show that the coincidence timing resolution may be as low as 1.5 ns without the need of expensive high-speed converters when the proper signal processing is applied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689334/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","volume":"55","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10361719","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4689334/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Digital Timing in Positron Emission Tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Digital Timing in Positron Emission Tomography","sourcePdf":"tns-pguerra-2005896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087033S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4696571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4696571","articleId":"4689334","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4689338,"authors":[{"name":"Gianfranco Fornaro","affiliation":["Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dellE28099Ambiente, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4729687/4689338/4689338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gianfranco Fornaro (M'06) received the Laurea degree (summa cum laude) in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Napoli, Napoli, Italy, in 1992 and 1997, respectively.","Since 1993, he has been with the Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dell'Ambiente, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Napoli, where he is currently a Senior Researcher.

Multiple views are obtained with the current satellite technology via successive passes of a single antenna SAR sensor over the same scene, but next-generation sensor formations are foreseen to acquire multistatic data. Conventional processing, such as the beamforming, or singular values decomposition inversion is based on geometrical derivations and, hence, assumes the accurate phase calibration and the absence of target decorrelation. This paper analyzes the effects of phase miscalibration due to residual uncompensated atmospheric contribution and temporal decorrelation and proposes a 3-D imaging technique based on a linear minimum mean square error approach. The resulting algorithm extends the possibilities of the conventional processing by carrying out an integration of data that accounts for the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">priori</i>\n data correlation properties. Hence, it allows handling of the presence of additional stochastic contributions such as: temporal coherence losses and atmospheric phase miscalibration. Moreover, with reference to future bistatic and multistatic systems, it permits an improved coherent integration of data acquired by simultaneous antenna in repeated passes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689338/","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4689338/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370926","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"LMMSE 3-D SAR Focusing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LMMSE 3-D SAR Focusing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-fornaro-2000633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061889S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4729687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4729687","articleId":"4689338","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4689340,"authors":[{"name":"Begum Demir","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4729684/4689340/4689340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beg\u00fcm Demir (S'06) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic and telecommunication engineering from Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

We discuss modifications of the original reconstruction algorithm proposed by Souyris , which show potential to better reconstruct fully polarimetric data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10370913","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4689341/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Compact Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Modes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Compact Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Modes","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ainsworth-2000925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06988S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4729684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"4729684","articleId":"4689341","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":4689350,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The SC algorithm relies on the concept of atmospheric functions (AFs) which are dependent on atmospheric transmissivity and upwelling and downwelling atmospheric radiances. These AFs are fitted versus the atmospheric water vapor content for operational purposes. In this paper, we present updated fits using MODTRAN 4 radiative transfer code, and we also extend the application of the SC algorithm to the TIR channel of the TM sensor onboard the Landsat-4 platform and the enhanced TM plus sensor onboard the Landsat-7 platform. Five different atmospheric sounding databases have been considered to create simulated data used for retrieving AFs and to test the algorithm.

These will be necessary to accommodate existing 14-V loads as well as efficiently handle new heavy loads at the 42-V net and a traction drive on the HV bus. A low-cost DC-DC converter was proposed for connecting the three voltage nets. It minimizes the number of switches and their associated gate driver components by using two half-bridges and a high-frequency transformer. Another salient feature is that the half bridge on the 42-V bus is also utilized to provide the 14-V bus by operating at duty ratios around an atypical value of 1/3. Moreover, it makes use of the parasitic capacitance of the switches and the transformer leakage inductance for soft switching. The use of half bridges makes the topology well suited for interleaved multiphase modular configurations as a means to increase the power level because the capacitor legs can be shared. This paper presents simulation and experimental results on an interleaved two-phase arrangement rated at 4.5 kW. Also discussed are the benefits of operating with an atypical duty ratio on the transformer and a preferred multiphase configuration to minimize capacitor ripple currents.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712525","startPage":"3035","endPage":"3046","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4712525/04689356.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiphase, Modular, Bidirectional, Triple-Voltage DC\u2013DC Converter for Hybrid and Fuel Cell Vehicle Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4689356/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multiphase, Modular, Bidirectional, Triple-Voltage DC\u2013DC Converter for Hybrid and Fuel Cell Vehicle Power Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370070","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiphase, Modular, Bidirectional, Triple-Voltage DC\u2013DC Converter for Hybrid and Fuel Cell Vehicle Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-su-2005386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07069S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4712525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4712525","articleId":"4689356","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4689357,"authors":[{"name":"Rixin Lai","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4712525/4689357/4689357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rixin Lai (S'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

All major components and subsystems in a converter are considered and the interdependence of all the constraints and design parameters is systematically studied. The key design parameters, including switching frequency, modulation scheme, and passive values, are selected by considering their impacts on loss, harmonics, electromagnetic interference (EMI), control dynamics and stability, and protection. The component selection criteria as well as the physical design procedures are developed from the high-density standpoint. The concept of using the same inductor for harmonic suppression and EMI filtering is introduced in the design. With the proposed methodology, four converter topologies, a back-to-back voltage source converter (BTB-VSC), a nonregenerative three-level boost (Vienna-type) rectifier plus voltage source inverter (NTR-VSI), a back-to-back current source converter (BTB-CSC), and a 12-switch matrix converter, are analyzed and compared for high specific power using SiC devices. The evaluation results show that with the conditions specified in this paper, BTB-VSC and NTR-VSI have considerably lower loss, resulting in higher specific power than BTB-CSC and the matrix converter. The proposed methodology can be applied to other topologies with different comparison metrics and can be a useful tool for high-density topology selection.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4712525/04689357.pdf","startPage":"2665","endPage":"2680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Topology Evaluation Methodology for High-Density Three-Phase PWM AC-AC Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689357/","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Topology Evaluation Methodology for High-Density Three-Phase PWM AC-AC Converters","volume":"23","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370071","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4689357/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Topology Evaluation Methodology for High-Density Three-Phase PWM AC-AC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-lai-2005381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140159S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4712525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4712525","articleId":"4689357","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4689374,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xia","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Idaho, Moscow, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xia","id":"37540005600"},{"name":"Dennis M.

In this paper, we propose a new energy-efficient local metric, which is called the efficient advancement metric (EAM), for sensor networks. EAM considers both the maximum forwarding distance and the packet's successful transmission probability by taking into account the wireless channel condition. This will enable the forwarding node to choose the most energy-efficient relay node in the geographic-informed routing protocol. Theoretically, we show the existence of the unique optimal relay node to maximize EAM over a typical Nakagami-m channel of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA)-based WSN. Furthermore, based on the proposed metric EAM, we present a cross-layer packet-forwarding protocol channel-aware geographic-informed forwarding (CAGIF) by optimally selecting the relay nodes. CAGIF only requires that nodes have the knowledge of their own location information and the location information of the source and destination nodes. Numerical examples are presented to show the characteristics of EAM and the optimal distance. Compared with the previous geographic packet-forwarding schemes in WSNs, CAGIF consumes much lower energy and generates a significantly decreased signal overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4689376/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712969","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cross-Layer Protocol of Channel-Aware Geographic-Informed Forwarding in Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Cross-Layer Protocol of Channel-Aware Geographic-Informed Forwarding in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2010046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074186S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4689376","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4689378,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Chembil Palat","affiliation":["Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, Bridgewater, NJ, USA","Wireless at ViginiaTech Bradley, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4689378/4689378-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ramesh Chembil Palat (M'07) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Government College of Engineering, Kannur, India, which is affiliated with the University of Calicut, Kerala, India, in 1998 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","From 2000 to 2006, he was with the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, as a Graduate Research Assistant with the Mobile and Portable Radio Research Group and the newly formed wireless organization Wireless@VirginiaTech.

Many previous studies have assumed perfect synchronization among cooperating nodes and identically distributed communication links. Such assumptions are rarely valid in practical operating scenarios. This paper develops an analytical framework for computing the average bit error rate (ABER) of a distributed multiple-input-single-output (MISO) space-time-coded system with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation affected by timing synchronization errors. The cooperating nodes use data pulse-shaping filters for transmission over generalized frequency-nonselective fading channels. As an illustrative example, the performance evaluation of a 2 times 1 MISO system that uses distributed orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) is presented, although this approach can be readily extended to analyze distributed transmit diversity with a larger number of cooperating nodes. We show that under certain conditions, a distributed MISO system with time synchronization errors can still outperform a perfectly synchronized single-input-single-output (SISO) system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04689378.pdf","startPage":"2191","endPage":"2200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2010048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2010048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Bit-Error-Rate Analysis of Bandlimited Cooperative OSTBC Networks Under Timing Synchronization Errors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Frequency synchronization","MIMO","Binary phase shift keying","Wireless sensor networks","Distributed computing","Bit error rate","Phase modulation","Filters","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-error-rate analysis","distributed multiple-input-multiple-output system","wireless sensor network","distributed multiple-input-single-output space-time-coded system","binary phase shift keying modulation","data pulse-shaping filters","generalized frequency-nonselective fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","pulse shaping","time synchronization","transmit diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Bit-Error-Rate Analysis of Bandlimited Cooperative OSTBC Networks Under Timing Synchronization Errors","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4689378/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645576","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Bit-Error-Rate Analysis of Bandlimited Cooperative OSTBC Networks Under Timing Synchronization Errors","sourcePdf":"tvt-chembilpalat-2010048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078984S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4689378","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4689379,"authors":[{"name":"Hidehisa Nakayama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Intelligent Systems, Tohoku Institute of Technology, Sendai, Japan","Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4689379/4689379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hidehisa Nakayama (M'05) received the B.E., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in information sciences from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2000, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Assistant Professor with Tohoku Institute of Technology, Sendai.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04689379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","startPage":"2471","endPage":"2481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Anomaly Detection Scheme for AODV-Based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Anomaly Detection Scheme for AODV-Based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645579","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4689379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Anomaly Detection Scheme for AODV-Based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-nakayama-2010049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082341S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4689379","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4689381,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Silva","affiliation":["Escola Superior de Tecnologia, University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4689381/4689381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paulo Silva received the M.Sc. degree from the Technical University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal, in 1999.

As other multicarrier signals, MC-CDMA signals have high envelope fluctuations and a high peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), which leads to amplification difficulties. This is particularly important for the uplink transmission, since an efficient low-cost power amplification is desirable at the mobile terminals (MTs). Moreover, the transmission over time-dispersive channels destroys the orthogonality between spreading codes, which might lead to significant multiple-access interference levels. To reduce the envelope fluctuations of the transmitted signals, while maintaining the spectral efficiency, the MC-CDMA signal associated to each MT is submitted to a clipping device, followed by a frequency-domain filtering operation. However, the nonlinear distortion effects can be high when an MC-CDMA transmitter with reduced envelope fluctuations is intended (e.g., a small clipping level and/or when successive clipping and filtering operations are employed). In this paper, we define an iterative receiver that jointly performs a turbo multiuser detection and the estimation and cancellation of the nonlinear distortion effects. Our performance results show that the proposed receiver structure allows good performances, very close to the linear receiver ones, even for high system load and/or when a PMEPR as low as 1.7 dB is intended for each MT.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04689381.pdf","startPage":"2288","endPage":"2298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2010051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2010051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Turbo Equalization and Multiuser Detection of MC-CDMA Signals With Low Envelope Fluctuations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Signal detection","Fluctuations","Multiaccess communication","Filtering","Nonlinear distortion","OFDM","Telecommunications","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint turbo equalization","multiuser detection","MC-CDMA signals","multicarrier code-division multiple-access","uplink transmission","peak-to-mean envelope power ratio","mobile terminals","time-dispersive channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA)","multiuser detection (MUD)","nonlinear distortion","turbo equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Turbo Equalization and Multiuser Detection of MC-CDMA Signals With Low Envelope Fluctuations","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4689381/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645580","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Turbo Equalization and Multiuser Detection of MC-CDMA Signals With Low Envelope Fluctuations","sourcePdf":"tvt-silva-2010051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081429S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4689381","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4689382,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00c1ssio B.

We extend theoretical results from the literature for zero-forcing equalization in transmultiplexer systems, and derive new conditions for a more general configuration that includes filter-bank based systems with long responses and time-varying filter banks. The time-varying filter banks can be used to model code division multiple access systems with long codes, as well as other practical problems. The results can be applied to both downlink and uplink scenarios, due to the general framework considered for the analysis. The derived relations allow the use of relatively simple equalizers, lead to transmitters using small amount of redundancy, and also allow the transmission through channels with long impulse responses. Experimental results obtained via computer simulations validate the derived expressions. The simulations were carried out for zero-forcing design and also for least-squares and minimum mean squared error designs that use the relations derived for existence of zero-forcing equalizers. The results show that the performance of all equalizers improve if the zero-forcing conditions derived in this paper are followed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Equalizers","Filter bank","Redundancy","Time varying systems","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Transmitters","Computer simulation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","code division multiple access","equalisers","FIR filters","least mean squares methods","time-varying filters","transmultiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying FIR transmultiplexers","minimum redundancy","zero-forcing equalizers","filter-bank based systems","time-varying filter banks","code division multiple access systems","equalizers","least-squares error designs","minimum mean squared error designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiaccess","equalizers","transmultiplexers","zero-force equalizers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2010007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4783546/04689382.pdf","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2010007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Varying FIR Transmultiplexers With Minimum Redundancy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-Varying FIR Transmultiplexers With Minimum Redundancy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689382/","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4689382/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10479022","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Varying FIR Transmultiplexers With Minimum Redundancy","sourcePdf":"tsp-decampos-2010007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116457S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4783546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4783546","articleId":"4689382","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4689384,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4783546/4689384/4689384-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xing Tan received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Shanghai Jiaotong University, China, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville.

The analysis of the PV module electrical model allows one to justify this result and to derive a linear approximation of the MPP locus. Based on that, an MPP tracking strategy is devised which presents high effectiveness, low complexity, and the inherent possibility to compensate for temperature variations by periodically sensing the module open circuit voltage.

The salient-pole rotor machines, where magnetic saturation plays a key role, still pose notable problems in flux, rotor position and speed estimations for motion-sensorless control, especially in the low-speed range (below 30 rpm in general), leading to numerous dedicated state observers. This letter introduces a rather novel (or generalization) concept-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">active</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">flux</i>\n or \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">torque-producing</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">flux</i>\n-and its utilization in all ac drives by employing a unified state observer for motion-sensorless control in a wide speed range. The active-flux concept turns all salient-pole traveling field machines into nonsalient-pole ones. The active-flux vector is aligned to the rotor \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n axis for all synchronous machines and to the rotor-flux vector axis for induction machines. This way, the rotor position and speed observer seems more amenable to a wide speed range, with smaller dynamic errors. This observer, based on the active-flux concept, is pretty much the same for all ac drives. An example of implementation for an interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor with weak permanent magnets and large magnetic saliency that compares very favorably with respect to most signal injection methods, down to 1 rpm and up to 4000 rpm, is provided through digital simulations. Experiments are under way.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4689421/04689434.pdf","startPage":"2612","endPage":"2618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Flux Concept for Motion-Sensorless Unified AC Drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Magnetic flux","Saturation magnetization","Motion control","Stators","Motion estimation","State estimation","Observers","Synchronous machines","Induction machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","drives","machine control","rotors","stators","synchronous machines","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion-sensorless unified AC drives","rotor flux","stator flux","torque control","salient-pole rotor machines","synchronous machines","induction machines","permanent-magnet synchronous motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC motor drives","active flux","estimation","magnetic anisotropy","sensorless control","variable speed drives"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Active Flux Concept for Motion-Sensorless Unified AC Drives","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4689434/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324673","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Flux Concept for Motion-Sensorless Unified AC Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-andreescu-2002394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067667S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4689421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"4689421","articleId":"4689434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4689436,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Iman-Eini","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran","Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory (G2ELab), UMR 5269 ENSIEG, INPG/UJF/CNRS, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4689421/4689436/4689436-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Iman-Eini received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, where he is pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, and also from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG), Grenoble, France.","His research interests include multilevel converters, control of power converters, and power electronics applications in power systems."]},"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Iman-Eini","id":"38277666000"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Schanen","affiliation":["Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory (G2ELab), UMR 5269 ENSIEG, INPG/UJF/CNRS, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4689421/4689436/4689436-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jean-Luc Schanen (SM'04) was born in 1968.

This method ensures that the dc bus capacitor voltages converge to the reference value, even when the loads attached to them are extracting different amounts of power. The proposed method can be used for an arbitrary number of series H-bridges, different voltage levels, and different power levels in unidirectional or bidirectional rectifiers. To reduce the current harmonics and distortion, the input current is programmed to be sinusoidal and in phase with the input voltage; however, it is possible to adjust the input power factor to control both the active and reactive powers. In the proposed approach, both the low frequency (stepped modulation) and high frequency [pulse-width modulation (PWM)] switching methods are utilized to improve the performance of the rectifier. Using theoretical analysis, the acceptable load power limits for a rectifier with N-H-bridge cells are derived. The validity of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4689421/04689436.pdf","startPage":"2428","endPage":"2442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modular Strategy for Control and Voltage Balancing of Cascaded H-Bridge Rectifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689436/","displayDocTitle":"A Modular Strategy for Control and Voltage Balancing of Cascaded H-Bridge Rectifiers","volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324675","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4689436/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modular Strategy for Control and Voltage Balancing of Cascaded H-Bridge Rectifiers","sourcePdf":"tpel-imaneini-2002055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088553S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4689421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"4689421","articleId":"4689436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4689440,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan W.

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating fully automated frequency response measurement capabilities in digital PWM controllers at relatively low additional cost. In particular, it is shown that relatively accurate and smooth frequency response data can be obtained using a Verilog-coded implementation with low tens of thousands of logic gates and about 10 kB of memory. The identification process can be accomplished in several hundred milliseconds and the output voltage can be kept within specified bounds during the entire process.

In this paper, the common-mode (CM) electromagnetic interference noise emission model of the multichannel PFC converter is studied. A balance technique is introduced to reduce CM noise emission. To improve the high-frequency balance, a novel topology with coupled-inductor structure is proposed. Its CM noise model is derived and balance condition for minimizing CM noise is calculated. Effects of phase shift and channel shedding on this solution are also studied. The proposed topology has effectively reduced CM noise under any phase shift and channel shedding conditions. A two-channel PFC converter is built to verify the proposed balance technique. Experimental results show that CM noise can be reduced up to 20 dB between 150 kHz and 7 MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4689421/04689449.pdf","startPage":"2576","endPage":"2584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common-Mode EMI Study and Reduction Technique for the Interleaved Multichannel PFC Converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference","Noise cancellation","Noise reduction","Interleaved codes","Low-frequency noise","Topology","Power factor correction","Switching converters","Filters","Delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference","power factor correction","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved multichannel power factor correction converter","current ripples","the common-mode electromagnetic interference noise emission model","switching power converters","frequency 150 kHz to 7 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference (EMI)","power factor correction (PFC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Common-Mode EMI Study and Reduction Technique for the Interleaved Multichannel PFC Converter","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4689449/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324690","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common-Mode EMI Study and Reduction Technique for the Interleaved Multichannel PFC Converter","sourcePdf":"23tpel05-pkong-2002090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058029S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4689421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4689421","articleId":"4689449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4689461,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Chen","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4689421/4689461/4689461-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), in 2005.","His research interests include single/three-phase inverter, solar energy usage with MPPT, parallel control of three-phase PFC rectifiers/APFs/inverters, grid-connected boost-type inverter and power quality control.

In order to utilize the present infrastructure of the utility grid for power transmission and distribution, grid-connected DC-to-AC inverters are required for alternative energy source power generation. For many of these applications, the input dc voltage is usually below peak voltage of the output and may vary in a wide range. Thus single-stage buck-type inverters may not be adequate, since they have very limited input voltage range and require the input DC voltage to be higher than the peak of the output voltage. For this reason, two-power-stage topologies, cascaded topologies and multilevel topologies are reported for applications where the input voltage is lower than the peak of the output voltage. Typically, one DC-DC power stage is required to boost the DC voltage in addition to an inverter for DC-AC conversion, which yields increased circuitry complexity. One-stage inverters for low DC voltage to high AC voltage conversion have been reported for non-grid-connected inverters based on the topology of a current source inverter. In this paper, the one-cycle control (OCC) method and the pulse width modulation (PWM) method have been proposed for a three-phase boost-type grid-connected inverter. The inverter features a single power stage that converts dc power to grid-connected ac power by injecting three in phase sinusoidal currents into grids, which may reduce power losses and circuit complexity. The input dc voltage is lower than the peak grid voltage and can vary in a wide range, which greatly suits the power conversion from photovoltaic or fuel cells to grid lines. The DC inductance may be kept low because the average DC current is maintained constant in a switching cycle. With the OCC method, the inverter preserves the advantages of simple circuitry, good stability and fast dynamic response and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) function can be conveniently integrated into the control core. Experiments have been performed with a 1.5-kW laboratory prototype that demonstrated the good performance of the inverter and MPPT function.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Phase Boost-Type Grid-Connected Inverter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2003025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4689421/04689461.pdf","startPage":"2301","endPage":"2309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2003025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Three-Phase Boost-Type Grid-Connected Inverter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4689461/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324704","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Phase Boost-Type Grid-Connected Inverter","sourcePdf":"23tpel05-ksmedley-2003025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076205S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4689421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"4689421","articleId":"4689461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4689551,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoying Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5226185/4689551/4689551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoying Zheng received the bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science and engineering from Zhejiang University, P.R.

We first propose a two-timescale algorithm that can recover the optimal time-share values. Most existing algorithms have a component, called global scheduling, which is usually NP-hard. We apply imperfect scheduling and prove that if the imperfect scheduling achieves an approximation ratio rho, then our algorithm produces a suboptimum of the overall problem with the same approximation ratio. By combining the idea of column generation and the two-timescale algorithm, we derive a family of algorithms that allows us to reduce the number of times the global scheduling is needed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10847475","htmlLink":"/document/4689551/","displayDocTitle":"A Class of Cross-Layer Optimization Algorithms for Performance and Complexity Trade-Offs in Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of Cross-Layer Optimization Algorithms for Performance and Complexity Trade-Offs in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2009101393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1133S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5226185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5226185","articleId":"4689551","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4689552,"authors":[{"name":"Ameer A.

In these applications, a set of mobile actor nodes are deployed in addition to sensors in order to collect sensors' data and perform specific tasks in response to detected events/objects. In most scenarios, actors have to respond collectively, which requires interactor coordination. Therefore, maintaining a connected interactor network is critical to the effectiveness of WSANs. However, WSANs often operate unattended in harsh environments where actors can easily fail or get damaged. An actor failure may lead to partitioning the interactor network and thus hinder the fulfillment of the application requirements. In this paper, we present DARA, a distributed actor recovery algorithm, which opts to efficiently restore the connectivity of the interactor network that has been affected by the failure of an actor. Two variants of the algorithm are developed to address 1- and 2-connectivity requirements. The idea is to identify the least set of actors that should be repositioned in order to reestablish a particular level of connectivity. DARA strives to localize the scope of the recovery process and minimize the movement overhead imposed on the involved actors. The effectiveness of DARA is validated through simulation experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2008.246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5175734/04689552.pdf","startPage":"1366","endPage":"1379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2008.246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Movement-Assisted Connectivity Restoration in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4689552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4689552/","displayDocTitle":"Movement-Assisted Connectivity Restoration in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks","volume":"20","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10794792","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4689552/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Movement-Assisted Connectivity Restoration in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2009091366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077042S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5175734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"5175734","articleId":"4689552","onlineDate":"25 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"}]
