In fact, an experimental database of meteorological data (irradiation, temperature) and output electrical generation signals of the PV array (current and voltage) has been used in this study. The inputs of the ANN-PV array are the total solar irradiation and the temperature while the outputs are the current and voltage generated from the PV-array. Firstly, a dataset of 4x365 have been used for training the network. Subsequently, the neural network (MLP) corresponding to PV array is simulated using VHDL language based on the saved weights and bias of the network. Simulation results of the trained MLP-PV array based on Matlab and VHDL are presented. The proposed ANN-VHDL model permits the evaluation of the performance of the PV array using only the environmental factors and involves less computational efforts. It can also be used for predicting the output electrical energy from the PV array and for estimating the I\u2013V characteristic of PV-array. The implementation of the PV-array based on reconfigurable Field Programming Gate Array (FPGA) is suggested in this paper for a real time PV simulator.","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922514","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815197/4922425/04922514.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4922425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based neural network for simulation of photovoltaic array: application for estimating the output power generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4922514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4922514/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based neural network for simulation of photovoltaic array: application for estimating the output power generation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4922514/","conferenceDate":"11-16 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based neural network for simulation of photovoltaic array: application for estimating the output power generation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083837S","chronDate":"11-16 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4815197","isNumber":"4922425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815197","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4922425","articleId":"4922514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4922706,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-ichiro Sato","affiliation":["Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Shin-ichiro Sato","id":"37401066400"},{"name":"Haruki Miyamoto","affiliation":["Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Haruki Miyamoto","id":"37634446300"},{"name":"Mitsuru Imaizumi","affiliation":["Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuru","lastName":"Imaizumi","id":"37272272200"},{"name":"Kazunori Shimazaki","affiliation":["Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Takasaki, Gunma, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazunori Shimazaki","id":"37410565000"},{"name":"Chiharu Morioka","affiliation":["Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Takasaki, Gunma, Japan"],"lastName":"Chiharu Morioka","id":"37373890100"},{"name":"Katsuyasu Kawano","affiliation":["The University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Katsuyasu Kawano","id":"37632676300"},{"name":"Takeshi Ohshima","affiliation":["Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ohshima","id":"37272420400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1640-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1641-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0160-8371"}],"articleNumber":"4922706","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4922706","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Photovoltaic cells","Protons","Gallium arsenide","Electrons","Filtering","Atomic measurements","Optical devices","Analytical models","Aerospace simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922706","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815197/4922425/04922706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4922425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Niel analysis of radiation degradation parameters derived from quantum efficiency of triple-junction space solar cell","abstract":"Degradation modeling of InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction (3J) solar cells due to proton/electron irradiation is performed with the use of a one-dimensional optical device simulator; PC1D.

Data to develop more detailed models have been scarce in the past, but are now increasingly available from multiple sources, therefore it is time to rectify the situation. This paper examines efficiency measurements for a wide range of different inverter products at multiple power levels and input voltages. A model is developed that expresses efficiency as a function of both power and voltage, and it is demonstrated that this model can approximate the efficiency with an appropriate level of accuracy using a small number of parameters. This combination of accuracy and simplicity should facilitate implementation in software and dissemination of model parameters.","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922827","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815197/4922425/04922827.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4922425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond the curves: Modeling the electrical efficiency of photovoltaic inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4922827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4922827/","displayDocTitle":"Beyond the curves: Modeling the electrical efficiency of photovoltaic inverters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4922827/","conferenceDate":"11-16 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond the curves: Modeling the electrical efficiency of photovoltaic inverters","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060904S","chronDate":"11-16 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4815197","isNumber":"4922425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815197","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4922425","articleId":"4922827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4922843,"authors":[{"name":"Takumi Takashima","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Takumi","lastName":"Takashima","id":"37272166300"},{"name":"Junji Yamaguchi","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37089066847"},{"name":"Masayoshi Ishida","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Masayoshi","lastName":"Ishida","id":"37365687100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1640-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1641-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0160-8371"}],"articleNumber":"4922843","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":806},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4922843","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Signal detection","Fault diagnosis","Position measurement","Electronic countermeasures","Voltage","Degradation","Reflectometry","Impedance","Monitoring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922843","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815197/4922425/04922843.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4922425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection by signal response in PV module strings","abstract":"A fault detection and location method in PV module strings was experimentally studied.

The GA broke a subset of the keys using small input texts.","doi":"10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925098","pdfPath":"/iel5/4910763/4925076/04925098.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"121","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4925076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm cryptanalysis of a substitution permutation network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm cryptanalysis of a substitution permutation network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647113","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4925098/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm cryptanalysis of a substitution permutation network","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"CS-0002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079572S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4910763","isNumber":"4925076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910763","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4925076","articleId":"4925098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4925394,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Bi","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Bi","id":"37266610700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-9810-82191-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4925394","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HDD spindle motor system design for data recording with ultrahigh TPI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic noise","Chaos","Drives","Memory","Magnetic heads","Vibrations","Acoustic measurements","Power measurement","Mechanical variables measurement","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data recording","disc drives","hard discs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HDD spindle motor system design","data recording","ultrahigh TPI","electromagnetic structure","mechanical system","power drive","ultrahigh ADD recording","areal data density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spindle motor","drive","acoustic noise","runout","electromagnetics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4925394","abstract":"The performance of spindle motor system is crucial to HDD.

In this work, for the first time, we investigate the use of CSRNs for image registration under affine transformations. In our simulations, we consider binary images with in-plane rotations between plusmn20deg. First, we experiment with a readily available CSRN with generalized multilayer perceptrons (GMLP)s as the basic core. We identify performance criteria for such CSRNs in affine correction. We then propose a modified MLP architecture with multi-layered feedback as the core for a CSRN to improve binary image registration performance. Simulation results show that while both the GMLP network and our modified network are able to achieve localized image registration, our modified architecture is more effective in moving pixels for registration. Finally, we use sub-image processing with our modified MLP architecture, to reduce training time and increase global registration accuracy. Overall, both CSRN architectures show promise for correctly registering a binary image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925649/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10647186","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4925649/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Binary image registration using cellular simultaneous recurrent networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary image registration using cellular simultaneous recurrent networks","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"MS-0017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037964S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911116","isNumber":"4925634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911116","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4925634","articleId":"4925649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4925651,"authors":[{"name":"Nozomi Oka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, 1-1-1, Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8573, Japan"],"firstName":"Nozomi","lastName":"Oka","id":"37638803500"},{"name":"Keisuke Kameyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, 1-1-1, Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8573, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kameyama","id":"37339929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2771-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4925651","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image retrieval","Content based retrieval","Particle swarm optimization","Image databases","Feedback","Information retrieval","Particle measurements","Image matching","Digital images","Search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","image retrieval","particle swarm optimisation","very large databases","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relevance tuning","content-based retrieval","structurally-modeled images","particle swarm optimization","image retrieval","partial image matching","large database image","query image","graph-based image modeling","parameter selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4925651","abstract":"Similarity of images in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a subjective measure varying by the user, and requires tuning according to the user's preference.

In this work, a graph-based image modeling which assigns image regions to labeled nodes and their adjacency to weighted edges is used. Also, the image similarity measure is tuned according to the user's evaluation, by way of parameter selection using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)[1][2].

These surveillance systems have provided the military with the opportunity to monitor battlefields and remote terrain, carryout reconnaissance missions and track targets all from distant ground stations without endangering UAV operators. As with any remote sensing technology there are technical challenges that exist. The problem often arises where large sequences of images containing significant redundancies are being sent to the ground station processing systems and operators. Consequently, the ground station systems can become ldquoweighed downrdquo and operators can become overwhelmed. In addition, the decision making process of detection and recognition algorithms could be rendered ineffective because of the limited visual field of view of individual image frames. In this research image registration software is designed and implemented to integrate a sequence of visual images based on the modified scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. Since computational efficiency is a critical issue in any real-time interactive system, a modified version of the SIFT algorithm is devised and utilized in this work. Implementation and testing results of the developed software are obtained from real data collected from aerial footage and a collaborative camera network.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSVP.2009.4925653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSVP.2009.4925653","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Signal and Vision Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Signal and Vision Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911116/4925634/04925653.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4925634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Image registration for sequence of visual images captured by UAV","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10647190","htmlLink":"/document/4925653/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image registration for sequence of visual images captured by UAV","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"MS-0003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044904S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911116","isNumber":"4925634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911116","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4925634","articleId":"4925653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4925685,"authors":[{"name":"Randy P.

To represent the iris, some researchers fit circles, ellipses or active contours to the boundary pixels of the segmented iris. In order to get an accurate fit, the iris boundary must first be accurately identified. Some segmentation methods operate on a pre-processed gray-scaled image, while others use a thresholded binary edge image. The Hough transform is a popular method used to search for circular or elliptical patterns within the image. Many irises are slightly elliptical, and suffer from eyelid/eyelash occlusion, specular reflections and often the pupil and iris centers are not co-located. Each of these issues can cause a segmentation error. This research uses of a feature saliency algorithm to identify which measurements, used in common iris segmentation methods, jointly contain the most discriminatory information for identify the iris boundary. Once this feature set is identified, an artificial neural network is used to near-optimally combine the segmentation measurements to better localize and identify boundary pixels of the iris. In this approach, no assumption of circularity is assumed when identifying the iris boundary. 322 measurements were tested and eight were found to contain discriminatory information that can assist in identifying the iris boundary. For occluded images, the iris masks created by the neural network were consistently more accurate than the truth mask created using the circular iris boundary assumption.","doi":"10.1109/CIB.2009.4925685","startPage":"46","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Biometrics: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIB.2009.4925685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4925674","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Biometrics: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911411/4925674/04925685.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using artificial neural networks and feature saliency to identify iris measurements that contain the most discriminatory information for iris segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925685/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using artificial neural networks and feature saliency to identify iris measurements that contain the most discriminatory information for iris segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4925685/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10660711","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using artificial neural networks and feature saliency to identify iris measurements that contain the most discriminatory information for iris segmentation","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"BI-0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042399S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911411","isNumber":"4925674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911411","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4925674","articleId":"4925685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4925690,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While biometric systems have been used primarily in limited applications requiring high security tasks like criminal identification and police work, more recently they have been receiving increasing demand for person recognition applications. In spite of all developments in biometrics, there is no study investigating relationships between biometric features in the literature. This study presents a novel intelligent approach analysing the existence of any relationship among fingerprints and face parts. Proposed approach is based on artificial neural networks. Developed system generates the stationary face parts of a person including eyebrows, eyes and nose from only one fingerprint image of the same person without knowing any information about his or her face with the errors among 1.4 % and 4.8 %. The satisfactory results have indicated that there are close realitionships among fingerprints and faces. Improving of the proposed system is still sustained for the purpose of analysing and modelling of this relationship for the future developments in biometrics and security applications.","doi":"10.1109/CIB.2009.4925690","startPage":"77","endPage":"83","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Biometrics: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911411/4925674/04925690.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Biometrics: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIB.2009.4925690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4925674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network based automatic face parts prediction system from only fingerprints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Fingerprint recognition","Biometrics","Feature extraction","Application software","Face recognition","Bioinformatics","Data mining","Spatial databases","Smart cards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","fingerprint identification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","automatic face parts prediction system","biometric systems","person recognition applications","intelligent approach","fingerprint image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["biometrics","face recognition","fingerprint identification","artificial neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network based automatic face parts prediction system from only fingerprints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4925690/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10660716","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network based automatic face parts prediction system from only fingerprints","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"BI-0008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073062S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911411","isNumber":"4925674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911411","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4925674","articleId":"4925690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4925705,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Ashlock","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ashlock","id":"37276503300"},{"name":"Sheridan K.

The complexity of the problem is multifold in application of grafts for regeneration of peripheral nerve injuries, with many variables that affect the regeneration process and thereby the success of regeneration. Here, we develop a Swarm Intelligence based artificial neural network (SWIRL) to predict the outcome of success of a nerve graft, thus providing critical information on the ability of a nerve graft to succeed under certain circumstances. Over 30 independent variables were identified and used as features for training the network and estimation of outcomes. Specific parameters such as the critical regeneration length and the ratio of the actual length to critical length were used in the evaluation and estimation of the success of the nerve grafts. Using the SWIRL, we estimate the success of regeneration of any nerve grafts to approximately 92.59 % accuracy. This system could allow for the estimation of the best possible outcome with a fixed set of variables or identification of best possible combinations with the multitude of options available, aiding researchers to perform experiments and test hypothesis efficiently and ethically.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2009.4925730","startPage":"208","endPage":"214","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2009.4925730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4925694","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4910861/4925694/04925730.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nerve graft selection for peripheral nerve regeneration using neural networks trained by a hybrid ACO/PSO method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925730/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nerve graft selection for peripheral nerve regeneration using neural networks trained by a hybrid ACO/PSO method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4925730/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10647152","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nerve graft selection for peripheral nerve regeneration using neural networks trained by a hybrid ACO/PSO method","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"BC-6009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084165S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4910861","isNumber":"4925694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910861","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4925694","articleId":"4925730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4925738,"authors":[{"name":"Haw-Chang Lan","affiliation":["Dept. of Radiology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Haw-Chang","lastName":"Lan","id":"37641977200"},{"name":"Tsai-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, South Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsai-Rong","lastName":"Chang","id":"37087888607"},{"name":"Wen-Ching Liao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, South Taiwan University, Taiwan","Dept. of of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University"],"firstName":"Wen-Ching","lastName":"Liao","id":"37629402000"},{"name":"Yi-Nun Chung","affiliation":["Dept. of of Electrical Engineering, Dayeh University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Nun","lastName":"Chung","id":"37634170600"},{"name":"Pau-Choo Chung","affiliation":["Dept. of of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University"],"firstName":"Pau-Choo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37287692900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2756-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4925738","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knee","Image segmentation","Neural networks","Level set","Tracking","Trajectory","Pain","Adhesives","Biological tissues","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical MRI","bone","edge detection","feature extraction","image segmentation","medical image processing","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knee MR image segmentation","contextual constrained neural network","level set evolution","patella movement trajectory","knee bending process","knee pain diagnosis","patella tracking","femur image segmentation","patella image segmentation","axial knee MR image","gray level similarities","nonuniform gray intensity","CCNN","SOM","femur contour extraction","patella contour extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4925738","abstract":"Tracking the patella movement trajectory during the bending process of the knee is one essential step to knee pain diagnosis. In order for tracking patella, correct segmentation of the femur and patella from the axial knee MR image is indispensable. But the strong adhesion of the soft tissue around femur and patella, the gray-level similarities of adjacent organs, and the non-uniform gray intensity due to the degradation of the magnetic propagation make the MR image segmentation challenging. In this paper, we proposed a mechanism combining contextual constraint neural network (CCNN) and level set evolution to segment the femur and patella. The segmentation can be divided into two phases. In the first phase SOM and CCNN are applied to extract initial contours of the femur and patella. Consequently in the second phase, modified level set evolution is performed, with the extracted contours as the initial zero level set contour, to accomplish the segmentation of the femur and patella. Our experimental results show that the femur and patella can be correctly segmented for tracking patella movement.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2009.4925738","pdfPath":"/iel5/4910861/4925694/04925738.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"277","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2009.4925738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4925694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knee MR image segmentation combining contextual constrained neural network and level set evolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Knee MR image segmentation combining contextual constrained neural network and level set evolution","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647160","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4925738/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knee MR image segmentation combining contextual constrained neural network and level set evolution","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"BC-6047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058278S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4910861","isNumber":"4925694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910861","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4925694","articleId":"4925738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4925824,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Constantinescu","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"p":["Cristian Constantinescu, PhD","Advanced Micro Devices","2950 E Harmony Road","Fort Collins, Colorado 80528 USA","e-mail: cristian.constantinescu@amd.com","Cristian Constantinescu is a senior member of the technical staff with Advanced Micro Devices.

However, less attention has been given to the intermittent faults. Field collected data and failure analysis results presented in this paper clearly show intermittent faults are a major source of errors in modern integrated circuits. The root cause for these faults ranges from manufacturing residuals to oxide breakdown. Burstiness and high error rates are specific manifestations of the intermittent faults. They may be activated and deactivated by voltage, frequency, and operating temperature variations. The aggressive scaling of semiconductor devices and the higher circuit complexity are expected to increase the likelihood of occurrence of the intermittent faults, despite the extensive use of fault avoidance techniques. Herein we discuss the effectiveness of several fault tolerant approaches, taking into consideration the specifics of the errors generated by intermittent faults. Several solutions, previously proposed for handling particle induced soft errors, are exclusively based on software and too slow for handling large bursts of errors. As a result, hardware implemented fault tolerant techniques, such as error detecting and correcting codes, self checking, and hardware implemented instruction retry, are necessary for mitigating the impact of the intermittent faults, both in the case of microprocessors, and other complex integrated circuits.","doi":"10.1109/RAMS.2008.4925824","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906861/4925744/04925824.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.2008.4925824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4925744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4925824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intermittent faults and effects on reliability of integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4925824/","displayDocTitle":"Intermittent faults and effects on reliability of integrated circuits","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4925824/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"28-31 Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10646942","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intermittent faults and effects on reliability of integrated circuits","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"13A-1.10709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054711S","chronDate":"28-31 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4906861","isNumber":"4925744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906861","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4925744","articleId":"4925824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4926120,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Jin Yoo","affiliation":["Engineering Research Institute, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Jin","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37290947000"},{"name":"Jin Bae Park","affiliation":["Engineering Research Institute, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Bae","lastName":"Park","id":"37281003900"},{"name":"Yoon Ho Choi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Kyonggi University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon Ho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277377400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4926120","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"This brief proposes a simple control approach for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown time delays in strict-feedback form. That is, the dynamic surface control technique, which can solve the ldquoexplosion of complexityrdquo problem in the backstepping design procedure, is extended to nonlinear systems with unknown time delays. The unknown time-delay effects are removed by using appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, and the uncertain nonlinear terms generated by this procedure as well as model uncertainties are approximated by the function approximation technique using neural networks. In addition, the bounds of external disturbances are estimated by the adaptive technique. From the Lyapunov stability theorem, we prove that all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly bounded.

GGAP is a resource-allocating network (RAN) algorithm, which means that a created network unit that consistently makes little contribution to the network's performance can be removed during the training. GGAP states a formula for computing the significance of the network units, which requires a d-fold numerical integration for arbitrary probability density function \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n(\n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</b>\n) of the input data \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</b>\n (\n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</b>\n isin \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</b>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n) .

The board-level links represent a highly integrated packaging approach based on a novel parallel optical module, or Optomodule, with 16 transmitter and 16 receiver channels. Optomodules with 16 Tx+16 Rx channels have been assembled and fully characterized, with transmitters operating at data rates up to 20 Gb/s for a 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\n-1 PRBS pattern. Receivers characterized as fiber-coupled 16-channel transmitter-to-receiver links operated error-free up to 15 Gb/s, providing a 240 Gb/s aggregate bidirectional data rate. The low-profile Optomodule is directly surface mounted to a circuit board using convention ball grid array (BGA) solder process. Optical coupling to a dense array of polymer waveguides fabricated on the PCB is facilitated by turning mirrors and lens arrays integrated into the optical PCB. A complete optical link between two Optomodules interconnected through 32 polymer waveguides has been demonstrated with each unidirectional link operating at 10 Gb/s achieving a 160 Gb/s bidirectional data rate. The full module-to-module link provides the fastest, widest, and most integrated multimode optical bus demonstrated to date.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/4982886/04926123.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2009.2014877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2009.2014877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"160 Gb/s Bidirectional Polymer-Waveguide Board-Level Optical Interconnects Using CMOS-Based Transceivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical polymers","Optical interconnections","Transceivers","Optical waveguides","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical arrays","Integrated optics","Printed circuits","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball grid arrays","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit packaging","integrated optics","optical interconnections","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters","optical waveguides","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional polymer-waveguide board-level optical interconnects","CMOS-based transceiver","parallel optical interconnects","chip-to-chip data transfer","printed circuit board","integrated packaging","parallel optical module","Optomodule","transmitter chanel","receiver channel","ball grid array","solder process","optical coupling","optical PCB","optical link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) analog integrated circuits","integrated optoelectronics","optical planar waveguides","optical receivers","optical transmitters","optoelectronic packaging","parallel optical interconnections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"160 Gb/s Bidirectional Polymer-Waveguide Board-Level Optical Interconnects Using CMOS-Based Transceivers","volume":"32","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4926123/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10667174","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"160 Gb/s Bidirectional Polymer-Waveguide Board-Level Optical Interconnects Using CMOS-Based Transceivers","sourcePdf":"tadvp-doany-2014877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10183S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4982886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4982886","articleId":"4926123","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4926128,"authors":[{"name":"Anamarija Juhas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Anamarija","lastName":"Juhas","id":"37643720300"},{"name":"Ladislav A.

The proposal enables a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) to use vector in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) modulation to generate predistorted complex electronic fields. The basic theory of coordinate transformation and the CORDIC algorithm are explained in detail. The expected dispersion compensation performance for 40-Gb/s differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) is evaluated by numerical simulations. The required number of iterations of the CORDIC algorithm and its impact on signal quality are also clarified. Simulation shows that only seven iterations are required to achieve signal quality sufficient for predistortion transmission. A practical size of 6.9-M gates is estimated to be sufficient for the large scale integration (LSI) implementation for 40-Gb/s DQPSK systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5170198/04926140.pdf","startPage":"3607","endPage":"3613","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2022847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2022847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic Predistortion by Polar Coordinate Transformation Using the CORDIC Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Optical modulation","Optical transmitters","Optical signal processing","Optical fiber communication","Optical filters","Optical receivers","Optical interferometry","Signal processing algorithms","Optical fiber dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","quadrature phase shift keying","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic predistortion","polar coordinate transformation","CORDIC algorithm","electronic predistorting transmitter","dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator","in-phase/quadrature-phase modulation","complex electronic field","expected dispersion compensation performance","differential quadrature phase-shift keying","numerical simulation","signal quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fiber dispersion","optical modulation","optical transmitters","signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Predistortion by Polar Coordinate Transformation Using the CORDIC Algorithm","volume":"27","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/4926140/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10800553","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic Predistortion by Polar Coordinate Transformation Using the CORDIC Algorithm","sourcePdf":"jlt-sugihara-2022847.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073506S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5170198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","xplore-issue":"5170198","articleId":"4926140","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4926145,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-Shi Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xue-Shi","lastName":"Li","id":"37406906100"},{"name":"Fan Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37630051800"},{"name":"Bin-Jie Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin-Jie","lastName":"Hu","id":"37401488200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4926145","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Performance analysis","Plasma simulation","Dielectrics","Frequency","Plasma density","Electrons","Permittivity","Plasma materials processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD analysis","antenna radiation performance","cylinder plasma antenna","finite-difference time-domain method","operating frequency","dielectric tube permittivity","antenna radiation pattern","antenna radiation efficiency","maximal radiation gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cylinder plasma antenna","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","radiation efficiency","radiation patterns"]}],"abstract":"A cylinder plasma antenna coated with a dielectric tube is analyzed by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

However, it is difficult to consider a straightforward integration of tasks described by unilateral constraints in such frameworks. Indeed, unilateral constraints exhibit irregularities that prevent the insertion of unilateral tasks at any priority level, other than the lowest, of a hierarchy. In this paper, we present an original method to generalize the hierarchy-based control schemes to account for unilateral constraints at any priority level. We develop our method first for task sequencing using only the kinematics description; then, we expand it to the task description, using the operational space formulation. The method applies in robotics and computer graphics animation. Its practical implementation is exemplified by realizing a real-manipulator visual servoing task and a humanoid avatar reaching task; both experiments are achieved under the unilateral constraints of joint limits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926146/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10713517","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4926146/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach to Integrate Unilateral Constraints in the Stack of Tasks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach to Integrate Unilateral Constraints in the Stack of Tasks","sourcePdf":"tro-mansard-2020345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161762S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5068831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"5068831","articleId":"4926146","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4926150,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Schneeberger","affiliation":["Levitronix GmbH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5337733/4926150/4926150-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Schneeberger (S'06) was born in Olten, Switzerland, in 1977.

However, in previous studies, only static obstacles in the workspace were considered. In this paper, a neural-network-based approach is proposed for a multirobot system with moving obstacles. A biologically inspired neural-network-based intelligent planner is designed for the coordination of MASs. A landscape of the neural activities for all neurons of a CHA agent contains information about the agent's local goal and moving obstacles. The proposed approach is able to plan the paths for multiple robots while avoiding moving obstacles. The proposed approach is simulated using both Matlab and Vortex. The Vortex module executes control commands from the control system module, and provides the outputs describing the vehicle state and terrain information, which are, in turn, used in the control module to produce the control commands. Simulation results show that the developed intelligent planner of the CHA framework can control a large complex system so that coordination among agents can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2020789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5068840/04926151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2020789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068840","startPage":"410","endPage":"419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Path Planning for a Multirobot System With Moving Obstacles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Path Planning for a Multirobot System With Moving Obstacles","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10714115","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4926151/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-Network-Based Path Planning for a Multirobot System With Moving Obstacles","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-li-2020789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05703S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5068840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5068840","articleId":"4926151","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4926155,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrez Souden","affiliation":["INRS EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehrez","lastName":"Souden","id":"37294213100"},{"name":"Sofi\u00c8ne Affes","affiliation":["INRS EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofi\u00c8ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Jacob Benesty","affiliation":["INRS EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Benesty","id":"37274630700"},{"name":"Rim Bahroun","affiliation":["INRS EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Rim","lastName":"Bahroun","id":"37643722500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4926155","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1062},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Robustness","Wireless communication","Scattering","Frequency conversion","Signal processing","Jacobian matrices","Fourier transforms","Sampling methods","Taylor series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","radio links","series (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust Doppler spread estimation","residual carrier frequency offset","high data-rate transmission system","mobile velocity estimation","optimal adaptive processing","wireless link","CFO","channel cross-correlation","monochromatic plane wave","Taylor series expansion","two-ray spectrum approximate model","closed-form estimator","isotropic scattering","channel power spectrum density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset","Doppler spread","Doppler spread factor","maximum Doppler frequency","two-ray spectrum approximation"]}],"abstract":"In high data-rate transmission systems, accurate Doppler spread estimation is a critical task for not only mobile velocity estimation, but also for optimal adaptive processing. It is known that the residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) which is inherent to the asynchrony between the communicating ends in a wireless link has a detrimental effect on the Doppler spread estimation. In this correspondence, we propose a new simple and accurate approach that copes with this issue by explicitly taking the CFO into account when estimating the Doppler spread. This new approach stems from the fact that the cross-correlation of the channel is a weighted summation of monochromatic plane waves (or an inverse Fourier transform of its power spectral density). It turns out that these plane waves are locally (as compared to the sampling rate) distributed around a main frequency which is nothing but the CFO. Using this property, we base our analysis on Taylor series expansions in addition to an observation temporal aperture to develop a two-ray spectrum approximate model for the Doppler spread estimation. We find that the Doppler spread is half of the frequency spacing between both rays which are located symmetrically around the CFO. Finally, we deduce new closed-form estimators for the Doppler spread and also for the CFO. These estimators are accurate and practical in environments with isotropic scattering where the channel power spectrum density (PSD) is symmetric. Simulations are provided to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method and its robustness to the CFO.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2022859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal

With the predictive control technique, the duty ratio in each switching cycle is usually calculated and predicted based on the status in the previous switching cycles. Therefore, at least a one-switching-cycle time delay usually exists in predictivPe control, which significantly degrades the control performance of digital controlled switching dc-dc converters. To eliminate this time delay and to improve the control performance, an improved DPV (IDPV) predictive control technique is then proposed and studied. The control laws of DPV and IDPV with different pulsewidth modulations are derived, and their stabilities are analyzed. A simple digital slope compensation method is proposed to eliminate the subharmonic oscillation of DPV and IDPV control laws. The steady-state and transient performances of DPV and IDPV controlled buck converters are investigated by simulation and experiment. The comparison studies among DPV, IDPV, and digital peak current (DPC) control show that the transient performances of IDPV and DPV are much better than that of DPC and that IDPV is better than DPV.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04926160.pdf","startPage":"3222","endPage":"3229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2022068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2022068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Digital Peak Voltage Predictive Control for Switching DC\u2013DC Converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive control","Switching converters","DC-DC power converters","Delay effects","Digital control","Degradation","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Stability analysis","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","digital control","electric current control","predictive control","switching convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital peak voltage","predictive control","switching DC-DC converters","duty ratio","digital slope compensation","digital peak current control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital control","digital slope compensation (DSC)","peak voltage control","predictive control","switching dc\u2013dc converters","$V^{2}$ control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Digital Peak Voltage Predictive Control for Switching DC\u2013DC Converters","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4926160/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793132","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Digital Peak Voltage Predictive Control for Switching DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-xu-2022068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062303S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926160","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4926164,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of the aforementioned control scheme, a three-phase four-wire three-level NPC compensator system is taken as an example.

The study focuses on the energy-saving, energy-efficiency, and dimming characteristics of magnetic-ballast-driven HID lamp systems that are suitable for public lighting networks. A central energy-saving unit that can change the input mains voltage of 220 V to a variable voltage within the range from 220 to 170 V is used to control a large lighting network. This central dimming unit offers a new freedom for users to use lighting energy when and where it is needed and to an appropriate power level. Lamp characteristics under full and reduced voltage operation for six types of HID lamps have been measured. Six large-scaled networks of ballast-lamp sets have been set up and dimmed with a central energy-saving unit with a rated power of 13.2 kVA per phase. The full load current under test was set at about 40 A per phase. The loss of the energy-saving unit on a per-lamp-set basis was measured at different voltage levels. It is found that the energy-saving unit can reduce overall system power at least 40% without causing lamp flickering. Through the controllable voltage range, there is no obvious change in color temperature. The lamp power and light output decrease almost linearly with input voltage within the range from 170 to 220 V, and the power loss of the energy-saving unit is less than 2.4% of the full power in all tests. For these large-scaled lighting networks, it is envisaged that 25%-35% of energy saving can be achieved in large public lighting applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2022089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04926166.pdf","startPage":"3069","endPage":"3078","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2022089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Saving of Large-Scale High-Intensity-Discharge Lamp Lighting Networks Using a Central Reactive Power Control System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy Saving of Large-Scale High-Intensity-Discharge Lamp Lighting Networks Using a Central Reactive Power Control System","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4926166/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793133","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Saving of Large-Scale High-Intensity-Discharge Lamp Lighting Networks Using a Central Reactive Power Control System","sourcePdf":"tie-hui-2022089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059506S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926166","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4926167,"authors":[{"name":"Lung-Sheng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/4926167/4926167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lung-Sheng Yang was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1967.

This paper proposes transformerless dc-dc converters to achieve high step-up voltage gain without an extremely high duty ratio. In the proposed converters, two inductors with the same level of inductance are charged in parallel during the switch-on period and are discharged in series during the switch-off period. The structures of the proposed converters are very simple. Only one power stage is used. Moreover, the steady-state analyses of voltage gains and boundary operating conditions are discussed in detail. Finally, a prototype circuit is implemented in the laboratory to verify the performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformerless DC\u2013DC Converters With High Step-Up Voltage Gain","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2022512","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04926167.pdf","startPage":"3144","endPage":"3152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2022512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Transformerless DC\u2013DC Converters With High Step-Up Voltage Gain","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4926167/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793140","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformerless DC\u2013DC Converters With High Step-Up Voltage Gain","sourcePdf":"tie-yang-2022512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090426S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"427","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926167","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4926170,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Lucia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, the Aragon Institute of Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/4926170/4926170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00d3scar Luc\u00eda (S'04) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 2006.

The variable load that is inherent to this application requires the use of a reliable and load-adaptive control algorithm. In addition, a wide output power range is required to get a satisfactory user performance. In this paper, a control algorithm to cover the variety of loads and the output power range is proposed. The main design criteria are efficiency, power balance, acoustic noise, flicker emissions, and user performance. As a result of the analysis, frequency limit and power level limit algorithms are proposed based on square wave and pulse density modulations. These have been implemented in a field-programmable gate array, including output power feedback and mains-voltage zero-cross-detection circuitry. An experimental verification has been performed using a commercial induction heating inverter. This provides a convenient experimental test bench to analyze the viability of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04926170.pdf","startPage":"3106","endPage":"3116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2022516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2022516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-Adaptive Control Algorithm of Half-Bridge Series Resonant Inverter for Domestic Induction Heating","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature control","Resonant inverters","Power generation","Algorithm design and analysis","Pulse modulation","Current supplies","Inductors","Acoustic noise","Frequency","Acoustic pulses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","domestic appliances","induction heating","load regulation","machine control","resonant invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load-adaptive control algorithm","half-bridge series resonant inverter","domestic induction heating","domestic induction cooker","medium-frequency current","acoustic noise","flicker emission","power level limit algorithm","field-programmable gate array","output power feedback","voltage zero-cross-detection circuitry","frequency 20 kHz to 100 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital control","home appliances","induction heating","pulsewidth modulation","resonant power conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Load-Adaptive Control Algorithm of Half-Bridge Series Resonant Inverter for Domestic Induction Heating","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4926170/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793135","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-Adaptive Control Algorithm of Half-Bridge Series Resonant Inverter for Domestic Induction Heating","sourcePdf":"tie-lucia-2022516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087637S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926170","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4926172,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Castilla","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/4926172/4926172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miguel Castilla received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, in 1988, 1995, and 1998, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been an Associate Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, where he currently teaches courses on analog circuits and power electronics.

The system consists of a standard microprocessor and a hardware accelerator for Gaussian mixture model (GMM) emission probability calculation implemented on a field-programmable gate array. The GMM accelerator is optimized for timing performance by exploiting data parallelism. In order to avoid large memory requirement, the accelerator adopts a double buffering scheme for accessing the acoustic parameters with no assumption made on the access pattern of these parameters.

The shunt active filter, realized by a current-controlled inverter, has been used to compensate a nonlinear current load by receiving its reference from a neural adaptive notch filter. This is a recursive notch filter for the fundamental grid frequency (50 Hz) and is based on the use of a linear adaptive neuron (ADALINE). The filter's parameters are made adaptive with respect to the grid frequency fluctuations. A phase-locked loop system is used to extract the fundamental component from the coupling point voltage and to estimate the actual grid frequency. The current control of the inverter has been performed by a multiresonant controller. The estimated grid frequency is fed to the neural adaptive filter and to the multiresonant controller. In this way, the inverter creates a current equal in amplitude and opposite in sign to the load harmonic current, thus producing an almost sinusoidal grid current. An automatic tuning of the multiresonant controller is implemented, which recognizes the largest three harmonics of the load current to be compensated by the APF. The stability analysis of the proposed control system is shown. The methodology has been applied in numerical simulations and experimentally to a properly devised test setup, also in comparison with the classic sinusoidal current control based on the P-Q theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","volume":"56","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10793141","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4926181/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Current Harmonic Compensation by a Single-Phase Shunt Active Power Filter Controlled by Adaptive Neural Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Harmonic Compensation by a Single-Phase Shunt Active Power Filter Controlled by Adaptive Neural Filtering","sourcePdf":"tie-pucci-2022070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072321S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926181","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4926182,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Sathyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA","Chrysler Corporation, Detroit, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/4926182/4926182-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anand Sathyan (S'04) received the B.S. degree (with distinction) in electrical engineering from Amrita Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, India, in 1998, the M.S. degree (with distinction) in electrical engineering from Coimbatore Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.","From August 2001 to August 2004, he was a Faculty Member with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Amrita Institute of Technology.

Residential and commercial appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioning systems use conventional motor drive technology. The machines found in these applications are characterized by low efficiency and high maintenance. A brushless dc (BLDC) motor drive is characterized by higher efficiency, lower maintenance, and higher cost. In a market driven by profit margins, the appliance industry is reluctant to replace the conventional motor drives with the advanced motor drives (BLDC) due to their higher cost. Therefore, it is necessary to have a low-cost but effective BLDC motor controller. This paper lays the groundwork for the development of a new low-cost IC for control of BLDC motors. A simple novel digital pulsewidth-modulation control has been implemented for a trapezoidal BLDC motor drive system. Due to the simplistic nature of this control, it has the potential to be implemented in a low-cost application-specific integrated circuit. The novel controller is modeled and verified using simulations. Experimental verification is carried out using field-programmable gate arrays to validate the claims presented.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2022067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04926182.pdf","startPage":"3040","endPage":"3049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2022067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based Novel Digital PWM Control Scheme for BLDC Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926182/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based Novel Digital PWM Control Scheme for BLDC Motor Drives","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793136","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4926182/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based Novel Digital PWM Control Scheme for BLDC Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-krishnamurthy-2022067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06399S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926182","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4926184,"authors":[{"name":"Zhilei Yao","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","School of Electrical Engineering, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/4926184/4926184-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhilei Yao was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1981.

Hysteresis current control is used in the DBFBI. All switches and diodes operate at each half line cycle, and the freewheeling current flows through the independent freewheeling diodes instead of the body diodes of the switches, so the efficiency can be increased potentially. As the shoot-through problem does not exist in the DBFBI, dead time between the switches need not be set.

The various features of the original MMCCC circuit are best suited for a multibus system in future plug-in hybrid or fuel-cell-powered vehicles' drive train. The original MMCCC is capable of bidirectional power transfer using multilevel modular structure with capacitor-clamped topology. It has a nonisolated structure, and it offers very high efficiency even at partial loads. This circuit was modified to integrate single or multiple high-frequency transformers by using the intermediate voltage nodes of the converter. On the other hand, a special formation of the MMCCC can exhibit dc outputs offering limited isolation without using any isolation transformer. This modified version can produce a high conversion ratio from a limited number of components and has several useful applications in providing power to multiple low-voltage loads in a hybrid or electric automobile. This paper will investigate the origin of generating ac outputs from the MMCCC and shows how the transformer-free version can be modified to create limited isolation from the circuit. In addition, this paper will compare various modified forms of the MMCCC topology with existing dc-dc converter circuits from compactness and component utilization perspectives.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2022074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2022074","startPage":"3079","endPage":"3095","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04926186.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Electric Vehicle Power Management Solutions Based on Isolated and Nonisolated Configurations of Multilevel Modular Capacitor-Clamped Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Electric Vehicle Power Management Solutions Based on Isolated and Nonisolated Configurations of Multilevel Modular Capacitor-Clamped Converter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","volume":"56","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4926186/","accessionNumber":"10793138","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926186/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Electric Vehicle Power Management Solutions Based on Isolated and Nonisolated Configurations of Multilevel Modular Capacitor-Clamped Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-khan-2022074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080369S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926186","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4926188,"authors":[{"name":"F\u00c9lix Moreno","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Departamento de Autom\u00e1tica, Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica e Inform\u00e1tica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/4926188/4926188-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["F\u00e9lix Moreno was born in Valladolid, Spain, in 1959.

One of the most important features of TNNs is their learning ability. Weight modification and architecture reconfiguration can be carried out at run-time. Our system performs objects identification by the interpretation of characteristics elements of their shapes. This is achieved by interconnecting several specialized TNNs. The results of several tests in different conditions are reported in this paper. The system accurately detects a test shape in most of the experiments performed. This paper also contains a detailed description of the system architecture and the processing steps. In order to validate the research, the system has been implemented and configured as a perceptron network with back-propagation learning, choosing as reference application the recognition of shapes.

The resultant impedance vector defined by the capacitor voltage and current gives enough information to estimate the condition of the capacitor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4926189/","accessionNumber":"10793142","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Offline Technique for Evaluating the Condition of Aluminum\u2013Electrolytic\u2013Capacitors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Offline Technique for Evaluating the Condition of Aluminum\u2013Electrolytic\u2013Capacitors","sourcePdf":"tie-amaral-2022077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094393S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4926189","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4926190,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5410131/4926190/4926190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunhua Liu (S'05\u2013M'10) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, in 2009.","He currently serves as a Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong.

For the wind power generation branch, a new doubly excited permanent-magnet brushless machine is used to capture the maximum wind power by using online flux control. For the PV power generation branch, a single-ended primary inductance converter is adopted to harness the maximum solar power by tuning the duty cycle.

We propose to account for class separability by means of controlling the balance tuned by a smoothness parameter between the prior and the likelihood terms in the posterior energy function. A generally applicable procedure estimates the optimal smoothness parameter, based on local energy balance analysis. The study shows how the optimal value of the smoothness parameter depends quantitatively and monotonically upon the class separability and the scale factor. Effects are studied on an image synthesized from an agricultural scene with field boundary subpixels. We varied systematically the class separability, the scale factor, and the smoothness parameter values. The accuracy of the resulting land-cover-map image is assessed by means of the kappa statistic at the fine-resolution scale and the class area proportion at the coarse-resolution scale. Performance is compared with a hard and a soft classification of the coarse-resolution image. We demonstrate that an optimal value of the smoothness parameter exists for each combination of scale factor and class separability. This allows us to reach a high classification accuracy (kappa = 0.85) even for poorly separable classes, i.e., with a transformed divergence equal to 0.5 and a scale factor equal to 10. The developed procedure agrees with the empirical data for the optimal smoothness parameter. The study shows that SRM is now applicable to a larger set of images with class separability ranging from poor to excellent.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5210215/04926200.pdf","startPage":"3283","endPage":"3297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4926200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantification of the Effects of Land-Cover-Class Spectral Separability on the Accuracy of Markov-Random-Field-Based Superresolution Mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Image sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Remote sensing","Image classification","Markov random fields","Vegetation mapping","Geoscience","Energy resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","image classification","Markov processes","terrain mapping","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land-cover-class effect","superresolution mapping","SRM","posterior energy function","energy balance analysis","image synthesis","agriculture","land-cover-map image","kappa statistic","image classification","Markov-Random-field","MRF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class separability","image classification","Markov random field (MRF)","superresolution mapping (SRM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantification of the Effects of Land-Cover-Class Spectral Separability on the Accuracy of Markov-Random-Field-Based Superresolution Mapping","volume":"47","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4926200/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840340","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantification of the Effects of Land-Cover-Class Spectral Separability on the Accuracy of Markov-Random-Field-Based Superresolution Mapping","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tolpekin-2019126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11728S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5210215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5210215","articleId":"4926200","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4926201,"authors":[{"name":"Pietro Andricciola","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Andricciola","id":"37393184300"},{"name":"Hans P.

Three candidate channel feedback schemes are investigated, including practical aspects, such as the effects of terminal measurement errors, bandwidth measurement granularity, quantization, and uplink signaling delays. The performance is evaluated by means of system-level simulations with detailed modeling of various radio resource-management algorithms, etc. Our results show that the optimal tradeoff between the channel feedback and the downlink OFDMA system performance depends on the radio channel frequency coherence bandwidth. We conclude that the so-called average best-M scheme is the most attractive channel feedback solution, where only the average channel quality for the best \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n subbands is reported, together with a bit mask identifying those subbands.

Accuracy and interpretability are measured in terms of approximation error and rule base (RB) complexity, respectively. The proposed approach is based on concurrently learning RBs and parameters of the membership functions of the associated linguistic labels. To manage the size of the search space, we have integrated the linguistic two-tuple representation model, which allows the symbolic translation of a label by only considering one parameter, with an efficient modification of the well known (2 + 2) Pareto archived evolution strategy (PAES). We tested our approach on nine real world datasets of different sizes and with different numbers of variables. Besides the (2 + 2)PAES, we have also used the well known nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and an accuracy-driven single-objective evolutionary algorithm (EA). We employed these optimization techniques both to concurrently learn rules and parameters and to learn only rules. We compared the different approaches by applying a nonparametric statistical test for pairwise comparisons, thus taking into consideration three representative points from the obtained Pareto fronts in the case of the multiobjective EAs. Finally, a data complexity measure, which is typically used in pattern recognition to evaluate the data density in terms of average number of patterns per variable, has been introduced to characterize regression problems. Results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, particularly for (possibly high dimensional) datasets with high values of the complexity metric.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2023113","startPage":"1106","endPage":"1122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5272826/04926209.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2023113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiobjective Evolutionary Approach to Concurrently Learn Rule and Data Bases of Linguistic Fuzzy-Rule-Based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Evolutionary computation","Testing","Genetic algorithms","Approximation error","Sorting","Density measurement","Pattern recognition","Computer science education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computational linguistics","fuzzy systems","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","Pareto optimisation","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective evolutionary approach","fuzzy-rule-based system","linguistic two-tuple representation model","Pareto archived evolution strategy","genetic algorithm","evolutionary algorithm","pattern recognition","rule base complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accuracy\u2013interpretability tradeoff","fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs)","linguistic two-tuple representation","multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4926209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Multiobjective Evolutionary Approach to Concurrently Learn Rule and Data Bases of Linguistic Fuzzy-Rule-Based Systems","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4926209/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10891898","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiobjective Evolutionary Approach to Concurrently Learn Rule and Data Bases of Linguistic Fuzzy-Rule-Based Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-alcala-2023113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105571S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5272826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"5272826","articleId":"4926209","onlineDate":"15 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4926211,"authors":[{"name":"Valtemir E. do Nascimento","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Technology of Mato Grosso do Sul, Cuiaba, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Valtemir E. do Nascimento received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from S\u00e3o Carlos School of Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil, in 2007.","Since 2008, he has been with the Electrical Engineering Department, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Cuiab\u00e1, Brazil.

Coefficient of variation is used to distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous areas.

First, a method to analytically approximate the mean number of events to failure of memories protected with error correction codes capable of handling multiple bit errors is presented and validated through simulation experiments. Then, the selection of the optimal protection code for a given memory configuration in terms of memory size, word length, and target reliability level is analyzed. This selection process is illustrated using a practical case study. The study is then extended to determine, for a given error correcting code, the maximum memory size that would meet a target reliability level. Finally, the effect of the memory word size on the system reliability is considered by comparing different options.

Self-guided GA is belonged to the category of evolutionary algorithms based on probabilistic models (EAPM) and it is effective and efficient in solving the scheduling problems. In order to further enhance the performance of this algorithm, it is thus integrated with DPs because DPs is a mathematical algorithm which is able to generate good solutions quickly. As a result, the solutions generated by DPs will be applied as the initial population of self-guided GA instead of using the randomly generated initial solutions. When we conducted an extensive experiments to validate DP-self-guided GA, it is statistically significant when we compared it with existing algorithms in the literature. As a result, the implication of this approach is a good heuristic which may further improve the performance of an EAPM algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SCIS.2009.4927018","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911214/4927001/04927018.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"83","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCIS.2009.4927018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-guided genetic algorithm with dominance properties for single machine scheduling problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2 2009-March 30 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Self-guided genetic algorithm with dominance properties for single machine scheduling problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647258","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4927018/","conferenceDate":"2 April-30 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-guided genetic algorithm with dominance properties for single machine scheduling problems","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"SC-3015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112699S","chronDate":"April 2 2009-March 30 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911214","isNumber":"4927001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911214","xplore-issue":"4927001","articleId":"4927018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4927022,"authors":[{"name":"Weigang Jiang","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base of Zhuhai College, Department of Computer Science of Zhuhai College, Jinan University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Weigang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37399917100"},{"name":"Yuanbiao Zhang","affiliation":["Packaging Engineering Institute, Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base of Zhuhai College, Jinan University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yuanbiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405800600"},{"name":"Jianwen Xie","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base of Zhuhai College, Department of Computer Science of Zhuhai College, Jinan University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Xie","id":"37405095100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2757-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4927022","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Vehicles","Routing","Logistics","Mathematical model","Costs","Computer science","Time factors","Transportation","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation","probability","road vehicles","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","vehicle routing problem","time windows","combinatorial optimization","nonlinear programming problem","crossover operation","genetic algorithm","probability searching","parallel PSO algorithms","discrete combinatory problems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SCIS.2009.4927022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCIS.2009.4927022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927001","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911214/4927001/04927022.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm with crossover for vehicle routing problem with time windows","abstract":"The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a very important combinatorial optimization and nonlinear programming problem in the fields of transportation, distribution and logistics. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with crossover for VRP is proposed. The PSO algorithm combined with the crossover operation of genetic algorithm (GA) can avoid being trapped in local optimum due to using probability searching. We apply the proposed algorithm to an example of VRP, and compare its result with those generated by PSO, GA, and parallel PSO algorithms. The experimental comparison result demonstrates that the performance of PSO algorithm with crossover is competitive with others and will be an effective method for solving discrete combinatory problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2 2009-March 30 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2 April-30 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10647262","htmlLink":"/document/4927022/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm with crossover for vehicle routing problem with time windows","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm with crossover for vehicle routing problem with time windows","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"SC-3005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14915S","chronDate":"April 2 2009-March 30 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911214","isNumber":"4927001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911214","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4927001","articleId":"4927022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4927420,"authors":[{"name":"Ian C.

We found outdoor-indoor channels to be in between these two extremes, in the sense that we observed directivity - and - MIMO gain, for the same ensemble of channels. Our observation is based on measurements with directive (8 dB) and dipole antennas. Median MIMO capacities were found to be about 80% of the ideal (Rayleigh i.i.d.), at 5 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR), for both types of antennas. Using properly aimed directive antennas, the SNR was found on average to be 5.4 dB above that obtainable with dipoles, somewhat less than the 7 dB antenna gain difference. Thus, isotropic propagation, which would have negated directivity gains, cannot be justified in general. We empirically established that aiming for largest received power is the best array pointing strategy with directive antennas. Combining MIMO processing and angular search resulted on average in gains of 70% over the median capacities obtained with dipoles. Therefore it may in some cases be convenient to arrange subgroups of antennas for beamforming, and then process the thus reduced number of radio channels for MIMO gain.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.070662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927423.pdf","startPage":"2177","endPage":"2181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.070662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving MIMO capacity with directive antennas for outdoor-indoor scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927423/","displayDocTitle":"Improving MIMO capacity with directive antennas for outdoor-indoor scenarios","volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10683872","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4927423/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving MIMO capacity with directive antennas for outdoor-indoor scenarios","sourcePdf":"2177-tw0905-hermosilla.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073884S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4927425,"authors":[{"name":"Fuad E.

This increases power consumption and chip area substantially. In this letter, we introduce a new Code-Modulated Path-Sharing Multi-Antenna (CPMA) receiver architecture suitable for any multi-antenna scheme including spatial multiplexing, spatial diversity, and beamforming. The receiver uses code modulation to distinguish the antenna signals before combining them in the analog domain. The combined signal propagates through shared-path blocks and all the original signals are later recovered in the digital domain for further processing. Due to the spread spectrum nature of code modulation, a larger bandwidth is needed for the blocks in the shared path. To alleviate this effect, the use of non-orthogonal coding is examined. An effective channel matrix is derived and the system capacity is evaluated in terms of the cross-correlation between signature codes. Implementation and code selection issues are discussed.

The PEP is then used to evaluate the union upper bound for convolutional codes with Viterbi decoding.

This paper presents an IQ imbalance estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) direct conversion receivers. The proposed IQ imbalance estimation scheme operates in the presence of dynamic DC offset and frequency offset. The proposed scheme calculates IQ imbalance from a simple equation. It employs the knowledge of the preamble symbols of the IEEE 802.11 a/g standards, while it does not require the impulse response of the channel.

We discuss various properties owing to PLP and elaborate on the main parameters affecting the PLP value. We present three theorems, propose some simple upper bounds on the PLP, and give an insight on the main contributions of the results. We introduce a fundamental parameter, namely \u00df, as a key design parameter which relates the most important quantities affecting the PLP behavior. Finally, we propose a corollary demonstrating an approach to guarantee that the PLP value is set at zero. It is shown that using suitable distributions, we can also obtain some distribution gain, thereby enhancing the overall system performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927442.pdf","startPage":"2296","endPage":"2301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel probabilistic bounds on power level profile of spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Upper bound","Signal design","Wireless communication","Signal processing","Bandwidth","Performance gain","System performance","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","encoding","probability","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA signal","probabilistic approach","power level profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PLP","SE/ST CDMA","code design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel probabilistic bounds on power level profile of spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA signals","volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4927442/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665957","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel probabilistic bounds on power level profile of spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA signals","sourcePdf":"2296-tw0905-mashhadi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083175S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4927444,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Nian Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiang Nian","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37272246500"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4927444","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":571},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency conversion","Frequency estimation","Least squares approximation","Mean square error methods","Robustness","Computational modeling","Convergence","Computational complexity","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","communication complexity","convergence of numerical methods","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","frequency estimation","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint carrier frequency offset estimation","channel estimation","OFDMA uplink","variable projection method","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","least square criterion","non-separated minimum mean square error method","MMSE method","convergence rate","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset estimation","channel estimation","minimum mean square error","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","uplink","variable projection method"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation method for the uplink channel of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. The proposed method includes two steps. In the first step, the variable projection (VP) method based on the least squares (LS) criterion is used for CFO estimation. In each iteration of the VP method, the CFOs and channel coefficients are updated separately, which distinguishes the VP method from an existing non-separated minimum mean square error (MMSE) method in which the CFOs and channel coefficients are treated together as a whole. In the second step, the channel is estimated by employing the robust MMSE method. The simulation results show that, compared with the non-separated MMSE method, the proposed method has faster convergence rate in terms of CFO estimation and achieves better channel estimation performance in most of the cases. The computational complexity of the proposed scheme is also lower than that of the non-separated MMSE method for large number of users at high signal-to-noise ratios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint CFO and channel estimation for OFDMA uplink: an application of the variable projection method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927444.pdf","startPage":"2306","endPage":"2311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927444/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint CFO and channel estimation for OFDMA uplink: an application of the variable projection method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4927444/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665959","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint CFO and channel estimation for OFDMA uplink: an application of the variable projection method","sourcePdf":"2306-tw0905-zeng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059169S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4927449,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-dong Lee","affiliation":["Research & Standards Department, LG Electronics Mobile Research, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927449/4927449-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ki-Dong Lee (S'00-A'01-M'04-SM'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in operation research and the Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering (with applications to wireless networks) from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea.

However, the complexity of the problem makes it computationally too expensive to solve simultaneously for all the cells in a system of reasonable size. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive and distributed slot allocation scheme for transporting multimedia traffic over CDMA/TDD cellular networks with multiple cells, designed to maximize a general utility function that is (strictly) concave increasing. We formulate the utility-maximizing slot allocation problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem, and provide a solution that can be realized efficiently in a distributed manner. Also, we derive sufficient conditions for a real-number solution to be optimal and develop an efficient algorithm to find a near-optimal integer solution. The effectiveness of the integer solution is demonstrated by showing that its gap with the optimal solution is small. We show by experiments that the proposed predictive method has a sufficient accuracy when there are many active users in cells. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed distributed slot allocation method performs very well in comparison to an existing method.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.070086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.070086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient local predictive method for distributed timeslot allocation in CDMA/TDD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient local predictive method for distributed timeslot allocation in CDMA/TDD","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665964","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4927449/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient local predictive method for distributed timeslot allocation in CDMA/TDD","sourcePdf":"2341-tw0905-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087384S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4927451,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent K.

Currently, multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO), inter-cell coordination and multi-hop relay technologies are viable options for improving channel capacity or coverage extension. Nevertheless, severe QoS degradation occurs in the outer region of multi-cells due to significant interference from neighboring cells or relay stations, thereby limiting overall performance. This paper describes an effective technique, fixed relay station cooperated beam-forming (FCBF), which combines MIMO, multi-hop relay and multi-cell coordination. Simulated testing of FCBF demonstrates an increase of 10% in the average sum-rate and a decrease of 25% in the outage probability compared with conventional techniques. In particular, throughput at the cell boundary is remarkably increased with FCBF compared with traditional beam-forming technologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4927455/","accessionNumber":"10665970","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and QoS improvement via fixed relay station cooperated beam-forming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and QoS improvement via fixed relay station cooperated beam-forming","sourcePdf":"2400-tw0905-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056295S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4927456,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927456/4927456-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Wang obtained B.

Specifically, the sensing module first determines whether or not a channel resource is available for the CR system based on the sensing information. The scheduling module then schedules the data transmission of different users on the available channels based on the hard-decision sensing information (HSI). In this paper, we shall propose a joint crosslayer and sensing design and study its performance advantages over the aforementioned traditional decoupled approaches. We shall consider the downlink transmission of an OFDMA-based secondary system sharing the spectrum with primary users using cognitive radio technology. We shall rely on the joint design framework to optimize a system utility, which adapts the power allocation and the subcarrier assignment across the secondary users (under a average interference constraint to the primary users) based on both the channel state information (CSI) and the raw sensing information (RSI). In addition, we shall also propose a distributed implementation for the cross-layer sensing and scheduling design using primal-dual decomposition approach. Simulation results reveals the substantial performance gain of the proposed joint design over the conventional CR systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927456.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","startPage":"2410","endPage":"2416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint cross-layer scheduling and spectrum sensing for OFDMA cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint cross-layer scheduling and spectrum sensing for OFDMA cognitive radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10683874","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4927456/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint cross-layer scheduling and spectrum sensing for OFDMA cognitive radio systems","sourcePdf":"2410-tw0905-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062675S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4927457,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Behravan","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927457/4927457-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Behravan received his PhD in electrical engineering from Chalmers university of technology in 2006.

The method is based on tone reservation, and the free tones are assigned in a way to limit the variations of the instantaneous power of the time domain signal. The problem is shown to be convex, and by adding an equality constraint, zero constellation error is guaranteed. We present an iterative solution for this problem, and show that the globally optimal point can be approached by only a few iterations. Both in-band and out-of-band distortions are reduced at the expense of a small increase in bandwidth of the signal. The corrected signal is less sensitive to nonlinearities, and therefore the distortion is reduced for all input backoff values.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071096","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927457.pdf","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tone reservation to reduce the envelope fluctuations of multicarrier signals","volume":"8","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4927457/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665971","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927457/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tone reservation to reduce the envelope fluctuations of multicarrier signals","sourcePdf":"2417-tw0905-behravan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05292S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4927460,"authors":[{"name":"Edward W.

We are focusing on systems with a fixed and finite input constellation, as encountered in most practical systems. Generalizing previous results, we derive the optimal power allocation scheme that minimizes the outage probability of block-fading channels with arbitrary input constellations, subject to PAPR constraints. We further show that the signal-to-noise ratio exponent for any finite peak-to-average power ratio is the same as that of the peak-power limited problem, resulting in an error floor. We also derive the optimal power allocation strategies that maximize the ergodic capacity for arbitrary input channels, subject to average and PAPR constraints.We show that capacities with peak-to-average power ratio constraints, even for small ratios, are close to capacities without peak-power restrictions. For both delay-limited and ergodic block-fading channels, the optimal power allocation strategies rely on the first derivative of the input-output mutual information, which may be computationally prohibitive for efficient practical implementation. To overcome this limitation, we develop suboptimal power allocation schemes that resemble the traditional water-filling technique.

Conventionally, each relay equally distributes the available resources to its relayed sources. This approach is clearly sub-optimal since each user experiences dissimilar channel conditions, and thus, demands different amount of allocated resources to meet its quality-of-service (QoS) request. Therefore, this paper presents novel power allocation schemes to i) maximize the minimum signal-to-noise ratio among all users; ii) minimize the maximum transmit power over all sources; iii) maximize the network throughput. Moreover, due to limited power, it may be impossible to satisfy the QoS requirement for every user. Consequently, an admission control algorithm should first be carried out to maximize the number of users possibly served. Then, optimal power allocation is performed. Although the joint optimal admission control and power allocation problem is combinatorially hard, we develop an effective heuristic algorithm with significantly reduced complexity. Even though theoretically sub-optimal, it performs remarkably well. The proposed power allocation problems are formulated using geometric programming (GP), a well-studied class of nonlinear and nonconvex optimization. Since a GP problem is readily transformed into an equivalent convex optimization problem, optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2545","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927469.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation in wireless multi-user relay networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4927469/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power allocation in wireless multi-user relay networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665983","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation in wireless multi-user relay networks","sourcePdf":"2535-tw0905-phan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13684S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4927471,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Ruan","affiliation":["National ICT Australia, Australian National University, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927471/4927471-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming (Matt) Ruan received the B.

The existing literature studied the case where there was only one training symbol consisting of identical segments. We generalize the timing synchronization methods to take advantage of multiple training symbols and only require the segments to be highly correlated but not necessarily identical. We construct a series of component timing metrics, one for each pair of the highly correlated segments, and combine them linearly to minimize the false alarm probability while keeping the asymptotic missed detection probability to the same level as other techniques. The OFDM data symbols in a downlink burst can have different power levels to reach the users at different distances. We take that into account and yield more realistic results than those in existing literature which only considered the equal power case. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed in three scenarios generalized from the IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 standards. Numerical results are presented to confirm the robustness of the proposed method in various channel conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training symbol based coarse timing synchronization in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927471.pdf","startPage":"2558","endPage":"2569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Training symbol based coarse timing synchronization in OFDM systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4927471/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665985","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training symbol based coarse timing synchronization in OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"2558-tw0905-ruan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176353S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4927472,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Kin Au-Yeung","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Systems and Applications, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927472/4927472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun Kin Au Yeung received the B.A.Sc degree in computer engineering from University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada, in 2004.

For analytical tractability, most existing papers assume the existence of an ideal fixed-rate feedback channel to assist the transmitter to adapt to instantaneous channel conditions. The relationship between the feedback rate and data rate is typically analyzed in a unidirectional manner. In reality, judicious resource allocation to transmitting feedback and data leads to a tradeoff between the effective forward and reverse data rates. In this paper, we represent the achievable rate by effective SNRs, and we present a framework to analyze the tradeoff. We find that the forward and reverse rate tradeoff can be decomposed into two local tradeoffs, resulting from the resource allocation policy of each user. The local tradeoff region for each user is found in closed-form, whereas the overall tradeoff region is approximated for the special case when the two users have equal hardware configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665924","htmlLink":"/document/4927472/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization and tradeoff analysis of two-way limited feedback beamforming systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and tradeoff analysis of two-way limited feedback beamforming systems","sourcePdf":"2570-tw0905-yeung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054774S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4927474,"authors":[{"name":"Chonggang Wang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927474/4927474-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chonggang Wang received his Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).

Gen-2 protocol has a critical parameter Q that plays an important role in resolving tag collisions. Gen-2 protocol proposes an adaptive slot-count algorithm to adjust Q dynamically based on the type of replies from tags. In this paper, we define two performance metrics for tag identification: Query Success Rate (QSR) and tag identification speed (TIS). We establish a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model for the Gen-2 and accordingly obtain quantitative results of QSR and TIS. Extensive simulations validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the number of tags has little impact on the performance. In other words, QSR and TIS do not nearly decrease even though the number of tags may be increasing. Our model for Gen-2 protocol is also useful to study the performance of other RFID protocols.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927474.pdf","startPage":"2592","endPage":"2601","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of RFID Generation-2 protocol","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of RFID Generation-2 protocol","volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4927474/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665925","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927474/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of RFID Generation-2 protocol","sourcePdf":"2592-tw0905-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05877S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4927477,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927477/4927477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Dai (S'01-M'08) received his Ph.D. and M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2007 and 2004 respectively.

This joint strategy differs from an individual strategy in which quantization and feedback are performed independently across users, and it improves upon the individual strategy in the same way that vector quantization improves upon scalar quantization. To analyze the proposed strategy, the effect of user selection is described by extreme order statistics, while the effect of joint quantization is quantified through what we term \"the composite Grassmann manifold\".

In the networking literature, this phenomenon is typically abstracted using a wireless channel interference model. The level of detail in the interference model, evidently determines the accuracy of the results based upon the model. Several works in the networking literature have made use of simplistic interference models, e.g., fixed ranges for communication and interference, the capture threshold model (used in the ns2 network simulator), the protocol model, and so on. At the same time, fairly complex interference models such as those based on the SINR (signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio) have also been proposed and used. We investigate the impact of the choice of the interference model, on the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the performance of wireless networks, by comparing different wireless interference models. We find that both in the case of random access networks, as well as in the case of scheduled networks (where node transmissions are scheduled to be completely conflict-free), different interference models can produce significantly different results.

In the literature, EVM has been related to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for data-aided receivers, where preamble sequences or pilots are used to measure the EVM, or under the assumption of high SNR values. In this paper, this relation is examined for nondata-aided receivers and is shown to perform poorly, especially for low SNR values or high modulation orders. The EVM for nondata-aided receivers is then evaluated and its value is related to the SNR for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels, and for systems with IQ imbalances. The results show that derived equations can be used to reliably estimate SNR values using EVM measurements that are made based on detected data symbols. Thus, presented work can be quite useful for measurement devices such as vector signal analyzers (VSA), where EVM measurements are readily available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927484/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","volume":"8","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"10665933","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4927484/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error vector magnitude to SNR conversion for nondata-aided receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error vector magnitude to SNR conversion for nondata-aided receivers","sourcePdf":"2694-tw0905-mahmoud.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093741S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4927485,"authors":[{"name":"Tilde Fusco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Biomedica, Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4927418/4927485/4927485-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tilde Fusco was born in Napoli, Italy, on March 22, 1977.

As all multicarrier systems, FBMC systems are very sensitive to synchronization errors, since CFO and symbol timing errors cause interference between successive symbols and adjacent subcarriers which can lead to a severe performance degradation. Therefore, reliable and accurate synchronization algorithms must be designed for these systems. The approach herein presented is based on the deployment of appropriate training sequences. In particular, we propose a new joint symbol timing and CFO synchronization algorithm based on the least squares approach and exploiting the transmission of a training sequence made up of identical parts. The performance of the derived estimators, assessed by computer simulations, is compared with that of two data-aided synchronization algorithms previously proposed in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4927418/04927485.pdf","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-aided symbol timing and CFO synchronization for filter bank multicarrier systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Filter bank","Frequency synchronization","OFDM","Interference","Signal processing algorithms","Degradation","Least squares methods","Wireless sensor networks","Pulse shaping methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","least squares approximations","radiofrequency interference","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-aided symbol timing","CFO synchronization","filter bank multicarrier systems","carrier-frequency offset","data-aided joint symbol timing","filter bank-based multicarrier systems","adjacent subcarriers","performance degradation","least squares approach","data-aided synchronization algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-aided estimation","carrier-frequency offset","symbol timing","filter bank multicarrier systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Data-aided symbol timing and CFO synchronization for filter bank multicarrier systems","volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4927485/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665934","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-aided symbol timing and CFO synchronization for filter bank multicarrier systems","sourcePdf":"2705-tw0905-fusco.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075754S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4927418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4927418","articleId":"4927485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4927521,"authors":[{"name":"Xuerui Bai","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuerui","lastName":"Bai","id":"37629628000"},{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongbin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277016800"},{"name":"Jianqiang Yi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianqiang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37277001200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2761-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1824"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1867"}],"articleNumber":"4927521","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Dynamic programming","Communication system traffic control","Performance analysis","Laboratories","Intelligent systems","Automation","Automatic control","Feedback control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","queueing theory","road traffic","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ADHDP strategies","queuing consideration","traffic management strategy","action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming","local ramp metering problem","traffic density"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927521","abstract":"Ramp metering has been developed as a traffic management strategy to alleviate congestion on freeways.

In this paper, on the basis of our previous studies, we use action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming based on eligibility traces (ADHDP(lambda)) to solve local ramp metering and multiple ramps metering problems with queuing consideration. First, for the local ramp metering problem, we establish a comprehensive performance index which considers both traffic density and on-ramp queue length. Second, for the multiple ramps metering problem, based on ADHDP(lambda), the coordinated ramps metering and regulating queue lengths are achieved at the same time. Simulation studies on a hypothetical freeway are reported.

Due to incomplete neural and anatomical data, traditional neural network training methods fail to model the sensory-motor systems. Here we introduce a novel modeling method based on stochastic optimal control framework which is well suited for this purpose. Our controller is implemented with a recurrent neural network (RNN) whose goal is approximating the optimal global control law for the given plant and cost function. We employ a risk-sensitive objective function proposed by Jacobson (1973) for robustness of controller. For maximum optimization efficiency, we introduce a step response sampling method, which minimizes complexity of the optimization problem. We use conjugate gradient descent method for optimization, and gradient is calculated via Pontryagin's maximum principle. In the end, we obtain highly stable and robust RNN controllers that can generate infinite varieties of attractor dynamics of the plant, which are proposed as building blocks of movement generation.

Under these assumptions, a polynomial algorithm, in terms of the sample size and length of the optimization horizon, is derived to compute these bounds, and their tightness is characterized in terms of the sample density.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Computational modeling","Polynomials","Optimal control","Dynamic programming","Predictive models","Fingers","Upper bound","Biomedical engineering","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous systems","optimal control","optimisation","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control policy","trajectories sample","reward function","Lipschitz continuous","polynomial algorithm","optimization horizon"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ADPRL.2009.4927534","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning","pdfPath":"/iel5/4910084/4927513/04927534.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADPRL.2009.4927534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inferring bounds on the performance of a control policy from a sample of trajectories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inferring bounds on the performance of a control policy from a sample of trajectories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927534/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4927534/","accessionNumber":"10647020","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inferring bounds on the performance of a control policy from a sample of trajectories","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"AD-1011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048673S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4910084","isNumber":"4927513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910084","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4927513","articleId":"4927534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4927535,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Xin Zhang","id":"37537451400"},{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Huaguang Zhang","id":"37280792300"},{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Derong Liu","id":"37277008500"},{"name":"Yongsu Kim","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Yongsu Kim","id":"37635325700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2761-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1824"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1867"}],"articleNumber":"4927535","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Adaptive control","Programmable control","Lyapunov method","Actuators","Servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","discrete time systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network-based reinforcement learning controller","nonlinear system","non-symmetric dead-zone input","adaptive controller","strategic utility function","close-loop tracking error","Lyapunov method"]}],"abstract":"A novel adaptive-critic-based NN controller using reinforcement learning is developed for a class of nonlinear systems with non-symmetric dead-zone inputs. The adaptive critic NN controller uses two NNs: the critic NN is used to approximate the strategic utility function, and the output of action NN is used to approximate the unknown nonlinear function and to minimize the strategic utility function. The tuning of the NNs is performed online without an explicit offline learning phase. The uniformly ultimate boundedness of the close-loop tracking error is derived by using using the Lyapunov method. Finally, a numerical example is included to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network-based reinforcement learning controller for nonlinear systems with non-symmetric dead-zone inputs","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning","doi":"10.1109/ADPRL.2009.4927535","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning","pdfPath":"/iel5/4910084/4927513/04927535.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADPRL.2009.4927535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4927513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4927535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4927535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based reinforcement learning controller for nonlinear systems with non-symmetric dead-zone inputs","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4927535/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10647021","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based reinforcement learning controller for nonlinear systems with non-symmetric dead-zone inputs","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"AD-1002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064238S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4910084","isNumber":"4927513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910084","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4927513","articleId":"4927535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"}]
