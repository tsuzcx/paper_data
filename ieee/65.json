Four types of predictors are studied: mean, weighted mean, median, and statistical mean. The weighted mean is obtained using conventional linear prediction techniques. The statistical mean is obtained using a finite-state machine modeling method based on dynamic vector quantization. By employing prediction, the motion vector search can then be constrained to a small area. The effective search area is reduced further by varying its size based on the local statistics of the motion field, through using a Lagrangian as the search matching measure and imposing probabilistic models during the search process. The proposed motion estimation techniques are analyzed within a simple DCT-based video coding framework, where an RD criterion is used for alternating among three coding modes for each 8/spl times/8 block: motion only, motion-compensated prediction and DCT, and intra-DCT. Experimental results indicate that our techniques yield very good computation-performance tradeoffs.

The concatenated hybrid ARQ scheme we propose combines the advantages of both type-I and type-II hybrid ARQ schemes. Certain error correction capability is provided in each (re)transmitted packet, and the information can be recovered from each transmission or retransmission alone if the errors are within the error correction capability (similar to type-I hybrid ARQ). The retransmitted packet contains redundancy bits which, when combined with the previous transmission, result in a more powerful RS/convolutional concatenated code to recover information if error correction fails for the individual transmissions (similar to type-II hybrid ARQ). Bit-error rate (BER) or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a radio channel changes over time due to mobile movement and fading. The channel quality at any instant depends on the previous channel conditions. For the accurate analysis of the performance of the hybrid ARQ scheme, we use a multistate Markov chain (MSMC) to model the radio channel at the data packet level. We propose a method to partition the range of the received SNR into a set of states for constructing the model so that the difference between the error rate of the real radio channel and that of the MSMC model is minimized. Based on the model, we analyze the performance of the concatenated hybrid ARQ scheme. The results give valuable insight into the effects of the error protection capability in each packet, the mobile speed, and the number of retransmissions. Finally, the transmission of H.263 coded video over a wireless channel with error protection provided by the concatenated hybrid ARQ scheme is studied by means of simulations.","doi":"10.1109/49.650050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/14169/00650050.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.650050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14169","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of H.263 video transmission over wireless channels using hybrid ARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of H.263 video transmission over wireless channels using hybrid ARQ","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5796862","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of H.263 video transmission over wireless channels using hybrid ARQ","sourcePdf":"00650050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028607S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"63","articleId":"650050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":650052,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first stage of this system extracts the contour of the object using a hybrid first- and second-order differential edge detector. The object defined by its contour is then decomposed into its constituent parts using the part segmentation algorithm given by Bennamoun (1994). These parts are then isolated and modeled with 2D superquadrics. The parameters of the models are obtained by the minimization of a best-fit cost function. The object is then represented by its structural description which is a set of data structures whose predicates represent the constituent parts of the object and whose arguments represent the spatial relationship between these parts. This representation allows the recognition of objects independently of their positions, orientations, or sizes. It is also insensitive to objects with partially missing parts. In this paper, examples illustrating the acquired images of objects, the extraction of their contours, the isolation of the parts, and their fitting with 2D superquadrics are reported. The reconstruction of objects from their structural description is illustrated and improvements are suggested.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3477/14161/00650052.pdf","startPage":"893","endPage":"906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/3477.650052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.650052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A structural-description-based vision system for automatic object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Object recognition","Image edge detection","Detectors","Shape","Signal processing algorithms","Two dimensional displays","Cost function","Filters","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","edge detection","object recognition","feature extraction","image segmentation","curve fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","automatic object recognition","structural-description","differential edge detector","part segmentation","2D superquadrics","parameter selection","object recognition","contour extraction","convex point","dominant point","Gaussian filter","best-fit cost function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"A structural-description-based vision system for automatic object recognition","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5762862","pubMedId":"18263099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A structural-description-based vision system for automatic object recognition","sourcePdf":"00650052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042995S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"23","articleId":"650052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":650054,"authors":[{"name":"Ching Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Ching Zhang","id":"37087169196"},{"name":"A.K.C.

By converting biomolecular sequence alignment into a problem of searching for an optimal or a near-optimal point in a solution space, a genetic algorithm is used to find match blocks very efficiently. A pairwise dynamic programming is then applied to the subsequences between the match blocks.

The approach calls for sampling the function over a set of rectangular grid points and applying singular value decomposition to the sample matrix. The resulting quantities are then tailored to become rule consequences and membership functions via the conditions of sum normalization and non-negativeness. The inference paradigm of product-sum-gravity is apparent from the structure of the decomposition equation. All information are extracted directly from the function samples. The present approach yields a class of equivalent fuzzy approximator to a given function. A tight bounding technique to facilitate normal or close-to-normal membership functions is also formulated. The fuzzy output approximates the given function to within an error which is dependent on the sampling intervals and the singular values discarded from the approximation process. Trade-off between the number of membership functions and the desired approximation accuracy is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/3477.650055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3477/14161/00650055.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.650055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy approximation via grid point sampling and singular value decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650055/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy approximation via grid point sampling and singular value decomposition","volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5762865","pubMedId":"18263102","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy approximation via grid point sampling and singular value decomposition","sourcePdf":"00650055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044294S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"78","articleId":"650055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":650059,"authors":[{"name":"Der-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Matsushita Electric Works Limited, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Der-Sheng Lin","id":"37087537542"},{"name":"Jin-Jang Leou","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Jang Leou","id":"37087202540"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"650059","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":116},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Writing","Handwriting recognition","Feature extraction","Linearity","Image segmentation","Councils","Research and development","Computer science","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chinese","handwriting recognition","genetic algorithm","fitness function","normalization","stroke density variation","character area coverage","centroid offset"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3477.650059","pdfPath":"/iel3/3477/14161/00650059.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","startPage":"999","endPage":"1007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.650059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach to Chinese handwriting normalization","abstract":"Normalization can be used to absorb writing variations and distortions, simplify the recognition processing steps, and improve the recognition rate of a Chinese handwriting recognition system.

This paper discusses the application of a three-layer radial-basis function neural network (RBFNN), which can learn multiple source-direction findings of a six-element array. The network weights are modified using the normalized cumulative delta rule. The performance of this network is compared to that of the MUSIC algorithm for both uncorrelated and correlated signals.

The kernel of the convolution integral has a square-root singularity for which an efficient numerical integration rule is presented. Using this technique, a very accurate solution is obtained; however, convolution integrals are computationally expensive with or without singularities. As an alternative, a rapidly convergent approximate series expansion for the convolution integral is presented, which can be used both in the near and far zone. Results using the new 2-D transform are compared with analytical expressions for the fields generated by a modulated Gaussian pulse for TE and TM line sources. In addition, the 2-D transform solution for the near-zone fields scattered from an open-ended cavity for a TE incident modulated Gaussian pulse plane wave is compared against a full-grid FDTD solution for accuracy and efficiency.

Sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability and input/output stability of NL/sub q/ systems are available, including three types of criteria: (1) diagonal scaling; (2) criteria depending on diagonal dominance; (3) condition number factors of certain matrices. The paper discusses how Narendra's (1990, 1991) dynamic backpropagation procedure, which is used for identifying recurrent neural networks from I/O measurements, can be modified with an NL/sub q/ stability constraint in order to ensure globally asymptotically stable identified models. An example illustrates how system identification of an internally stable model corrupted by process noise may lead to unwanted limit cycle behavior and how this problem can be avoided by adding the stability constraint.","doi":"10.1109/78.650094","startPage":"2682","endPage":"2691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14188/00650094.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NL/sub q/ theory: checking and imposing stability of recurrent neural networks for nonlinear modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650094/","displayDocTitle":"NL/sub q/ theory: checking and imposing stability of recurrent neural networks for nonlinear modeling","volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5765009","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NL/sub q/ theory: checking and imposing stability of recurrent neural networks for nonlinear modeling","sourcePdf":"00650094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066354S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","articleId":"650094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":650095,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Ichi Amari","affiliation":["RIKEN Frontier Research, Saitama, Japan"],"lastName":"Shun-Ichi Amari","id":"37268618600"},{"name":"J.-F.

In particular, due to their capacity to form complex decision regions, NNs have been successfully used in adaptive equalization of digital communication channels. The mean square error (MSE) criterion, which is usually adopted in neural learning, is not directly related to the minimization of the classification error, i.e., bit error rate (BER), which is of interest in channel equalization. Moreover, common gradient-based learning techniques are often characterized by slow speed of convergence and numerical ill conditioning. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that exploits the principle of discriminative learning, minimizing an error functional that is a direct measure of the classification error. The proposed method extends to RNNs a technique applied with success to fast learning of feedforward NNs and is based on the descent of the error functional in the space of the linear combinations of the neurons (the neuron space); its main features are higher speed of convergence and better numerical conditioning w.r.t. gradient-based approaches, whereas numerical stability is assured by the use of robust least squares solvers. Experiments regarding the equalization of PAM signals in different transmission channels are described, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/78.650099","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14188/00650099.pdf","startPage":"2731","endPage":"2739","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast adaptive digital equalization by recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast adaptive digital equalization by recurrent neural networks","volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5765014","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast adaptive digital equalization by recurrent neural networks","sourcePdf":"00650099.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050065S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"66","articleId":"650099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":650101,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

The literature documents a development from the use of neural networks as explicit inverses to neural network iterative inversion (NNII) and, finally, to Bayesian neural network iterative inversion (BNNII), which adds a Bayesian superstructure to NNII. Inverse problems have been often considered ill posed, i.e. the statement of the problem does not thoroughly constrain the solution space. BNNII takes advantage of this lack of information by adding additional informative constraints to the problem solution using Bayesian methodology. This paper extends BNNII, showing how ground truth information, information regarding the particular parameter contour under reconstruction, and information regarding the underlying physical process, can be seamlessly added to the problem solution. Remote sensing problems afford opportunities for inclusion of ground truth information, prior probabilities, noise distributions, and other informative constraints within a Bayesian probabilistic framework. We apply these Bayesian methods to a synthetic remote sensing problem, showing that the addition of ground truth information, which is naturally included through Bayesian modeling, provides a significant performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/78.650101","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14188/00650101.pdf","startPage":"2749","endPage":"2757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving inverse problems by Bayesian neural network iterative inversion with ground truth incorporation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Solving inverse problems by Bayesian neural network iterative inversion with ground truth incorporation","volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5765016","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving inverse problems by Bayesian neural network iterative inversion with ground truth incorporation","sourcePdf":"00650101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05682S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","articleId":"650101","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":650102,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Efficient classification is achieved with a fewer number of automatically added clusters, and application data is analyzed by interpreting the trained neural network as a fuzzy rule-based system. The learning vector quantization algorithm has been modified, acquiring the self-evolvement character in the prototype neuron layer based on sub-Bayesian decision making. The number of required prototypes representing fuzzy rules is automatically determined by the application data set. This method, compared with others, shows better classification results for data sets with high noise or overlapping classification boundaries. The classifying radial basis function networks are generalized into multiple shape basis function networks. The learning algorithm discussed is capable of adding new neurons representing self-evolving clusters of different shapes and sizes dynamically. This shows a clear reduction in number of neurons or the number of fuzzy rules generated, and the classification accuracy is increased significantly. This improvement is highly relevant in developing neural networks that are functionally equivalent to fuzzy classifiers since the transparency is strongly related to the compactness of the system.","doi":"10.1109/78.650103","startPage":"2766","endPage":"2773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14188/00650103.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-evolving neural networks for rule-based data processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Data processing","Clustering algorithms","Neurons","Data analysis","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Prototypes","Shape","Knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","knowledge based systems","fuzzy neural nets","quantisation (signal)","feedforward neural nets","data analysis","Bayes methods","decision theory","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule-based data processing","training algorithms","self-evolving neural networks","rule-based data analysis","application data","trained neural network","fuzzy rule-based system","learning vector quantization algorithm","prototype neuron layer","subBayesian decision making","data sets","overlapping classification boundaries","radial basis function networks","multiple shape basis function networks","classification accuracy","fuzzy classifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Self-evolving neural networks for rule-based data processing","volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5765018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-evolving neural networks for rule-based data processing","sourcePdf":"00650103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028117S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","articleId":"650103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":650104,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, extracting this information automatically is quite difficult. It has been observed that certain structures present in the vibration patterns are correlated with dullness. We present an approach to extracting features present in these structures using self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs). We have modified the SOFM algorithm in order to improve its generalization abilities and to allow it to better serve as a preprocessor for a hidden Markov model (HMM) classifier. We also discuss the challenge of determining which classes exist in the machining application and introduce an algorithm for automatic clustering of time-sequence patterns using the HMM. We show the success of this algorithm in finding clusters that are beneficial to the machine-monitoring application.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14188/00650105.pdf","startPage":"2787","endPage":"2798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.650105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing feature maps and hidden Markov models for machine-tool monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Condition monitoring","Signal processing algorithms","Data mining","Feature extraction","Clustering algorithms","Machining","Machine tools","Refining","Manufacturing processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine tools","vibrations","acoustic signal processing","wear","self-organising feature maps","hidden Markov models","feature extraction","pattern classification","sequences","signal representation","time-frequency analysis","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing feature maps","hidden Markov models","machine tool monitoring","acoustic signal classification","industrial machine tools","cutting edges","wear","vibration patterns","dullness","feature extraction","modified SOFM algorithm","preprocessor","HMM classifier","machining application","automatic clustering","time-sequence patterns","time-frequency representations","wideband transient events"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing feature maps and hidden Markov models for machine-tool monitoring","volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5765020","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing feature maps and hidden Markov models for machine-tool monitoring","sourcePdf":"00650105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049587S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","articleId":"650105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":650106,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The associated learning algorithm is based on an extension of classical backpropagation and on the concept of virtual error. Such networks can be seen as an extension of ARIMA and ARARMA models and face the problem of nonstationary signal prediction.

This is particularly true for many infrared focal plane arrays. Thus, the resulting images may be severely aliased. This paper examines a technique for estimating a high-resolution image, with reduced aliasing, from a sequence of undersampled frames. Several approaches to this problem have been investigated previously. However, in this paper a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for jointly estimating image registration parameters and the high-resolution image is presented. Several previous approaches have relied on knowing the registration parameters a priori or have utilized registration techniques not specifically designed to treat severely aliased images. In the proposed method, the registration parameters are iteratively updated along with the high-resolution image in a cyclic coordinate-descent optimization procedure. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed MAP algorithm using both visible and infrared images. Quantitative error analysis is provided and several images are shown for subjective evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/83.650116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/14163/00650116.pdf","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.650116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint MAP registration and high-resolution image estimation using a sequence of undersampled images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Joint MAP registration and high-resolution image estimation using a sequence of undersampled images","volume":"6","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5778742","pubMedId":"18285233","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650116/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint MAP registration and high-resolution image estimation using a sequence of undersampled images","sourcePdf":"00650116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048901S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"570","articleId":"650116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650118,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper utilizes the above known tools to propose a unified methodology toward the more complicated problem of superresolution restoration. In the superresolution restoration problem, an improved resolution image is restored from several geometrically warped, blurred, noisy and downsampled measured images. The superresolution restoration problem is modeled and analyzed from the ML, the MAP, and POCS points of view, yielding a generalization of the known superresolution restoration methods. The proposed restoration approach is general but assumes explicit knowledge of the linear space- and time-variant blur, the (additive Gaussian) noise, the different measured resolutions, and the (smooth) motion characteristics. A hybrid method combining the simplicity of the ML and the incorporation of nonellipsoid constraints is presented, giving improved restoration performance, compared with the ML and the POCS approaches. The hybrid method is shown to converge to the unique optimal solution of a new definition of the optimization problem. Superresolution restoration from motionless measurements is also discussed. Simulations demonstrate the power of the proposed methodology.","doi":"10.1109/83.650118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.650118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/14163/00650118.pdf","startPage":"1646","endPage":"1658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoration of a single superresolution image from several blurred, noisy, and undersampled measured images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Restoration of a single superresolution image from several blurred, noisy, and undersampled measured images","volume":"6","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5778744","pubMedId":"18285235","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoration of a single superresolution image from several blurred, noisy, and undersampled measured images","sourcePdf":"00650118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033129S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"709","articleId":"650118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650120,"authors":[{"name":"I.J.

We advocate that a watermark should be constructed as an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random vector that is imperceptibly inserted in a spread-spectrum-like fashion into the perceptually most significant spectral components of the data. We argue that insertion of a watermark under this regime makes the watermark robust to signal processing operations (such as lossy compression, filtering, digital-analog and analog-digital conversion, requantization, etc.), and common geometric transformations (such as cropping, scaling, translation, and rotation) provided that the original image is available and that it can be successfully registered against the transformed watermarked image. In these cases, the watermark detector unambiguously identifies the owner. Further, the use of Gaussian noise, ensures strong resilience to multiple-document, or collusional, attacks. Experimental results are provided to support these claims, along with an exposition of pending open problems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.650120","doi":"10.1109/83.650120","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/14163/00650120.pdf","startPage":"1673","endPage":"1687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure spread spectrum watermarking for multimedia","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure spread spectrum watermarking for multimedia","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5778746","pubMedId":"18285237","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure spread spectrum watermarking for multimedia","sourcePdf":"00650120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043581S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"3396","articleId":"650120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650125,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

The application of these materials in microelectronics and micromachining dictates the use of different polymers than those previously used for conventional plastic magnets due to fabrication compatibility constraints. The material investigated here consists of magnetically anisotropic strontium ferrite particles suspended in a benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride-oxydianiline/metaphenylene diamine polyimide matrix. Magnetic mechanical, and processability properties of these composites are investigated for a strontium ferrite loading range of 55%-80% by volume. Intrinsic coercivity H/sub ci/ residual magnetic flux density B/sub r/ and maximum energy product (BH)/sub max/ have been determined. For an 80% by-volume concentration loading of ferrite, H/sub ci/ of 318 kA/m B/sub r/, approaching 0.3 T, and (BH)/sub max/ of 11900 T/spl middot/A/m have been achieved. Biaxial Young's modulus and residual stress are determined using a slightly modified in situ load/deflection technique. The biaxial Young's modulus increases with increasing the magnetic powder loading. The materials have been deposited and patterned using two techniques: (1) screen-printing and (2) spin-casting, followed by photolithography. Finally, a simple magnetic microactuator made with those materials has been fabricated and tested, which demonstrates the usefulness of those materials to micromachining.","doi":"10.1109/84.650127","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","startPage":"307","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/14164/00650127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.650127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic and mechanical properties of micromachined strontium ferrite/polyimide composites","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mechanical factors","Strontium","Magnetic materials","Magnetic anisotropy","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Magnetic flux","Ferrites","Micromachining","Polyimides","Plastic films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strontium compounds","ferrites","magnetic thin films","polymer films","filled polymers","particle reinforced composites","micromachining","microactuators","mechanical properties","Young's modulus","magnetic particles","coercive force","magnetic flux","photolithography","materials preparation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic properties","mechanical properties","micromachined Sr ferrite/polyimide composites","composite thin films","micromachining applications","magnetically anisotropic Sr ferrite particles","processability properties","intrinsic coercivity","residual magnetic flux density","biaxial Young modulus","residual stress","in situ load/deflection technique","magnetic powder loading","screen-printing","spin-casting","photolithography","magnetic microactuator","0.3 T","SrFe/sub 12/O/sub 19/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic and mechanical properties of micromachined strontium ferrite/polyimide composites","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5785225","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650127/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic and mechanical properties of micromachined strontium ferrite/polyimide composites","sourcePdf":"00650127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056926S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"71","articleId":"650127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650129,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

To validate the system, vibration measurements have been carried on two structures-a micromachined silicon cantilever and bridge-and the results are presented. Out-of-plane measurements show that for the cantilever, both the mode shapes and resonant frequencies agree with beam theory predictions. However, for the bridge structure, tension due to boron doping causes a change from beam-like behavior and a more complex model is required. Mode-shapes natural frequencies and modal damping are determined from data obtained by vibrating the structures using a piezoelectric mounting system and deriving the transfer function between the piezodrive voltage and beam vibrational velocity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","volume":"6","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5785227","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A system for the dynamic characterization of microstructures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A system for the dynamic characterization of microstructures","sourcePdf":"00650129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0463S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"79","articleId":"650129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":650131,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This traffic is hard to manage because it has strict delay and loss requirements while simultaneously exhibiting burstiness at multiple time scales. We show that burstiness over long time scales, in conjunction with resource reservation using one-shot traffic descriptors, can substantially degrade the loss rate, end-to-end delay, and statistical multiplexing gain of a connection. We use large-deviation theory to model the performance of multiple time-scale traffic and to motivate the design of renegotiated constant bit rate (RCBR) service. Sources using RCBR service are presented with an abstraction of a fixed-size buffer which is drained at a constant rate. They may renegotiate the drain rate to match their workload. Because all traffic entering the network is constant bit-rate (CBR), RCBR requires minimal buffering and scheduling support in switches. We show that the service is suitable for both stored and online video sources. An RCBR source must decide when to renegotiate its service rate and what the new service rate should be. We present: (1) an algorithm to compute the optimal renegotiation schedule for stored (offline) traffic and (2) a heuristic to approximate the optimal schedule for online traffic. We also discuss measurement-based admission control (MBAC) for RCBR traffic. Simulation experiments show that RCBR is able to extract almost all of the statistical multiplexing gain available by exploiting slow time-scale variations in traffic. Moreover, simple admission control schemes are sufficient to keep the renegotiation failure probability below a small threshold while still offering high link utilization. Thus, we believe that RCBR is a simple, practical, and effective service for carrying multiple time-scale traffic.","doi":"10.1109/90.650136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/14085/00650136.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.650136","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"741","endPage":"755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RCBR: a simple and efficient service for multiple time-scale traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"RCBR: a simple and efficient service for multiple time-scale traffic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650136/","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5827707","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RCBR: a simple and efficient service for multiple time-scale traffic","sourcePdf":"00650136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07232S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"172","articleId":"650136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":650137,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also suffer from significant losses due to bit errors and handoffs. TCP responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to end performance in wireless and lossy systems. We compare several schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks. We classify these schemes into three broad categories: end-to-end protocols, where loss recovery is performed by the sender; link-layer protocols that provide local reliability; and split-connection protocols that break the end-to-end connection into two parts at the base station. We present the results of several experiments performed in both LAN and WAN environments, using throughput and goodput as the metrics for comparison. Our results show that a reliable link-layer protocol that is TCP-aware provides very good performance. Furthermore, it is possible to achieve good performance without splitting the end-to-end connection at the base station. We also demonstrate that selective acknowledgments and explicit loss notifications result in significant performance improvements.","doi":"10.1109/90.650137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.650137","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/14085/00650137.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of mechanisms for improving TCP performance over wireless links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of mechanisms for improving TCP performance over wireless links","volume":"5","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5827708","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of mechanisms for improving TCP performance over wireless links","sourcePdf":"00650137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034928S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"783","articleId":"650137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650138,"authors":[{"name":"E.W.

A variety of graphs are found in the literature, including fixed topologies such as rings or stars, \"well-known\" topologies such as the ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. While many researchers rely upon graphs for analytic and simulation studies, there has been little analysis of the implications of using a particular model or how the graph generation method may affect the results of such studies. Further, the selection of one generation method over another is often arbitrary, since the differences and similarities between methods are not well understood. This paper considers the problem of generating and selecting graphs that reflect the properties of real internetworks. We review generation methods in common use and also propose several new methods. We consider a set of metrics that characterize the graphs produced by a method, and we quantify similarities and differences among several generation methods with respect to these metrics. We also consider the effect of the graph model in the context of a specific problem, namely multicast routing.","doi":"10.1109/90.650138","startPage":"770","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/14085/00650138.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.650138","endPage":"783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quantitative comparison of graph-based models for Internet topology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A quantitative comparison of graph-based models for Internet topology","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5827709","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantitative comparison of graph-based models for Internet topology","sourcePdf":"00650138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036105S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"296","articleId":"650138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":650143,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

We show evidence that the subset of network traffic that is due to World Wide Web (WWW) transfers can show characteristics that are consistent with self-similarity, and we present a hypothesized explanation for that self-similarity. Using a set of traces of actual user executions of NCSA Mosaic, we examine the dependence structure of WWW traffic. First, we show evidence that WWW traffic exhibits behavior that is consistent with self-similar traffic models. Then we show that the self-similarity in such traffic can be explained based on the underlying distributions of WWW document sizes, the effects of caching and user preference in file transfer, the effect of user \"think time\", and the superimposition of many such transfers in a local-area network. To do this, we rely on empirically measured distributions both from client traces and from data independently collected at WWW servers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web sites","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","World Wide Web","Local area networks","Internet","Intelligent networks","Network servers","Web server","Tail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","wide area networks","local area networks","telecommunication traffic","performance evaluation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["World Wide Web traffic","self-similarity","wide-area network","local-area network","LAN traffic","WAN traffic","NCSA Mosaic","dependence structure","WWW traffic","self-similar traffic models","WWW document size distribution","caching","user preference","file transfer","user think time","empirically measured distributions","client traces","WWW servers","statistical tests"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650143","doi":"10.1109/90.650143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/14085/00650143.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.650143","startPage":"835","endPage":"846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14085","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-similarity in World Wide Web traffic: evidence and possible causes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Self-similarity in World Wide Web traffic: evidence and possible causes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5827714","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-similarity in World Wide Web traffic: evidence and possible causes","sourcePdf":"00650143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032861S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"1646","articleId":"650143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650148,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The optical network provides reconfigurable connections that can be used to carry different types of data, at possibly different bit rates. A connection consists of a path in the network and a wavelength on each link in that path. This work focuses on the mechanisms for controlling the optical connections. Distributed control protocols are provided for setting up and taking down connections reliably. These protocols allow connection originators to obtain resources with high probability by minimizing reservation conflicts, allow connections to stay up even if controllers along the path in the network fail, ensure that controllers in the network have a consistent view of the state of each connection, and ensure that all resources taken up by a connection are released once the connection is taken down. Fast protocols are also proposed for handling link failures and wavelength failures on a link. These protocols are general in that they can be used in networks with: (1) different kinds of node architectures (electrical/optical switching, with or without wavelength conversion, etc.), (2) different route-computation algorithms that reflect the underlying constraints imposed by the nodes and the physical layer, and (3) any kind of underlying mechanism using which the network controllers can communicate with each other.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.650151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14085","startPage":"936","endPage":"943","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/14085/00650151.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed network control for optical networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed network control for optical networks","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5827722","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed network control for optical networks","sourcePdf":"00650151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017558S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"72","articleId":"650151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":650160,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The algorithm belongs to the Bug family, which combines local planning with global information that guarantees convergence. Most Bug-type algorithms use contact sensors and consist of two reactive modes of motion: moving toward the target between obstacles and following obstacle boundaries, DistBug uses range data in a new \"leaving condition\" which allows the robot to abandon obstacle boundaries as soon as global convergence is guaranteed, based on the free range in the direction of the target. The leaving condition is tested directly on the sensor readings, thus making the algorithm simple to implement. To further improve performance, local information is utilized for choosing the boundary following direction, and a search manager is introduced for bounding the search area. The simulation results indicate a significant advantage of DistBug relative to the classical Bug2 algorithm. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a real robot, demonstrating the usefulness and applicability of our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5806286","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sensory-based motion planning with global proofs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensory-based motion planning with global proofs","sourcePdf":"00650160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040493S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"147","articleId":"650160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":650169,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

We use these techniques in a system that operates with little or no a priori knowledge of object- and camera-related parameters to robustly determine such object-related parameters as velocity and depth. Such determination of extrinsic environmental parameters is essential for performing higher level tasks such as inspection, exploration, tracking, grasping, and collision-free motion planning.

First we summarize the requirements and elements of such an infrastructure and introduce a networking model that is framed into four layers: interconnection (bearer), internetworking, interoperability (middleware), and application. Then, we offer a review of the classical telecommunications networking model, the current status of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) multimedia networking features, and the ongoing activities for fostering evolution of telecommunications networks to enhance control, management, and service delivery. An overview of the current Internet network architecture follows, presenting the recent achievements and the evolving networking protocols to cope with real-time multimedia applications. As described in this paper, the schemes for integrating Internet protocols (IPs) and ATM resource reservation protocols, which address an efficient resource utilization and quality of service guarantee in broadband networks, fall into the first two lower architectural layers, which are the foundation of network computing and communications services. In particular, we present a summary description of the comparative features of both IP and ATM protocol approaches, and we report on current proposals for provisioning IP on ATM networks. Last, we discuss trends in middleware services, including the emerging technology of transportable computation and intelligent agents. Interoperability of heterogeneous networked systems is based on an agreed distributed application encoding and computation environment, thus pushing the key capability of the layered networking architecture up into the middleware layer.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.650174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14184","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1914","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/14184/00650174.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence of telecommunications and computing to networking models for integrated services and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Convergence of telecommunications and computing to networking models for integrated services and applications","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5814440","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"85","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of telecommunications and computing to networking models for integrated services and applications","sourcePdf":"00650174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10867S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"19","articleId":"650174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":650178,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the short term, solutions such as x-digital subscriber line (DSL) and hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC), allowing the reuse of existing infrastructures look very promising. For the longer term, new infrastructures based either on radio or on optical access links seem preferable. Three x-DSL techniques aiming at high-bit-rate transmission over twisted pairs are presented: high-bit-rate DSL, asymmetrical DSL, and very-high-bit-rate DSL. An extension of existing cable television networks known as HFC is also described. Two other prospective approaches, wireless in the loop (WITL) and fiber in the loop (FITL), are then presented. Several techniques are considered for WITL: digital enhanced cordless telecommunication local multipoint distribution service, wireless ATM, and low Earth orbit satellite constellations. The various architectural alternatives for the FITL approach are discussed, a special interest being dedicated to the synchronous digital hierarchy self-healing loop and the ATM over a passive optical network.

This method, which employs the dyadic Green's function in the derivation of the EM radiated fields, makes the analysis more general, compact, and straightforward than those two methods published recently by Werner (1996) and Overfelt (1996). Both near and far zones are considered so that the EM radiated fields are expressed in terms of the vector-wave eigenfunctions. Not only the exact solution of the EM fields in the near and far zones outside the region (where r>a) is derived by the use of the spherical Hankel function of the first kind, but also the closed-series form of the EM fields radiated in the near zone inside the region 0/spl les/r<a is obtained in series of the spherical Bessel functions of the first kind. As an example, a Fourier cosine series is used to expand an arbitrary current distribution along the loop and the exact representations of the EM radiated fields due to the loop everywhere are obtained in closed form. The closed form reduces to those for the sinusoidal current loop and further for the uniform current loop. Validity of the approximate formulas is discussed and clarified. Error analysis based on numerical computations of the radiated fields is also given to show the accuracy of the limiting cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650191/","volume":"45","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804507","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Exact solutions of electromagnetic fields in both near and far zones radiated by thin circular-loop antennas: a general representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact solutions of electromagnetic fields in both near and far zones radiated by thin circular-loop antennas: a general representation","sourcePdf":"00650191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03634S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"57","articleId":"650191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":650196,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Although the positional inhomogeneity of structures gives rise to some variation from one measured position to another, these positional variabilities are not large. The overall trend of reflection coefficients calculated by multilayer dielectric models thus agrees fairly well with the trend of the measurements. We have shown that the use of circular polarization can reduce the reflection even if the interior parts of the structure have complicated structures. In addition, the shadowing effects of several types of partitions were measured. The transmission coefficients of partitions depend on the materials. The transmission losses of plywood-made partitions are found to be fairly low.","doi":"10.1109/8.650196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1783","endPage":"1792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.650196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14180","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/14180/00650196.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric measurements","Nonhomogeneous media","Fresnel reflection","Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave propagation","Floors","Refractive index","Buildings","Indium tin oxide","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave propagation","electromagnetic wave transmission","electromagnetic wave reflection","electromagnetic wave polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflection characteristics","transmission characteristics","interior structures","office building","walls","floor","ceiling","window","partitions","multilayer dielectric models","positional inhomogeneity","positional variabilities","circular polarization","shadowing effects","transmission coefficients","transmission losses","plywood-made partitions","wireless LAN","60 GHz","57.5 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measurements of reflection and transmission characteristics of interior structures of office building in the 60-GHz band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650196/","volume":"45","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"5804511","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements of reflection and transmission characteristics of interior structures of office building in the 60-GHz band","sourcePdf":"00650196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033651S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"94","articleId":"650196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":650199,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The stochastic optimization algorithm used is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) which operates on a discretized form of the parameter space and searches globally for the optimum point. In this process, it is assumed that the polarimetric responses of the targets are known a priori. The optimization algorithm is applied to two sets of data: (1) a synthetic backscatter data for four point targets with similar radar cross sections (RCSs) and (2) a set of polarimetric backscatter measurements of asphalt surfaces under different physical conditions at 94 GHz. The purpose of the latter study is to come up with the optimal design for polarization states of an affordable millimeter-wave radar sensor that can assess traction of road surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/8.650199","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/14180/00650199.pdf","startPage":"1810","endPage":"1817","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.650199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of optimum polarization for multiple target discrimination using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of optimum polarization for multiple target discrimination using genetic algorithms","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5804514","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of optimum polarization for multiple target discrimination using genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00650199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04106S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","articleId":"650199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":650202,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

It is found that staircasing errors are small when the staircase diagonal (the hypotenuse of the right triangle created by the stairstep) is smaller than half a wavelength at the highest significant frequency in the excitation. This rule-of-thumb is put forward as a necessary condition for the discretization of general problems. Results are also provided for some simple FDTD schemes that are designed to reduce staircasing errors. By using large aspect-ratio cells, a grid can be constructed that satisfies the rule-of-thumb given above. While this approach eliminates general staircasing errors, some errors persist owing to the presence of step discontinuities immediately adjacent to the horn feed. These errors can be further reduced by using a cell-splitting approach. It is shown that the contour path FDTD technique can be used to eliminate nearly all staircasing errors, while some additional improvement is shown to be provided by using a stabilized contour path FDTD approach. Finally, a recently proposed conformal technique that permits simple implementation is shown to provide results comparable with those of the stabilized contour path approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/14180/00650202.pdf","startPage":"1830","endPage":"1838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.650202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.650202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD simulations of TEM horns and the implications for staircased representations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Feeds","Two dimensional displays","Frequency","Error analysis","Computer errors","Voltage","Conductors","Horn antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","horn antennas","antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD simulations","2D TEM horns","staircased representations","modelling","finite-difference time-domain method","boundary walls","perfect electric conductors","analytic solution","staircasing errors","staircase diagonal","discretization","large aspect-ratio cells","step discontinuities","horn feed","cell-splitting approach","contour path FDTD technique","conformal technique","horn antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"FDTD simulations of TEM horns and the implications for staircased representations","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804517","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD simulations of TEM horns and the implications for staircased representations","sourcePdf":"00650202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037642S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"21","articleId":"650202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650219,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We focus on the adaptive suppression method proposed by Honig, Madhow and Verdti (see IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.41, p.944-960, 1995) for wide-band interference, applying it to a narrow-band interferer. We identify the eigenspaces of the system dynamics to analyze the convergence of the adaptive version of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm for this application. Using this subspace approach we are able to: (1) significantly decrease the convergence times via a new constraint on the step size in adaptation; (2) introduce a simple parameterization of the mean output energy (MOE) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) to compare performance of various receivers; and (3) identify modes of operation where the algorithm will cease to effectively cancel interference. We propose a new adaptive receiver that avoids the convergence anomalies identified, while capitalizing on the new step size for faster convergence. Simulation results to support theoretical results are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14182/00650236.pdf","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.650236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.650236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A subspace approach to adaptive narrow-band interference suppression in DSSS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Convergence","Spread spectrum communication","Wideband","Algorithm design and analysis","Mean square error methods","Interference constraints","Subspace constraints","Signal processing","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","adaptive signal processing","radio receivers","least mean squares methods","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","convergence of numerical methods","code division multiple access","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace approach","adaptive narrow-band interference suppression","DSSS communications","digital narrow-band interferer","direct-sequence spread spectrum","adaptive suppression method","eigenspaces","system dynamics","minimum mean square error algorithm","convergence times reduction","step size constraint","mean output energy","signal-to-interference ratio","receiver performance","adaptive receiver","simulation results","personal communications services","CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A subspace approach to adaptive narrow-band interference suppression in DSSS","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804758","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A subspace approach to adaptive narrow-band interference suppression in DSSS","sourcePdf":"00650236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04494S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","articleId":"650236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650237,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The natural outcome is the emergence of a new class of linear scalar-parameterized auxiliary-vector receivers (filters). Then, the blind optimization of these receivers in the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) sense becomes a straightforward procedure. The conceptual and computational simplicity of this general approach promises immediate practical utility. This new generation of receivers exhibits minimal optimization requirements and near-matched-filter (MF) operational complexity.

Both slotted DS/SSMA ALOHA with and without forward error correction (FEC) are considered. For the case with FEC, maximum-likelihood decoding with code combining is used. Code combining allows for the combination of multiple copies of the same packet (which are typically discarded), to obtain a lower code rate for that specific packet, and therefore an improved probability of successful decoding. In both cases, combining multiple copies of the same packet results in a throughput which is an increasing function over a broad range of offered load, so that the system is more reliable from the point of view of stability. In addition, combining provides a higher throughput and a smaller time delay for packet transmission. This is illustrated by means of analytical and simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/26.650239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14182/00650239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.650239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14182","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-likelihood decoding and code combining for DS/SSMA slotted ALOHA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-likelihood decoding and code combining for DS/SSMA slotted ALOHA","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804761","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-likelihood decoding and code combining for DS/SSMA slotted ALOHA","sourcePdf":"00650239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10661S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","articleId":"650239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":650240,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

The overlapping nature of such waveforms in time and frequency provides a capacity improvement over the commonly used frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM) schemes while their orthogonality properties ensure that the overlapping message signals can be separated by a simple correlator receiver. The interference caused by timing offset in transmission is examined. A design procedure that exploits the inherent degrees of freedom in the WPDM structure to mitigate the effects of timing error is introduced, and a waveform that minimizes the energy of the timing error interference is designed. An expression for the probability of error due to the presence of Gaussian noise and timing error for the transmission of binary data is derived. The performance advantages of the designed waveform over standard wavelet packet basis functions are demonstrated by both analytical and simulation methods. The capacity improvement of WPDM, its simple implementation, and the possibility of having optimum waveform designs indicate that WPDM holds considerable promise as a multiple signal transmission technique.","doi":"10.1109/78.650245","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14183/00650245.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2877","endPage":"2890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet packet division multiplexing and wavelet packet design under timing error effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet packet division multiplexing and wavelet packet design under timing error effects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650245/","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5792267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet packet division multiplexing and wavelet packet design under timing error effects","sourcePdf":"00650245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029529S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"76","articleId":"650245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":650249,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Miranda","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Escola Polit\u00e9cnica, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Miranda","id":"37275969600"},{"name":"M.

The new algorithm is based on a priori prediction errors normalized by the a posteriori prediction error energy-as suggested by the interpretation of the system matrix-and uses the fact that the latter quantities can be computed via a lattice structure. Backward consistency and backward stability become guaranteed under simple numerical conventions. In contrast with the known a posteriori QR-LSL algorithm, the new algorithm present; fewer numerical complexity, and backward consistency is guaranteed without the constraint of passive rotations in the recursive lattice section. Furthermore, reordering of some operations results in a version with identical numerical behavior and inherent parallelism that can be exploited for fast implementations. Both a priori and a posteriori QR-LSL algorithms are compared by means of simulations. For small mantissa wordlengths and forgetting factors /spl lambda/ not too close to 1, the proposed algorithm performs better due to dispensing with passive rotations. For forgetting factors very close to one and small wordlengths, both algorithms are sensitive to the accuracy of some well-identified computations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid least squares QR-lattice algorithm using a priori errors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.650249","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14183/00650249.pdf","startPage":"2900","endPage":"2911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid least squares QR-lattice algorithm using a priori errors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5792270","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid least squares QR-lattice algorithm using a priori errors","sourcePdf":"00650249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074317S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","articleId":"650249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":650250,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The performance of this algorithm is examined for scattering data with and without additive noise.","doi":"10.1109/78.650250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14183/00650250.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14183","startPage":"2912","endPage":"2927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching pursuits with a wave-based dictionary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Matching pursuits with a wave-based dictionary","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5792271","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching pursuits with a wave-based dictionary","sourcePdf":"00650250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06476S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","articleId":"650250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":650255,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The system can be designed to perform a projection of f(x) onto the reconstruction subspace V(/spl phi/)=span {/spl phi/(x-k)}/sub k/spl epsiv/Z/; for example, the family of bandlimited signals with /spl phi/(x)=sinc(x). This implies that the reconstruction will be perfect when the input signal is included in V(/spl phi/): the traditional framework of Papoulis' (1977) generalized sampling theory. Otherwise, one recovers a signal approximation f(x)/spl epsiv/V(/spl phi/) that is consistent with f(x) in the sense that it produces the same measurements. To characterize the stability of the algorithm, we prove that the dual synthesis functions that appear in the generalized sampling reconstruction formula constitute a Riesz basis of V(/spl phi/), and we use the corresponding Riesz bounds to define the condition number of the system. We then use these results to analyze the stability of various instances of interlaced and derivative sampling. Next, we consider the issue of performance, which becomes pertinent once we have extended the applicability of the method to arbitrary input functions, that is, when /spl Hscr/ is considerably larger than V(/spl phi/), and the reconstruction is no longer exact. We show that the generalized sampling solution is essentially equivalent to the optimal minimum error approximation. We then perform a detailed analysis for the case in which the analysis filters are in L/sub 2/ and determine all relevant bound constants explicitly. Finally, we use an interlaced sampling example to illustrate these various calculations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized sampling: stability and performance analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.650255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14183/00650255.pdf","startPage":"2941","endPage":"2950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Generalized sampling: stability and performance analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5799074","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized sampling: stability and performance analysis","sourcePdf":"00650255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029139S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","articleId":"650255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650256,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm presented in this paper exploits the fact that the set of bandlimited signals that are also essentially time-limited is approximated well by a low-dimensional linear subspace. This fact, which is well known for one-dimensional (1-D) signals with contiguous passbands and time-concentration intervals, is established for a more general class of multidimensional (m-D) signals with discontiguous passbands and discontiguous time-concentration regions. A criterion is presented for determining the dimension of the approximating subspace and the minimax optimal subspace itself based on knowledge of the passband, time-concentration regions, energy concentration factor, and bounds on the tolerable extrapolation error. The extrapolation is constrained to lie in this subspace, and parameters characterizing the extrapolation are obtained from the data by solving a linear system of equations. For certain sampling patterns, the system is ill conditioned, and a second rank reduction is needed to reduce the deleterious effects of observation noise and modeling error. A novel criterion for rank selection based on known bounds on noise power and modeling error is presented. The effectiveness of the new algorithm and the rank selection criterion are demonstrated by means of computer simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14183","startPage":"2951","endPage":"2966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14183/00650256.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandlimited extrapolation using time-bandwidth dimension","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bandlimited extrapolation using time-bandwidth dimension","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5792273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandlimited extrapolation using time-bandwidth dimension","sourcePdf":"00650256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062633S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","articleId":"650256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":650258,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In either case, the two observations correspond to the outputs of two channels excited by the same input. The channels are estimated using the theory of signal reconstruction from phase only. The phase used is the phase of the cross spectrum of the observations filtered through their minimum phase equivalent filters. We provide an analytical study of the propagation of noise effects in the phase estimate. Comparisons with existing methods indicate that the proposed approach is robust to noise and, at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leads to significantly smaller channel estimation errors. Besides robustness to noise, the proposed method does not require knowledge of channel lengths, which are determined via an iterative procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","volume":"45","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"5792275","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cross-spectrum based blind channel identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-spectrum based blind channel identification","sourcePdf":"00650258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047915S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","articleId":"650258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":650264,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zhi Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"650264","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Blind equalizers","Prediction algorithms","Robustness","Digital TV","Higher order statistics","Mobile communication","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error analysis","matrix decomposition","telecommunication channels","identification","statistical analysis","prediction theory","digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix outer-product decomposition method","blind multiple channel identification","equalization","mobile communications","digital TV systems","second-order statistics","multichannel parameter estimation","single-user systems","multiple-user systems","linear prediction algorithm","channel estimates","overmodeling errors","channel order estimates","performance"]}],"abstract":"Blind channel identification and equalization have attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential application in mobile communications and digital TV systems.

Examples of such channels include almost periodically varying ones (Fourier series description) or channels locally modeled by a truncated Taylor series or by a wavelet expansion. It is shown that the estimation of the expansion parameters is equivalent to estimating the second-order parameters of an unobservable FIR single-input-many-output (SIMO) process, which are directly computed (under some assumptions) from the observation data. By exploiting this equivalence, a number of different blind subspace methods are applicable, which have been originally developed in the context of time-invariant SIMO systems.

I,Q adaptive weighting removes many of the deleterious effects of I,Q quadrature detection imbalance, which can severely limit the adaptive matched filter (AMF) performance. However, for the I,Q AMF, the unknown desired signal's initial phase complicates the design procedure and even for a reasonable design criterion, the AMF performance can fluctuate significantly as a function of this phase. An I,Q AMF technique whose performance is almost phase invariant is developed, and example of its utility is shown.","doi":"10.1109/78.650274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"3104","endPage":"3107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.650274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14183","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14183/00650274.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Adaptive filters","Noise cancellation","Signal to noise ratio","Signal design","Detectors","Oscillators","Filtering","Phase detection","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receivers","adaptive filters","matched filters","error compensation","correlation methods","noise","interference suppression","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive matched filter","I,Q mismatch errors","complex-valued inputs","desired signal","correlated external noise","receiver","adaptive weighting","quadrature detection imbalance","AMF performance","design procedure","phase invariance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive matched filter that compensates for I,Q mismatch errors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650274/","volume":"45","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"5792287","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive matched filter that compensates for I,Q mismatch errors","sourcePdf":"00650274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046619S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"650274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":650279,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Delay in achieving foot flat contact with the floor causes a prolonged period of heel only support and results in an unstable base of support for those persons with transtibial amputations. The purpose of this study was to identify mechanical causes of instability during weight acceptance with three different prosthetic foot designs, Single Axis, Seattle Lightfoot, and Flex Foot. Ten male individuals with transtibial amputations were tested on three separate occasions wearing each prosthetic foot. A comparison group of ten individuals without transtibial amputations was also examined. Mean free walking speed was significantly slower for those with transtibial amputations regardless of the prosthetic foot worn (p<0.05). Contralateral toe off times were significantly later for each prosthetic foot (p<0.01). The timing of peak knee flexion was found to be significantly later than normal for each prosthetic foot (p<0.01). To minimize the impact of initial floor contact, persons with an intact limb used rapid plantar flexion, followed by a slower lowering of the foot to the floor. Dorsiflexion then stimulated knee flexion and foot flat. Two altered functions were found for all three prosthetic feet, reduced knee flexion and prolonged heel only support, Diminished knee flexion reflected delayed dorsiflexion and tibial advancement as a result of the cushioned heel. Lateness in reaching foot flat was also found. To improve the walking abilities of those persons with transtibial amputations, prosthetic foot designs need to incorporate mechanisms which promote early foot flat while preserving limb stability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Foot","Legged locomotion","Knee","Costs","Electric shock","Delay","Stability","Testing","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial limbs","biomechanics","mechanical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prosthetic weight acceptance mechanics","transtibial amputees","Single Axis","Seattle Lite","Flex Foot","loading response","floor contact shock absorption","heel only support","unstable support base","mean free walking speed","peak knee flexion timing","limb stability preservation","dorsiflexion"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Aged","Amputees","Ankle Joint","Artificial Limbs","Biomechanical Phenomena","Female","Foot","Gait","Humans","Joint Instability","Knee Joint","Leg","Male","Middle Aged","Range of Motion, Articular"]}],"doi":"10.1109/86.650279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/14167/00650279.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.650279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prosthetic weight acceptance mechanics in transtibial amputees wearing the Single Axis, Seattle Lite, and Flex Foot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Prosthetic weight acceptance mechanics in transtibial amputees wearing the Single Axis, Seattle Lite, and Flex Foot","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650279/","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5807390","pubMedId":"9422453","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prosthetic weight acceptance mechanics in transtibial amputees wearing the Single Axis, Seattle Lite, and Flex Foot","sourcePdf":"00650279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037845S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"51","articleId":"650279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":650285,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This instrument simultaneously estimates the ground reaction force resultants (vertical and shear forces, free moment and location of the center of pressure), pressure distribution throughout the foot-floor contact area, the trajectory of the center of pressure superimposed on the contact area (footprint). On the basis of the readings provided by the force plate the authors calibrated pressure sensors more accurately. They could therefore accurately estimate the vertical local components of the ground reaction. This information and the measured shear force resultants were essential for computing the shear forces acting on elementary areas corresponding to the active surface of each pressure sensor. This, in turn, allowed the authors to estimate the vertical and shear force resultants and free moment for subareas of the foot. This is a feature peculiar to this compound instrument, and for its effective exploitation the authors have implemented a few methods for the reliable identification of the subareas of interest.

Here, the authors extend the design of the controllers to a nested-loop LQG (linear quadratic Gaussian) stimulation controller which has ankle moment feedback (inner loops) and inverted pendulum angle feedback (outer loop). Each control loop is tuned by two parameters, the control weighting and an observer rise-time, which together determine the behavior.

Requisite to prediction of forces and moments is a detailed understanding of effective moment arms throughout the knee range-of-motion (ROM). Existing muscle models for the knee are based upon limited static studies of only a few preserved specimens. The objectives of this report are to develop a comprehensive description of muscle-tendon moment arms for the normal knee and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-minus knee during flexion-extension motion. Recent research results describe two nonorthogonal, nonintersecting axes of motion for the knee-one describing flexion-extension (FE) and the other longitudinal rotation (LR, equivalent to internal-external rotation). The effective flexion-extension moment arms of the muscles crossing the knee were developed with respect to the FE axis in 15 fresh, hemi-pelvis cadaver specimens. The normal moment arms for each of 13 muscles plus the patellar tendon exhibited variable, yet repeatable and recognizable patterns throughout the ROM. For most muscles there was no significant difference between the normal and ACL-minus moment arms. The results provide a basis for more accurate predictions of joint reaction forces and moments as well as useful knowledge for practitioners and therapists to assist in the assessment of muscle balance at the knee following injury, repair, and throughout rehabilitation.","doi":"10.1109/86.650292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","startPage":"367","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.650292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14167","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/14167/00650292.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Muscles","Arm","Knee","Read only memory","Iron","Internal stresses","Ligaments","Cadaver","Tendons","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["muscle","biomechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knee muscle balance","moment arms","normal knee","ACL-minus knee","muscle forces","loading factors","segmental position","load carried","mechanical advantage","muscle-tendon units","knee range-of-motion","preserved specimens","anterior cruciate ligament","longitudinal rotation","fresh hemipelvis cadaver specimens"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Aged","Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries","Biomechanical Phenomena","Female","Humans","Knee Injuries","Knee Joint","Male","Middle Aged","Movement","Muscle, Skeletal","Range of Motion, Articular","Tendons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Muscle balance at the knee-moment arms for the normal knee and the ACL-minus knee","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650292/","volume":"5","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5807399","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"9422462","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Muscle balance at the knee-moment arms for the normal knee and the ACL-minus knee","sourcePdf":"00650292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067204S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"103","articleId":"650292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":650311,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

First, an RNN is employed to discriminate each input frame for the three broad classes of initial, final, and silence. A finite state machine (FSM) is then used to classify the input frame into four states including three stable states of initial (I), final (F), and silence (S), and a transient (T) state. The decision is made based on examining whether the RNN discriminates well between classes. We then restrict the search space for the three stable states in the following DP search to speed up the recognition process. The efficiency of the proposed scheme was examined by simulations in which we incorporate it with a hidden Markov model-based (HMM-based) continuous 411 Mandarin based-syllables recognizer. The experimental results showed that it can be used in conjunction with the beam search to greatly reduce the computational complexity of the HMM recognizer while keeping the recognition rate almost undegraded.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5807383","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An RNN-based preclassification method for fast continuous Mandarin speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An RNN-based preclassification method for fast continuous Mandarin speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00650315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032476S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"14","articleId":"650315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":650316,"authors":[{"name":"H.

I. A unified formulation","abstract":"In optimization, multiple objectives and constraints cannot be handled independently of the underlying optimizer. Requirements such as continuity and differentiability of the cost surface add yet another conflicting element to the decision process. While \"better\" solutions should be rated higher than \"worse\" ones, the resulting cost landscape must also comply with such requirements. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which have found application in many areas not amenable to optimization by other methods, possess many characteristics desirable in a multiobjective optimizer, most notably the concerted handling of multiple candidate solutions. However, EAs are essentially unconstrained search techniques which require the assignment of a scalar measure of quality, or fitness, to such candidate solutions. After reviewing current revolutionary approaches to multiobjective and constrained optimization, the paper proposes that fitness assignment be interpreted as, or at least related to, a multicriterion decision process. A suitable decision making framework based on goals and priorities is subsequently formulated in terms of a relational operator, characterized, and shown to encompass a number of simpler decision strategies. Finally, the ranking of an arbitrary number of candidates is considered. The effect of preference changes on the cost surface seen by an EA is illustrated graphically for a simple problem. The paper concludes with the formulation of a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on the proposed decision strategy. Niche formation techniques are used to promote diversity among preferable candidates, and progressive articulation of preferences is shown to be possible as long as the genetic algorithm can recover from abrupt changes in the cost landscape.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650319/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","volume":"28","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5803757","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization and multiple constraint handling with evolutionary algorithms.

The evolutionary approach to multiple function optimization formulated in the first part of the paper is applied to the optimization of the low-pressure spool speed governor of a Pegasus gas turbine engine. This study illustrates how a technique such as the multiobjective genetic algorithm can be applied, and exemplifies how design requirements can be refined as the algorithm runs. Several objective functions and associated goals express design concerns in direct form, i.e., as the designer would state them. While such a designer-oriented formulation is very attractive, its practical usefulness depends heavily on the ability to search and optimize cost surfaces in a class much broader than usual, as already provided to a large extent by the genetic algorithm (GA). The two instances of the problem studied demonstrate the need for preference articulation in cases where many and highly competing objectives lead to a nondominated set too large for a finite population to sample effectively. It is shown that only a very small portion of the nondominated set is of practical relevance, which further substantiates the need to supply preference information to the GA. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results.","doi":"10.1109/3468.650320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel3/3468/14177/00650320.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3468.650320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization and multiple constraint handling with evolutionary algorithms.

As the levels of metallization increase, it becomes more difficult and expensive to delete deeply buried polysilicon lines. Ideally, metal fuses will be cut exclusively. However, to achieve reliable metal line cutting, a wide process window has to be found that can cut buried metal lines. The upper energy limit has previously been thought to result from excess laser energy absorbed by the substrate. We show that another failure mode exists at energies below the threshold to cause substrate damage directly. The same laser pulse which ejects the passivation and removes the metal is also likely to crack the dielectric material below the metal. Molten metal then fills the crack and maintains an electrical short circuit, preventing the line from being disconnected.","doi":"10.1109/55.650334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.650334","startPage":"4","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/55/14170/00650334.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laser energy limitation for buried metal cuts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Laser energy limitation for buried metal cuts","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5812239","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser energy limitation for buried metal cuts","sourcePdf":"00650334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035185S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"17","articleId":"650334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":650335,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.A. van der Wagt","affiliation":["Raytheon TI Systems, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"J.P.A.","lastName":"van der Wagt","id":"37373308100"},{"name":"A.C.

The method simultaneously regularizes the equations associated with all time points, and relies on a new theorem which states that a solution based on optimal regularization of each integral equation associated with each principal component of the data will be more accurate than a solution based on optimal regularization of each integral equation associated with each time point. The theorem is illustrated with simulations mimicking the complexity of the inverse electrocardiography problem. As must be expected from a method which imposes no additional a priori constraints, the new approach addresses uncorrelated noise only, and in the presence of dominating correlated noise it is only successful in producing a \"cleaner\" version of a necessarily compromised solution. Nevertheless, in principle, the new method is always preferred to the standard approach, since it (without penalty) eliminates pure noise that would otherwise be present in the solution estimate.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.650360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14181","startPage":"98","endPage":"104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14181/00650360.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved method for estimating epicardial potentials from the body surface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved method for estimating epicardial potentials from the body surface","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5804661","pubMedId":"9444844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved method for estimating epicardial potentials from the body surface","sourcePdf":"00650360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050591S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"108","articleId":"650360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650361,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The numerical methods classically used are founded either on nonlinear programming techniques (i.e., augmented Lagrangian, sequential quadratic programming) or on stochastic approaches which are more satisfactorily adapted to global optimum research (i.e., genetic algorithm, simulated annealing). However, the latter methods only guarantee reaching this global optimum with some probability. The present paper proposes a deterministic branch and bound algorithm associated with interval arithmetic which is then applied to the dimensioning of a slotless permanent magnet machine. The problem is formulated as a multiobjective-optimization problem with mixed variables. Original and unexpected results in this optimal design are obtained, and comparisons with previous works are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of electromechanical actuators: a new method based on global optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.650361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel3/20/14152/00650361.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.650361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of electromechanical actuators: a new method based on global optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5832228","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of electromechanical actuators: a new method based on global optimization","sourcePdf":"00650361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049155S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"60","articleId":"650361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650362,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

Challenges, such as motion-compensated beam steering, ensuring complete coverage and minimizing incidental photodamage, can be overcome with improved instrumentation. This paper presents core image processing algorithms for (1) rapid identification of branching and crossover points of the retinal vasculature; (2) automatic montaging of video retinal angiograms; (3) real-time location determination and tracking using a combination of feature-tagged point-matching and dynamic-pixel templates. These algorithms tradeoff conflicting needs for accuracy, robustness to image variations (due to movements and the difficulty of providing steady illumination) and noise, and operational speed in the context of available hardware. The algorithm for locating vasculature landmarks performed robustly at a speed of 16-30 video image frames/s depending upon the field on a Silicon Graphics workstation. The montaging algorithm performed at a speed of 1.6-4 s for merging 5-12 frames. The tracking algorithm was validated by manually locating six landmark points on an image sequence with 180 frames, demonstrating a mean-squared error of 1.35 pixels. It successfully detected and rejected instances when the image dimmed, faded, lost contrast, or lost focus.","doi":"10.1109/10.650362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14181/00650362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.650362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14181","startPage":"105","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image processing algorithms for retinal montage synthesis, mapping, and real-time location determination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image processing algorithms for retinal montage synthesis, mapping, and real-time location determination","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5804662","pubMedId":"9444845","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image processing algorithms for retinal montage synthesis, mapping, and real-time location determination","sourcePdf":"00650362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074387S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"58","articleId":"650362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650364,"authors":[{"name":"Han Wen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Han Wen","id":"37609226100"},{"name":"J.

MOSFET model generated for use in LIBRA simulation typically applies to only one bias point. The model and its parameters can be unphysical. It is desirable to establish a physical, scalable model capable of simulating both d.c. and r.f. characteristics and applicable to all the bias ranges. BSIM3 is a potential candidate, having demonstrated accuracy and scalability in the devices' d.c. characteristics. When it is applied to simulate the s-parameters at r.f., we find BSIM3 to be somewhat problematic and two modifications are necessary to obtain a good fit. The first modification involves the addition of a bulk resistive network, achievable with a simple circuit extension to the existing BSIM3 model. The second improvement accounts for the finite channel resistance, whose origin lies in a nonquasi-static analysis. Since BSIM3 employs a quasi-static assumption, this improvement, while important, involves some changes in the BSIM3 source code.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1997.650388","startPage":"309","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting.

The CVD W/PVD TiN gates without high temperature (>900 C) RTP anneal show good electrical characteristics on 3 nm gate oxide, and the CVD TiN is less favorable due to its high impurities. High temperature anneal cause fluorine in CVD W to diffuse and interact with the gate oxide which adversely affect the gate oxide integrity (GOI). The remote plasma nitrided gate oxide (RPNO) provides a barrier between the TiN and gate oxide, and thus prevents or reduces the F-SiO/sub 2/ interaction, resulting in metal gate GOI comparable to that of poly gate. The CVD metal gate is a good candidate for the non-conventional, high aspect ratio grooved gate structures due to its good conformality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of TiN processes for CVD W/TiN gate electrode on 3 nm gate oxide","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting.

successfully realized for the first time. The fabricated 1G SOI DRAM has fully compatible process with 0.17 /spl mu/m bulk CMOS technology except for the isolation process. The key advantage of BC-SOI MOSFET is freedom from the floating-body effect, since the body-potential increase can be suppressed by the well contact through the remaining thin-silicon film beneath the field oxide. The BC-SOI structure has several advantages, such as relatively high isolation punchthrough voltage, high drain-to-source breakdown voltage compared with conventional thin-film SOI MOSFETs and small junction capacitance compared with bulk MOSFETs, resulting in high-speed circuit operation.","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting.

Once a neutral O vacancy traps holes, it spontaneously changes to a large distorted structure. The distorted O vacancy can capture electrons, and remains as an electron trap in SiO/sub 2/ films. These results give a microscopic explanation for a trap model that is empirically deduced from experiments. The energy level of the generated electron trap exists near the band offset between the conduction band of SiO/sub 2/ and that of Si. From these results, the electron trap originating from a hole trapped O vacancy can be considered as one origin of the so-called stress-induced leakage currents in SiO/sub 2/ films.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1997.650480","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting.

Up to 6 Cu wiring levels are built at minimum metal-contacted pitch of 0.63 /spl mu/m, with W local-interconnect and contact levels and a polycontacted pitch of 0.81 /spl mu/m, on a fully-scaled sub 0.25 /spl mu/m, 1.8 V CMOS technology. The Cu wiring has advantages of significantly lower resistance, higher allowed current density, and increased scalability, relative to comparable Ti/Al(Cu) wiring. These benefits in turn have enabled the scaling of pitch and thickness, from reduced-capacitance, high-density lower levels to low RC global wiring levels, consistent with high-performance and high-density needs. The integrated Cu hardware was evaluated according to a comprehensive set of yield, reliability, and stress tests. This included fully functional, high-density 288 K SRAM chips which were packaged into product modules and successfully tested for reliability. Overall, we find the results for full Cu wiring meet or exceed the standards set by our Al(Cu)/W-stud technology.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1997.650496","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting.

The fabrication process using a Co-Salicide Direct-Strap is fully compatible with salicide-CMOS for high performance applications with no need for any local interconnects or even contact-implants. In this process, a sidewall spacer is selectively etched at the location for Direct-Strap connection before source-drain implants.

To achieve the full potential of these \"single-chip multiprocessors\", however, we must find a way to parallelize non-numeric applications. Unfortunately, compilers have had little success in parallelizing non-numeric codes due to their complex access patterns. This paper explores the potential for using thread-level data speculation (TLDS) to overcome this limitation by allowing the compiler to view parallelization solely as a cost/benefit tradeoff rather than something which is likely to violate program correctness. Our experimental results demonstrate that with realistic compiler support, TLDS can offer significant program speedups. We also demonstrate that through modest hardware extensions, a generic single-chip multiprocessor could support TLDS by augmenting its cache coherence scheme to detect dependence violations, and by using the primary data caches to buffer speculative state.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1998.650541","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Fourth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Fourth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5242/14198/00650541.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1998.650541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14198","startPage":"2","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The potential for using thread-level data speculation to facilitate automatic parallelization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The potential for using thread-level data speculation to facilitate automatic parallelization","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650541/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5849821","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The potential for using thread-level data speculation to facilitate automatic parallelization","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00650541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050307S","chronDate":"1-4 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5242","citationCount":"122","articleId":"650541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":650559,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Such ambiguous memory dependences can be overcome by memory dependence speculation which enables a load or store to be speculatively executed before the addresses of all preceding loads and stores are known. Furthermore, multiple speculative stores to a memory location create multiple speculative versions of the location. Program order among the speculative versions must be tracked to maintain sequential semantics. A previously proposed approach, the address resolution buffer (ARB) uses a centralized buffer to support speculative versions. Our proposal, called the speculative versioning cache (SVC), uses distributed caches to eliminate the latency and bandwidth problems of the ARB. The SVC conceptually unifies cache coherence and speculative versioning by using an organization similar to snooping bus-based coherent caches. A preliminary evaluation for the multiscalar architecture shows that hit latency is an important factor affecting performance, and private cache solutions trade-off hit rate for hit latency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1998.650559","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1998.650559","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Fourth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5242/14198/00650559.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Fourth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speculative versioning cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Speculative versioning cache","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Feb 1998","conferenceDate":"1-4 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5842967","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speculative versioning cache","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00650559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037907S","chronDate":"1-4 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5242","citationCount":"86","articleId":"650559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650571,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The advent of high density field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), in combination with new synthesis tools, have made it relatively easy to produce programmable custom machines without building specific hardware. In many cases, the performance achieved by a FPGA based custom computer is attributed to the exploitation of massive concurrency in the underlying application. In this paper we explore the sources of speedup for irregular problems in which is difficult to exploit such parallelism. We highlight 5 main sources of speedup that we have observed, namely the provision of high memory bandwidth, the use of flexible address generation hardware, the use of gather-scatter array operations, the use of lookup tables and the use of multiple tailored arithmetic units. By considering some representative examples of such irregular problems, the paper illustrates that good performance is possible given the current generation of FPGA devices and RISC processors. The paper then explores whether this performance gain will be possible given the next generation of RISC processors and FPGAs. It concludes that the only way to maintain the speedup is to alter the architecture of CCMs in combination with architectural changes to the FPGAs themselves.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Fourth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Fourth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5242/14198/00650571.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1998.650571","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1998.650571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based custom computing machines for irregular problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based custom computing machines for irregular problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650571/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5842976","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Feb 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based custom computing machines for irregular problems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00650571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053948S","chronDate":"1-4 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5242","citationCount":"6","articleId":"650571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":650574,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

In order to mitigate this problem we present a new non-clustered sampling technique for rapidly evaluating the performance of a large number of branch predictors in a single rapid pass through a trace. The predictors studied in this single pass need not closely resemble one another. Each may use a radically different method of indexing into one or more arrays of two bit counters. In experiments with SPEC95 benchmarks we have found that while sampling on the order of one branch per every ten thousand we can typically produce correct results for all but a few hundredths of a percent of the branches in the sample. The only instances we have found where this is not the case are degenerate cases in which we show that full-trace modeling also fails to give accurate results.

At selected sample points in the trace, this structure is queried to determine the behavior of particular operations.

In this paper, a calibration method is presented which features a progressive improvement in the sensor calibrated transfer toward the desired transfer as the user proceeds from one calibration point to the next. The method is based on a set of mathematical formulas whereby a calibration coefficient is calculated at a selected calibration point and used to calculate a first correction of the sensor transfer curve. Further improvement in the sensor transfer is obtained by repeating the process for a second calibration point using the transfer resulting from the first calibration, without the need to review the calibration already carried out at the first point. The process can be repeated until the desired error reduction is obtained. Step by step, the calibration method builds up a polynomial transfer correction. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the performance of the method, A software implementation of the method for two-dimensional (2-D) calibration in an 8-bit microcontroller is presented. The microcontroller with calibration program can be incorporated in a compact smart sensor system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5756179","volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A noniterative polynomial 2-D calibration method implemented in a microcontroller","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A noniterative polynomial 2-D calibration method implemented in a microcontroller","sourcePdf":"00650767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043434S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"14201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"30","articleId":"650767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":650768,"authors":[{"name":"P.C. de Jong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Electronics Research Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"P.C.","lastName":"de Jong","id":"37328499300"},{"name":"G.C.M.

A new algorithm adopted from the echo-avoidance model of the precedence effect was used to detect the echo-free onsets by specifying a generalized pattern of impulse response. Fine structure time differences were calculated from the zero-crossing points in different microphones. They were integrated into an azimuth histogram by the restrictions between them. Two sound sources were localized in both an anechoic chamber and a normal room which has walls, floor, and ceiling made of concrete. The time segment needed for localization was 0.5-2 s and the accuracy was a few degrees in both environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel3/19/14201/00650785.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/19.650785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.650785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sound localization in reverberant environment based on the model of the precedence effect","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Psychoacoustic models","Humans","Loudspeakers","Speech","Time factors","Microphones","Azimuth","Histograms","Anechoic chambers","Floors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic generators","transient response","anechoic chambers","acoustic signal detection","speech processing","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverberant environment","precedence effect","sound localization","continuous speech sources","concurrent and continuous speech sources","echo-avoidance model","echo-free onsets","impulse response","fine structure time differences","zero-crossing points","microphones","azimuth histogram","sound sources","anechoic chamber","time segment","0.5 to 2 s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Sound localization in reverberant environment based on the model of the precedence effect","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5756196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sound localization in reverberant environment based on the model of the precedence effect","sourcePdf":"00650785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025476S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"14201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"67","articleId":"650785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":650787,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A vector hydrophone comprises two or three spatially co-located, orthogonally oriented identical velocity hydrophones (each of which measures one Cartesian component of the underwater acoustical particle velocity vector-field) plus an optional pressure hydrophone. Each incident source's directions-of-arrival are determined from the source's acoustical particle velocity components, which are extracted by decoupling the data covariance matrix's signal-subspace eigenvectors using the lower dimensional eigenvectors obtainable by ESPRIT. These direction-cosine estimates are unambiguous but have high variance; they are used as coarse references to disambiguate the cyclic phase ambiguities in ESPRIT's eigenvalues when the intervector-hydrophone spacing exceeds a half-wavelength. In one simulation scenario, the estimation standard deviation decreases with increasing intervector-hydrophone spacing up to 12 wavelengths, effecting a 97% reduction in the estimation standard deviation relative to the half-wavelength case. This proposed scheme and the attendant vector-hydrophone array outperform a uniform half-wavelength spaced pressure-hydrophone array with the same aperture and slightly greater number of component hydrophones by an order of magnitude in estimation standard deviation. Other simulations demonstrate how this proposed method improves underwater acoustic communications link performance. The virtual array interpolation technique would allow this proposed algorithm to be used with irregular array geometries.","doi":"10.1109/48.650832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/48/14203/00650832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.650832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14203","startPage":"659","endPage":"672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended-aperture underwater acoustic multisource azimuth/elevation direction-finding using uniformly but sparsely spaced vector hydrophones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extended-aperture underwater acoustic multisource azimuth/elevation direction-finding using uniformly but sparsely spaced vector hydrophones","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5763683","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended-aperture underwater acoustic multisource azimuth/elevation direction-finding using uniformly but sparsely spaced vector hydrophones","sourcePdf":"00650832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068867S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"14203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"106","articleId":"650832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":650847,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

We approximate the boundary by a polygon, and consider the problem of finding the polygon which leads to the smallest distortion for a given number of bits. We also address the dual problem of finding the polygon which leads to the smallest bit rate for a given distortion. We consider two different classes of distortion measures. The first class is based on the maximum operator and the second class is based on the summation operator. For the first class, we derive a fast and optimal scheme that is based on a shortest path algorithm for a weighted directed acyclic graph. For the second class we propose a solution approach that is based on the Lagrange multiplier method, which uses the above-mentioned shortest path algorithm. Since the Lagrange multiplier method can only find solutions on the convex hull of the operational rate distortion function, we also propose a tree-pruning-based algorithm that can find all the optimal solutions. Finally, we present results of the proposed schemes using objects from the Miss America sequence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5814350","pubMedId":"18267376","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An optimal polygonal boundary encoding scheme in the rate distortion sense","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal polygonal boundary encoding scheme in the rate distortion sense","sourcePdf":"00650847.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028963S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"78","articleId":"650847","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":650848,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It uses an explicit spline representation of the images in conjunction with spline processing, and is based on a coarse-to-fine iterative strategy (pyramid approach). The minimization is performed according to a new variation (ML*) of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear least-square optimization. The geometric deformation model is a global three-dimensional (3-D) affine transformation that can be optionally restricted to rigid-body motion (rotation and translation), combined with isometric scaling. It also includes an optional adjustment of image contrast differences. We obtain excellent results for the registration of intramodality positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We conclude that the multiresolution refinement strategy is more robust than a comparable single-stage method, being less likely to be trapped into a false local optimum.

Thanks to a geometrical transform supported by a specific hardware module, the perspective effect is removed from both left and right stereo images; the left is used to detect lane markings with a series of morphological filters, while both remapped stereo images are used for the detection of free-space in front of the vehicle. The output of the processing is displayed on both an on-board monitor and a control-panel to give visual feedbacks to the driver. The system was tested on the mobile laboratory (MOB-LAB) experimental land vehicle, which was driven for more than 3000 km along extra-urban roads and freeways at speeds up to 80 km/h, and demonstrated its robustness with respect to shadows and changing illumination conditions, different road textures, and vehicle movement.","doi":"10.1109/83.650851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/14206/00650851.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.650851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GOLD: a parallel real-time stereo vision system for generic obstacle and lane detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"GOLD: a parallel real-time stereo vision system for generic obstacle and lane detection","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5814354","pubMedId":"18267380","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GOLD: a parallel real-time stereo vision system for generic obstacle and lane detection","sourcePdf":"00650851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052529S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"702","articleId":"650851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":650856,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By means of Markov random fields (MRF's) the segmentation algorithm captures three features that are of special importance for MR images, i.e., nonparametric distributions of tissue intensities, neighborhood correlations, and signal inhomogeneities. Detailed simulations and real MR images demonstrate the performance of the segmentation algorithm. In particular, the impact of noise, inhomogeneity, smoothing, and structure thickness are analyzed quantitatively. Even single-echo MR images are well classified into gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, scalp-bone, and background.

This hybrid neural network method uses a Kohonen self-organizing neural network for segmentation and a multilayer backpropagation neural network for classification. To separate different tissue types, this process uses the standard T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted MR images acquired in clinical examinations. Volumetric measurements of brain structures, relative to intracranial volume, were calculated for an index transverse section in 14 normal subjects (median age 25 years; 7 male, 7 female). This index slice was at the level of the basal ganglia, included both genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, and generally, showed the putamen and lateral ventricle. An intraclass correlation of this automated segmentation and classification of tissues with the accepted standard of radiologist identification for the index slice in the 14 volunteers demonstrated coefficients (r/sub i/) of 0.91, 0.95, and 0.98 for white matter, gray matter, and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively. An analysis of variance for estimates of brain parenchyma volumes in 5 volunteers imaged 5 times each demonstrated high intrasubject reproducibility with a significance of at least p<0.05 for white matter, gray matter, and white/gray partial volumes. The population variation, across 14 volunteers, demonstrated little deviation from the averages for gray and white matter, while partial volume classes exhibited a slightly higher degree of variability. This fully automated technique produces reliable and reproducible MR image segmentation and classification while eliminating intra- and interobserver variability.","doi":"10.1109/42.650887","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/14208/00650887.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"918","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.650887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated segmentation and classification of multispectral magnetic resonance images of brain using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Automated segmentation and classification of multispectral magnetic resonance images of brain using artificial neural networks","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5878738","pubMedId":"9533591","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated segmentation and classification of multispectral magnetic resonance images of brain using artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00650887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11822S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"211","articleId":"650887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":650903,"authors":[{"name":"V.L.

The video codec first performs a motion-compensated three-dimensional (3-D) wavelet (packet) decomposition of a group of video frames, and then encodes the important wavelet coefficients using a new data structure called tri-zerotrees (TRI-ZTR). Together, the proposed video coding framework forms an extension of the original zero tree idea of Shapiro (1992) for still image compression. In addition, we also incorporate a high degree of video scalability into the codec by combining the layered/progressive coding strategy with the concept of embedded resolution block coding. With scalable algorithms, only one original compressed video bit stream is generated. Different subsets of the bit stream can then be selected at the decoder to support a multitude of display specifications such as bit rate, quality level, spatial resolution, frame rate, decoding hardware complexity, and end-to-end coding delay. The proposed video codec also allows precise bit rate control at both the encoder and decoder, and this can be achieved independently of the other video scaling parameters. Such a scheme is very useful for both constant and variable bit rate transmission over mobile communication channels, as well as video distribution over heterogeneous multicast networks. Finally, our simulations demonstrated comparable objective and subjective performance when compared to the ITU-T H.263 video coding standard, while providing both multirate and multiresolution video scalability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/14191/00650917.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.650917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.650917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly scalable wavelet-based video codec for very low bit-rate environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video codecs","Video compression","Image coding","Spatial resolution","Decoding","Bit rate","Video coding","Scalability","Streaming media","Teleconferencing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","transform coding","video coding","data compression","teleconferencing","telephony","image resolution","tree data structures","motion compensation","decoding","telecommunication networks","video codecs","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable video compression system","scalable wavelet-based video codec","very low bit-rate","telephony","videoconferencing","motion-compensated 3D wavelet packet decomposition","video frames","wavelet coefficients encoding","layered/progressive coding","tri-zerotrees data structure","embedded resolution block coding","scalable algorithms","compressed video bit stream","heterogeneous multicast networks","display specifications","quality level","spatial resolution","frame rate","decoding hardware complexity","bit rate control","discrete wavelet transform","end-to-end coding delay","objective performance","mobile communication channels","subjective performance","10 to 30 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Highly scalable wavelet-based video codec for very low bit-rate environment","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5803785","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly scalable wavelet-based video codec for very low bit-rate environment","sourcePdf":"00650917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04236S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"52","articleId":"650917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":650927,"authors":[{"name":"H.I.

The recently completed collaborative European project DELPHI has been concerned with the creation and experimental validation of thermal models (both detailed and compact) of a range of electronic parts, including mono-chip packages, heat sinks, electrolytic capacitors, transformers, and interfacing materials. The ultimate goal of the DELPHI project was to get component manufacturers to supply validated thermal models of their parts to end users by adopting the experimental techniques used to validate the detailed thermal conduction models of the parts, and the methods to generate compact models. Part II of this paper contains technical information on both experimental and numerical methods. In order to reduce design-cycle time and physical prototyping, equipment manufacturers need to ascertain the thermal performance of new systems at the earliest possible stage of the design process. Accurate, validated thermal models of the critical parts used in the design are needed to provide the thermal precision necessary to design out the functional and reliability failures that result from component overheating.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5802916","volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The world of thermal characterization according to DELPHI-Part I: Background to DELPHI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The world of thermal characterization according to DELPHI-Part I: Background to DELPHI","sourcePdf":"00650927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040513S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"60","articleId":"650927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":650940,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Sandwich double-cantilever beam (DCB) specimens were fabricated using nickel and copper-coated copper substrates bonded with a thin layer of silica-filled polymer encapsulant. Under cyclic loading, crack propagation was found to occur at the polymer-metal interface. The interfacial failure mode was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the fatigue fracture surfaces. The crack growth rate was found to have a power-law dependence on the strain energy release rate range, and exhibited a crack growth threshold, much like the fatigue crack growth threshold stress intensity factor range for monolithic bulk metals, polymers, and ceramics. Interfacial FCP data for three candidate encapsulants predicted cracking resistances that were well correlated with package-level reliability tests. By varying the surface roughness of the copper and nickel plating, it was shown that interfacial FCP resistance increased with increasing roughness. The observed increases in FCP resistance were attributed to a reduction in the effective driving force for fatigue fracture along the rougher interfaces, and could be accounted for by a crack-deflection model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650940/","volume":"20","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5810048","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fatigue crack propagation along polymer-metal interfaces in microelectronic packages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fatigue crack propagation along polymer-metal interfaces in microelectronic packages","sourcePdf":"00650940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051166S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"28","articleId":"650940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":650941,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Institute for Manufacturing Research, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Sheng Liu","id":"38556212700"},{"name":"Jiansen Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Institute for Manufacturing Research, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Jiansen Zhu","id":"37350681300"},{"name":"Daqing Zou","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Institute for Manufacturing Research, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Daqing Zou","id":"37341595500"},{"name":"J.

These effects are investigated in two settings: frame expansions (representations obtained by forming inner products with each element of the set) and matching pursuit expansions (approximations obtained by greedily forming linear combinations). In both cases, based on the concept of consistency, it is shown that traditional linear reconstruction methods are suboptimal, and better consistent reconstruction algorithms are given. The proposed consistent reconstruction algorithms were in each case implemented, and experimental results are included. For frame expansions, results are proven to bound distortion as a function of frame redundancy r and quantization step size for linear, consistent, and optimal reconstruction methods. Taken together, these suggest that optimal reconstruction methods will yield O(1/r/sup 2/) mean-squared error (MSE), and that consistency is sufficient to insure this asymptotic behavior. A result on the asymptotic tightness of random frames is also proven. Applicability of quantized matching pursuit to lossy vector compression is explored. Experiments demonstrate the likelihood that a linear reconstruction is inconsistent, the MSE reduction obtained with a nonlinear (consistent) reconstruction algorithm, and generally competitive performance at low bit rates.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Reconstruction algorithms","Vectors","Quantization","Signal processing algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Acoustic distortion","Nonlinear distortion","Redundancy","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector quantisation","source coding","signal reconstruction","random processes","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantized overcomplete expansions","IR/sup N/","analysis","synthesis","algorithms","vector representations","frame expansions","inner products","matching pursuit expansions","linear combinations","suboptimal linear reconstruction methods","distortion","frame redundancy","quantization step size","O(1/r/sup 2/) mean-squared error","asymptotic behavior","asymptotic tightness","random frames","lossy vector compression","MSE reduction","source coding","signal processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=650985","doi":"10.1109/18.650985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/14195/00650985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.650985","startPage":"16","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized overcomplete expansions in IR/sup N/: analysis, synthesis, and algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantized overcomplete expansions in IR/sup N/: analysis, synthesis, and algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/650985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5812002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized overcomplete expansions in IR/sup N/: analysis, synthesis, and algorithms","sourcePdf":"00650985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037481S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"277","articleId":"650985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":650987,"authors":[{"name":"En-hui Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"En-hui Yang","id":"37272530400"},{"name":"J.C.

In the lossless case, a result of Wyner and Ziv (1989) is extended. In the lossy case, a data compression algorithm based on approximate string matching is analyzed in the following two frameworks: (1) the database and the source together form a Markov chain of finite order; (2) the database and the source are independent with the database coming from a Markov model and the source from a general stationary, ergodic model. In either framework, it is shown that the resulting compression rate converges with probability one to a quantity computable as the infimum of an information theoretic functional over a set of auxiliary random variables; the quantity is strictly greater than the rate distortion function of the source except in some symmetric cases.

Various structured index assignments are compared. Our analytic formulas provide a computationally efficient method for determining the performance of various coding schemes.

The bounds are in terms of the dimension n and the coding gain /spl gamma/ of L, and are obtained based on a decoding algorithm which is an improved version of Kannan's (1983) method. The latter is currently the fastest known method for the decoding of a general lattice. For the decoding of a point x, the proposed algorithm recursively searches inside an, n-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped (cube), centered at x, with its edges along the Gram-Schmidt vectors of a proper basis of L. We call algorithms of this type recursive cube search (RCS) algorithms. It is shown that Kannan's algorithm also belongs to this category. The complexity of RCS algorithms is measured in terms of the number of lattice points that need to be examined before a decision is made. To tighten the upper bound on the complexity, we select a lattice basis which is reduced in the sense of Korkin-Zolotarev (1873). It is shown that for any selected basis, the decoding complexity (using RCS algorithms) of any sequence of lattices with possible application in communications (/spl gamma//spl ges/1) grows at least exponentially with n and /spl gamma/. It is observed that the densest lattices, and almost all of the lattices used in communications, e.g., Barnes-Wall lattices and the Leech lattice, have equal successive minima (ESM). For the decoding complexity of ESM lattices, a tighter upper bound and a stronger lower bound result are derived.","doi":"10.1109/18.651011","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/14195/00651011.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.651011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"162","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the complexity of decoding lattices using the Korkin-Zolotarev reduced basis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=651011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of decoding lattices using the Korkin-Zolotarev reduced basis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651011/","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5812011","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of decoding lattices using the Korkin-Zolotarev reduced basis","sourcePdf":"00651011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055434S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"32","articleId":"651011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":651015,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The techniques described in this paper allow the separate evaluation of codes and decoders and thus the identification of where loss of capacity occurs. They are, moreover, very useful for the overall design of a communications system, e.g., for evaluating the benefits of inner decoders that produce side information. The first two sections of this paper provide a general technique (based on the coset weight distribution of a binary linear code) for calculating the composite capacity of the code and a BSC in isolation. The later sections examine the composite capacities of binary linear codes, the BSC, and various decoders. The composite capacities of the (8,4) extended Hamming, (24, 12) extended Golay, and (48, 24) quadratic residue codes appear as examples throughout the paper. The calculations in these examples show that, in a concatenated coding system, having an inner decoder provide more information than the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate to an outer decoder is not a computationally efficient technique, unless generalized minimum-distance decoding of an outer code is extremely easy. Specifically, for the (8,4) extended Hamming and (24, 12) extended Golay inner codes, the gains from using any inner decoder providing side information, instead of a strictly ML inner decoder, are shown to be no greater than 0.77 and 0.34 dB, respectively, for a BSC crossover probability of 0.1 or less, However, if computationally efficient generalized minimum distance decoders for powerful outer codes, e.g., Reed-Solomon codes, become available, they will allow the use of simple inner codes, since both simple and complex inner codes have very similar capacity losses.","doi":"10.1109/18.651018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/14195/00651018.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.651018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity of binary channels that use linear codes and decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=651018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of binary channels that use linear codes and decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651018/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5812014","volume":"44","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of binary channels that use linear codes and decoders","sourcePdf":"00651018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060218S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","articleId":"651018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":651022,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The 2-D linear complexity theorem is further utilized to present a new approach for decoding of cyclic codes, in general, and 2-D BCH codes in particular. An alternative exposition of Blahut's decoding algorithms, in the DFT domain, for random and burst error correction in 2-D BCH codes is given from a deconvolution viewpoint. Some modifications for efficient implementation of Blahut's decoding algorithms for random and burst error correction are suggested and improved decoding algorithms are presented. It is shown that the improved decoding algorithm requires at most half the number of passes through the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm compared to the Blahut's decoding algorithm. It is shown that Blahut's decoding algorithms have optimal error-correcting capability and improved decoding algorithms have less computational complexity. A comparative study of various time- and spectral-domain implementations of 2-D BCH decoding algorithms is also given.","doi":"10.1109/18.651066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/14195/00651066.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.651066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Blahut's decoding algorithms for two-dimensional BCH codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=651066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"On Blahut's decoding algorithms for two-dimensional BCH codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651066/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5812036","volume":"44","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Blahut's decoding algorithms for two-dimensional BCH codes","sourcePdf":"00651066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021717S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","articleId":"651066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":651067,"authors":[{"name":"A.

First, it is shown that the least reliable basis (LRB) and the most reliable basis (MRB) are dual of each other. By exploiting this duality, an algorithm performing maximum-likelihood (ML) soft-decision syndrome decoding based on the LRB is presented. Contrarily to previous LRB-based ML syndrome decoding algorithms, this algorithm is more conveniently implementable for codes whose codimension is not small. New sufficient conditions for optimality are derived. These conditions exploit both the ordering associated with the LRB and the structure of the code considered. With respect to MRR-based sufficient conditions, they present the advantage of requiring no soft information and thus can be preprocessed and stored. Based on these conditions, low-complexity soft-decision syndrome decoding algorithms for particular classes of codes are proposed. Finally, a simple algorithm is analyzed. After the construction of the LRB, this algorithm computes the syndrome of smallest Hamming weight among o(K/sup i/) candidates, where K is the dimension of the code, for an order i of reprocessing. At practical bit-error rates, for codes of length N/spl les/128, this algorithm always outperforms any algebraic decoding algorithm capable of correcting up to t+1 errors with an order of reprocessing of at most 2, where t is the error-correcting capability of the code considered.","doi":"10.1109/18.651070","startPage":"388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/14195/00651070.pdf","endPage":"398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.651070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651070/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-based syndrome decoding of linear block codes","volume":"44","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5812040","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-based syndrome decoding of linear block codes","sourcePdf":"00651070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061656S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"21","articleId":"651070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":651071,"authors":[{"name":"L.E.

This approach minimizes a cost function derived from Bayes' theorem. The method is suitable for line spectra since a \"long tailed\" distribution is used to model the prior distribution of spectral amplitudes. Since the data themselves are used as constraints, phase information can also be recovered and used to extend the data outside the original window. The objective function is formulated in terms of hyperparameters that control the degree of fit and spectral resolution. Noise rejection can also be achieved by truncating the number of iterations. Spectral resolution and extrapolation length are controlled by a single parameter. When this parameter is large compared with the spectral powers, the algorithm leads to zero extrapolation of the data, and the estimated Fourier transform yields the periodogram. When the data are sampled at a constant rate, the algorithm uses one Levinson recursion per iteration. For irregular sampling, the algorithm uses one Cholesky decomposition per iteration. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated with three different problems that arise in geophysical data: (1) harmonic retrieval from a time series contaminated with noise; (2) linear event detection from a finite aperture array of receivers, (3) interpolation/extrapolation of gapped data. The performance of the algorithm as a spectral estimator is tested with the Kay and Marple (1981) data set.","doi":"10.1109/78.651165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14197/00651165.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.651165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"31","endPage":"38","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation and extrapolation using a high-resolution discrete Fourier transform","volume":"46","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5806661","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation and extrapolation using a high-resolution discrete Fourier transform","sourcePdf":"00651165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027749S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"206","articleId":"651165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":651167,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A novel mixed adaptive direct/feedback network that is free of implementation constraints is investigated from the points of view of stability and convergence and compared with the direct and feedback networks.

The primary requirement for these filters is that they must possess a notch in tune with the jammer instantaneous frequency (IF) to annihilate the interference power at every time sample. The interference time-varying frequency can be obtained using existing IF estimators, including quadratic time-frequency distribution methods. Without focusing on any specific estimator, we develop expressions for the receiver performance using a general class of multiple-zero FIR excision filters and show the dependence of the bit error rate (BER) on the filter order and its group delay. The effect of inaccuracies in the jammer instantaneous frequency information on the receiver performance is considered and evaluated as a function of the filter notch bandwidth. The latter is defined by the filter zero multiplicity, which is shown to be an important factor in the analysis of the correlator signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","doi":"10.1109/78.651179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14197/00651179.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.651179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of instantaneous frequency-based interference excision techniques in spread spectrum communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=651179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651179/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of instantaneous frequency-based interference excision techniques in spread spectrum communications","volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5806665","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of instantaneous frequency-based interference excision techniques in spread spectrum communications","sourcePdf":"00651179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051005S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","articleId":"651179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":651181,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The first algorithm is an interpolator that uses the peak sample in the discrete Fourier spectrum (DFS) of the data and its two neighbors. We derive Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for such interpolators and show that they are very close to the CRB's for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. The new algorithm almost reaches these bounds. A second algorithm uses the five DFS samples centered on the peak to produce estimates even closer to ML. Enhancements are presented that maintain nearly ML performance for small values of N. For multiple complex tones with frequency separations of at least 4/spl pi//N rad/sample, unbiased estimates are obtained by incorporating the new single-tone estimators into an iterative \"cyclic descent\" algorithm, which is a computationally cheap nonlinear optimization. Single or multiple real tones are handled in the same way. The new algorithms are immune to nonzero mean signals and (provided N is large) remain near-optimal in colored and non-Gaussian noise.","doi":"10.1109/78.651200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14197/00651200.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.651200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast nearly ML estimation of the parameters of real or complex single tones or resolved multiple tones","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Fast nearly ML estimation of the parameters of real or complex single tones or resolved multiple tones","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5806670","volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast nearly ML estimation of the parameters of real or complex single tones or resolved multiple tones","sourcePdf":"00651200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041578S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"184","articleId":"651200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":651203,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37279843500"},{"name":"P.

Two cases are discussed: wavelets with two-fold symmetry (centrosymmetric) and wavelets with four-fold symmetry that are symmetric (or anti-symmetric) about the vertical and horizontal axes. We show that imposing the requirement of linear phase in the case of order-factorable wavelets imposes a simple constraint on each of its polynomial order-1 factors. We thus obtain a simple and complete method of constructing orthogonal order-factorable wavelets with linear phase. This method is exemplified by design in the case of four-band separable sampling.

This paper describes an alternative approach to parallel computing-reconfigurable or virtual parallel processing (VPP). Rather than mapping an application onto a given parallel machine, the VPP approach synthesizes the appropriate type and number of processing elements, as well as the interconnection topology, that is optimal for the application. For each application, configuration data is downloaded to the machine that personalizes the hardware for the task at hand. The paper provides a brief description of the authors reconfigurable computer, Archimedes. The benefits of the VPP approach are highlighted by an example application-the 2-D FFT. A novel parallel implementation of a polynomial transform based 2-D transform is described and compared to results for distributed memory parallel machines that have been reported in the literature. The comparison highlights the computational advantage provided by reconfigurable computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/5245/14210/00651485.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICAPP.1997.651485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAPP.1997.651485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=651485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual parallel processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Concurrent computing","Computer architecture","Application software","Parallel processing","Hardware","Parallel machines","Integrated circuit interconnections","Polynomials","Reconfigurable logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","virtual machines","reconfigurable architectures","parallel architectures","fast Fourier transforms","polynomials","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual parallel processors","SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays","parallel computing architectures","interconnection topology","configuration data","Archimedes","2-D FFT","polynomial transform","2-D transform","distributed memory parallel machines","reconfigurable computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Virtual parallel processors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5842308","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual parallel processors","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"00651485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032542S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5245","citationCount":"2","articleId":"651485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":651518,"authors":[{"name":"Sam Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Sam Lin","id":"37087541742"},{"name":"R.W.H.

This is quite satisfactory for stationary data statistics, but for the nonstationary case it is necessary to be able to adapt the network during operation. This paper describes adaptive learning schemes for the modified probabilistic neural network for both stationary and nonstationary data statistics. A nonlinear control problem is used to illustrate and compare the network's learning ability with that of the general regression and radial basis function neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICAPP.1997.651526","pdfPath":"/iel4/5245/14210/00651526.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"610","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAPP.1997.651526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive learning schemes for the modified probabilistic neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive learning schemes for the modified probabilistic neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5842347","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive learning schemes for the modified probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"00651526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052817S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5245","citationCount":"3","articleId":"651526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":651528,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The BESS facility has been in operation for six years and has been used for load leveling and peaking functions. The BESS power conversion system was built with the then state of the art technology and has a very fast response rate when changing power output of the batteries. SCE installed an energy source power system stabilizer (ESPSS) to test the concept of providing damping of power system swings using the ESPSS. The ESPSS basically modulates the power output/input of the energy storage batteries to respond to system frequency deviations caused by power system oscillations. The ESPSS differs from a conventional power system stabilizer. It is designed to change the power output of the power source rather than the voltage or the reactive power output. While installing the ESPSS several upgrades to the BESS were made to improve reliability. Installation of the ESPSS on the battery enables SCE to test the concept of system stabilization using power source output modulation instead of reactive power modulation. The energy storage batteries provide an easy test bed for conducting field tests and response of the ESPSS to system disturbances. This paper discusses the BESS, the ESPSS and presents recorded results from system disturbance monitoring and field tests conducted on the ESPSS and the batteries.","doi":"10.1109/59.651626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.651626","startPage":"145","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/14211/00651626.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of an energy source power system stabilizer on the 10 MW battery energy storage system at Chino substation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Application of an energy source power system stabilizer on the 10 MW battery energy storage system at Chino substation","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5826367","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651626/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an energy source power system stabilizer on the 10 MW battery energy storage system at Chino substation","sourcePdf":"00651626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05057S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"57","articleId":"651626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":651632,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.S.

By using Lagrangian multipliers to relax system-wide demand and reserve requirements, the problem is decomposed into thermal and hydro subproblems. The thermal subproblem is solved by using dynamic programming without discretizing generation levels. Instead of solving the hydro subproblems independently as done in the standard Lagrangian relaxation formulation, the hydrothermal scheduling is used to solve for the output levels of hydro units. The hydrothermal scheduling uses the commitment status of thermal units obtained from the thermal subproblem. Extensive constraints are considered such as power balance, spinning reserve, minimum up/down time, capacity limits, ramp rate and hydro constraints. Accurate transmission losses are incorporated and nonlinear cost functions are used. Numerical results based on a practical electric utility data show that this new approach consistently provides better schedules than the standard Lagrangian relaxation approach.","doi":"10.1109/59.651640","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/14211/00651640.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"235","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.651640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hydrothermal scheduling based Lagrangian relaxation approach to hydrothermal coordination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Hydrothermal scheduling based Lagrangian relaxation approach to hydrothermal coordination","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5826379","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydrothermal scheduling based Lagrangian relaxation approach to hydrothermal coordination","sourcePdf":"00651640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032063S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"104","articleId":"651640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":651644,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

If two signals at different carrier frequencies are incident at the input of an amplifier, due to the nonlinearity, these signals will interact with each other and the output will contain additional signals at all combinations of sum and difference of these frequencies, which are IM products. The injection of the second harmonics of the two input in the amplifier together with the fundamental signals will produce additional IM products at the output. By proper selection of phase and amplitude of the injected second harmonics, it is possible to make the third order IM products produced by the second harmonics and the original third order IM products out of phase and equal in amplitude. As a result third order IM products will be eliminated, in principle. Theory and simulation results obtained at 2.5 GHz are presented which supports the suggestion.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Communication systems","Power amplifiers","Mobile handsets","Microwave amplifiers","Transmitters","Power generation","Circuit simulation","Character generation","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermodulation distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second harmonic injection technique","low intermodulation RF amplifiers","low intermodulation microwave amplifiers","third order IMD reduction","IM distortion","injected second harmonics","third order IM products elimination"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HFPSC.1997.651672","publicationTitle":"MTT/ED/AP/LEO Societies Joint Chapter United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Section. 1997 High Frequency Postgraduate Student Colloquium","displayPublicationTitle":"MTT/ED/AP/LEO Societies Joint Chapter United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Section. 1997 High Frequency Postgraduate Student Colloquium","pdfPath":"/iel4/5244/14200/00651672.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HFPSC.1997.651672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second harmonic injecting technique for low intermodulation RF-microwave amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=651672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Second harmonic injecting technique for low intermodulation RF-microwave amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/651672/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855882","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19 Sep 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second harmonic injecting technique for low intermodulation RF-microwave amplifiers","confLoc":"Leeds, UK","sourcePdf":"00651672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04699S","chronDate":"19 Sep 1997","isNumber":"14200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5244","citationCount":"7","articleId":"651672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":651673,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In order to obtain the optimum VPs system, we propose the use of the genetic algorithm (GA) to solve this kind of problem. The equivalent bandwidth of each VP which guarantees both the quality of service (QoS) in the cell level and the grade of service (GoS) in the connection level is formulated to represent the effective transmission rate of the heterogeneous traffic VP. A multi-objective function which comprises of the average blocking rate (ABR) and the average packet delay (APD) is used as the VPs system assignment constraint is to be minimized in the optimization method. We describe a simple coding technique in which each chromosome is represented as the VPs system. Also, the concept of the past solution is used in order to reduce the calculation times for adaptive VPs assignment. The numerical results show that with our proposed method, the optimum VPs system which we obtain maximizes the ATM network throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.1997.652046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.1997.652046","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

It is important that the tool produces not only a solution, but that the method used in the solution both supports and exploits the use of programmable hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/652064/","accessionNumber":"5972343","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A high-level tool for the development of FPLD-based stochastic neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-level tool for the development of FPLD-based stochastic neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00652064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028808S","chronDate":"9-12 Sep 1997","isNumber":"14215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5224","citationCount":"1","articleId":"652064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":652065,"authors":[{"name":"Rey-Chue Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kaohsiung Polytechnic Institute, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rey-Chue Hwang","id":"37087330026"},{"name":"Huang-Chu Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Huang-Chu Huang","id":"37087329140"},{"name":"Yu-Ju Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lee Ming Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Ju Chen","id":"37087329445"},{"name":"Jer-Guang Hsich","lastName":"Jer-Guang Hsich","id":"37087001883"},{"name":"Hsing Chao","lastName":"Hsing Chao","id":"37087001703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3676-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"652065","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=652065","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Fuzzy neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Load forecasting","Testing","Fuzzy logic","Power system modeling","Power system planning","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","load forecasting","fuzzy neural nets","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next day peak load forecasting","one-day-ahead hourly load forecasting","adaptive power signal prediction","nonfixed artificial neural network","modified fuzzy backpropagation learning rule","Taipower"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICS.1997.652065","pdfPath":"/iel4/5224/14215/00652065.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

The decorrelator approach has been investigated as a suboptimum multiuser detector for low complexity in a receiver at the expense of the enhancement and correlation of noise. In this paper, we consider a quasi maximum likelihood (quasi-ML) detector in the reverse link system which uses antenna arrays in quasi-synchronous channels. It is shown that the performance of the system is better than that of the conventional decorrelator and that the performance gain over the conventional decorrelator system increases as the number of active users and number of antenna arrays increase.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of antenna array diversity in multiuser detection of QS-CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

The diversity receptions are combined using maximal ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGG), second-order selection combining (SC2) and a simplified version of MRC (SVM) that is simply a compromise between MRC and EGG. When the path loss exponent r=4, our results indicate that only MRC can significantly improve the system performance with a capacity gain of about 160% as compared to conventional detection with perfect power control. The other techniques investigated cannot improve the cellular CD/CDMA performance. However, when r is reduced to 2, all combining methods studied can enhance the cellular capacity dramatically.

An assumption of the Poisson shot noise model for the photo-detector is adopted. Three kinds of code sequences that are generated from QC are considered. A union upper bound on the bit error rate is derived taking into account the effect of the multiple-user interference, receiver shot noise, and an optical hard-limiter. Then the performance is compared for the average power, the length of QC sequences, and the number of simultaneous users under the throughput constraints. It is found that with longer QC sequence codes, the system has a better performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of optical direct-detection CDMA systems using synchronous quadratic congruence optical codes with hard-limiter and PPM signaling","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

As each mobile receives signals from its own base station as well as other surrounding base stations, the bit-error rate (BER) analysis often results in a complicated, multi-integral expression even though Gaussian approximation is applied. Numerical computation of this expression is limited by the issues of complexity, efficiency and accuracy. As a result, SPI is introduced to evaluate the BER performance efficiently and accurately. The computational effort of this method grows only linearly with the number of interfering cells in the system regardless of the number of active mobiles in the cell. The simplified BER expressions are derived and yield accurate results.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.1997.652203","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

The proper selection of the current gain in the inner loop for current programmed regulators is discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.652318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.652318","startPage":"3110","endPage":"3111 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14217/00652318.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping in current programmed regulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Damping in current programmed regulators","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5870571","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/652318/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping in current programmed regulators","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00652318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032821S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","articleId":"652318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":652404,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Tsung Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Research and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"lastName":"Shih-Tsung Yang","id":"37087179676"},{"name":"A.

Our main contributions include Bode and Poisson type integral inequalities for the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions, together with bounds on the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity magnitudes, which are obtained for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. Part I presents Bode type integral inequalities. These inequalities may be viewed as some variants to the previously available results, but are also significantly different. The main difference is two fold. First, while the previous integral equalities are valid only under a restrictive assumption, the results herein hold in general. Secondly, in spite of the fact that the present results are based upon techniques and assumptions similar to those used in deriving Bode type integral inequalities, the in-depth study carried out here leads to more explicable expressions particularly indicative of the adverse effects of open loop unstable poles. As a direct outcome, the new results confirm that in a multivariable system design limitation and tradeoff depends on both the locations and directions of open loop unstable poles, and in particular, in how such directions may be aligned. The latter is characterized by angles measuring the mutual orientation between the pole directions.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.652416","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14217/00652416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.652416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14217","startPage":"3620","endPage":"3625 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On logarithmic integrals and performance bounds for MIMO systems.

As an application, we focus on the problem of nonlinearly parametrized systems.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.652497","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14217/00652497.pdf","startPage":"4032","endPage":"4037 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.652497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual mode adaptive control with Gaussian networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/652497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Dual mode adaptive control with Gaussian networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5870750","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual mode adaptive control with Gaussian networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00652497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028682S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","citationCount":"6","articleId":"652497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":652499,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A definition describing the quasi-sliding mode as such a motion of the system that its state always remains in a vicinity of the sliding hyperplane is introduced.

The strategies, when compared with previously published results, guarantee better robustness, faster error convergence and improved steady state accuracy of the system.

While many deadlock-free routing schemes have been proposed for regular networks such as mesh, torus, and hypercube, they cannot be applied in irregular networks. This paper presents a cost-effective routing architecture, called TRAIN, to solve the routing problem with irregular networks. We show that TRAIN is a deadlock-free scheme. Furthermore, unlike many other routing schemes proposed previously for irregular networks, TRAIN does not require a routing table in the switch. Due to this feature, a TRAIN switch is small and the routing decision can be made rapidly. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our routing scheme, analysis and event-driven simulation have been performed for various irregular networks. Our results show that TRAIN outperforms other schemes with a higher maximum throughput and lower average latency consistently.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/5247/14219/00652534.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.1997.652534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.1997.652534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=652534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deadlock-free routing scheme for interconnection networks with irregular topologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Routing","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Switches","Network topology","Workstations","Scalability","Hypercubes","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","network routing","multiprocessor interconnection networks","parallel architectures","virtual machines","performance evaluation","local area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadlock-free routing scheme","interconnection networks","irregular topology networks","irregular networks","communication subsystems","workstation clusters","incremental scalability","mesh","torus","hypercube","cost-effective routing architecture","TRAIN","routing table","event-driven simulation","performance","maximum throughput","average latency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/652534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A deadlock-free routing scheme for interconnection networks with irregular topologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5787618","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deadlock-free routing scheme for interconnection networks with irregular topologies","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00652534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046265S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247","citationCount":"12","articleId":"652534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":652646,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Training procedures involving augmented sets of training patterns is produced by two methods: by adding to the original set the four shifted positions about the center, and second, by magnifying +10% and -10% every handwritten digit of the original training set.

The best recognition rate of 94.2% is obtained in a genetically selected neural network of two unequal hidden layers, and trained with augmented patterns by shifting and magnification.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1996.652742","pdfPath":"/iel4/5216/14220/00652742.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1135 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 18th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 18th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1996.652742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic selection of multilayer neural networks for handwritten digit recognition to aid the blind","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/652742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-3 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Genetic selection of multilayer neural networks for handwritten digit recognition to aid the blind","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5952939","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic selection of multilayer neural networks for handwritten digit recognition to aid the blind","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00652742.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100988S","chronDate":"31 Oct-3 Nov 1996","isNumber":"14220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5216","citationCount":"1","articleId":"652742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":652744,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

In this study the authors propose to discover optimal feature extractors for MRI to increase segmentation accuracy. Genetic algorithms are applied using a fitness function based on known class labels, and on a fitness function that can be applied to data without ground truth. Both fitness functions allow the discovery of good features, that can be applied outside the data that was used for the search. An increase in the tumor true positive rate for an MRI volume using fuzzy c-means (FCM) was found from 78.7% to 91.3% of all tumor pixels with constant false negative rate.

Twenty textural features were calculated from the CT density matrix of 20 hemangiomas and 36 liver metastases and were used to train a multilayer perceptron neural network classifier and four statistical classifiers. The neural network exhibited the highest classification accuracy (83.9%) employing 3 textural features (kurtosis, angular second moment, and inverse difference moment), 2 hidden layers and 4 hidden layer nodes.

Improvements in conventional memory technologies-magnetic hard disk drives, optical disks, and semiconductor memories-have managed to keep pace with the demand for bigger, faster memories. However, there is strong evidence that these two-dimensional surface storage technologies are approaching fundamental limits. An alternative approach for next-generation memories is to store data in three dimensions. This article describes developments in holographic 3D memories, in which high density is achieved by superimposing many holograms within the same volume of recording material. Holographic storage is a promising candidate for next-generation storage. Research has demonstrated that holographic storage systems with desirable properties can be engineered. The next step is to build these systems at costs competitive with those of existing technologies and to optimize the storage media.","doi":"10.1109/2.652917","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel3/2/14232/00652917.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.652917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Holographic data storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/652917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Holographic data storage","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5844111","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Holographic data storage","sourcePdf":"00652917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041816S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"83","articleId":"652917","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":652968,"authors":[{"name":"K.

An immune feedback mechanism simultaneously responds to foreign materials and stabilizes itself. We examine an engineering application of a biological immune system and propose an immune feedback controller. We propose an immune feedback law based on the functioning of biological T-cells; it includes both at active term, which controls response speed and an inhibitive term, which controls stabilization effect. We also describe a self-tuning immune feedback controller based on the immune feedback law whose parameters are automatically tuned by using neural networks.

For these improvements to benefit overall system performance, the communication bandwidth between systems and ICs must scale accordingly. Currently, communication links in various applications approach Gbps data rates. These applications include computer-to-peripheral connections, local area networks, memory buses, and multiprocessor interconnection networks. Designers are concerned that these links will soon reach the fundamental limits of electrical signaling. In this article, we examine the limitations of CMOS implementations of highspeed links and show that the links' performance should continue to scale with technology. To handle the interconnects' finite bandwidth, however requires more sophisticated signaling methods. CMOS circuits, typically slower than circuits implemented in nonmainstream technologies, are particularly attractive for common applications because of their lower cost. The overall system cost is further reduced when signaling components are implemented as macro cells, integrated on the same die with a microprocessor or signal processing block.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel3/40/14233/00653013.pdf","doi":"10.1109/40.653013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/40.653013","startPage":"12","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed electrical signaling: overview and limitations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653013/","displayDocTitle":"High-speed electrical signaling: overview and limitations","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5843800","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed electrical signaling: overview and limitations","sourcePdf":"00653013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059186S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","isNumber":"14233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"127","articleId":"653013","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":653032,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The first half of this paper describes our study on the evaluation of the human pain tolerance limit which determines an individual's safeguarding space. We also show the human-safety-oriented design of a robot. The robot is covered with a viscoelastic material to achieve both impact force attenuation and contact sensitivity, keeping within the human pain tolerance limit. The robot, with simple direct-drive (DD) motor torque detection and emergency stop capabilities, automatically stops whenever any severe H-R contact occurs. In the second half of the paper, we propose a more efficient H-R system, which allows H-R contact for improving work efficiency, as long as the contact does not exceed the human pain tolerance limit. For this purpose, a robot is controlled to reduce its velocity with high reliability at an incipient stage of its contact with a human. Through experiments, we demonstrate the validity and efficient utility of the safeguarding space. The first experiment verifies that the developed robot exerts a contact force less than the human pain tolerance limit establishing the safeguarding space. The second experiment comparatively shows the robot's velocity reduction to accept a safe contact with the human in the space.","doi":"10.1109/3516.653047","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/3516/14234/00653047.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.653047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-robot contact in the safeguarding space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Human-robot contact in the safeguarding space","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5789326","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-robot contact in the safeguarding space","sourcePdf":"00653047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029742S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"173","articleId":"653047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":653052,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It has been applied to various kinds of miniature robots. To achieve the required motion, conventional FMAs are made of a fiber-reinforced rubber, which makes the fabrication process complicated. The fabrication of FMAs from homogeneous rubber without fiber reinforcement is necessary if low-cost manufacture is to become a reality. In this paper, a new nonreinforced FMA design is developed using a nonlinear hyperelastic finite-element-method (FEM)-based sensitivity analysis. First, global analyses of FR/LA deformation are made for a wide range of design variables. This is important, to avoid falling into a local optimization. Next, precise optimization is carried out using a sensitivity analysis. Finally, a prototype of the fiberless FMA is fabricated and tested. This process demonstrates the feasibility of the new FMA design without fiber reinforcement, both theoretically and experimentally. This new design is suitable for mass fabrication of FMAs at low cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiberless flexible microactuator designed by finite-element method","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/3516.653052","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/3516/14234/00653052.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.653052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14234","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=653052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fiberless flexible microactuator designed by finite-element method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5789331","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiberless flexible microactuator designed by finite-element method","sourcePdf":"00653052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055818S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"44","articleId":"653052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":653055,"authors":[{"name":"Z.J.

ICE employs a novel detection scheme: recursive least-squares maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (RLS-MLSE), which simultaneously estimates time-varying channel parameters and transmitted signal sequences. Diversity reception is used to enhance the signal detection performance of ICE. A computer simulation of a 40-kb/s QPSK time-division multiple-access (TDMA) cellular mobile radio system demonstrates the possibility of improving system capacity with ICE.

For the maximum Doppler frequency of 40 Hz, ICE can attain an average bit-error rate (BER) of 10/sup -2/ under a single CCI carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) of /spl sim/14 dB.

The major benefit from using coded modulation in fading channels is achieved if each code symbol of a codeword (or coded sequence) suffers statistically different fading (preferably independent fading). However, in many applications of mobile communications (e.g., in a metropolitan environment), a low vehicle speed (and hence, a small Doppler spread, f/sub D/) is very common. With a small Doppler spread, ideal or close-to-ideal interleaving is no longer feasible and all code symbols of a codeword would suffer highly correlated fading especially in stationary fading (f/sub D//spl ap/0). Coded modulations will thus suffer seriously degraded performance. Previous performance analyses based on ideal interleaving are not accurate when a small Doppler spread is encountered and the much used union bound error probability analysis is loose for small Doppler spreads. To rectify this situation, this paper presents an improved performance analysis of coded modulations with correlated fading and pilot-symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM). Transmitter diversity can generate the necessary time-varying fading to maintain the effectiveness of a coded signaling scheme which this paper examines in detail using an intentional frequency offset between antennas. This work found that proper selections of the intentional frequency offset and interleaving depth can lead to good performance with traditional coded modulations (if enough antennas are used) using essentially the same simple demodulation structure as used in the traditional single-antenna PSAM.","doi":"10.1109/25.653061","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"871","endPage":"881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/25/14240/00653061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.653061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of transmitter diversity using intentional frequency offset for wireless communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Fading","Modulation coding","Interleaved codes","Performance analysis","Mobile communication","Vehicles","Degradation","Error probability","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","land mobile radio","radio transmitters","modulation coding","fading","time-varying channels","correlation methods","Doppler effect","interleaved codes","coding errors","error statistics","decoding","demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","intentional frequency offset","wireless communications","coded modulation","interleaving","fading channel communications","error performance","fading channels","codeword","coded sequence","independent fading","metropolitan environment","low vehicle speed","small Doppler spread","code symbols","correlated fading","stationary fading","interleaving depth","union bound error probability","performance analysis","pilot symbol assisted modulation","demodulation structure","time-varying fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of transmitter diversity using intentional frequency offset for wireless communications","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5763620","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653061/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of transmitter diversity using intentional frequency offset for wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00653061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050365S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"50","articleId":"653061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":653065,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Since the usable range of the frequency spectrum is limited, the optimal channel-assignment problem has become increasingly important. A new channel-assignment algorithm using a modified Hopfield (1985, 1986) neural network is proposed. The channel-assignment problem is formulated as an energy-minimization problem that is implemented by a modified discrete Hopfield network. Also, a new technique to escape the local minima is introduced. In this algorithm, an energy function is derived, and the appropriate interconnection weights between the neurons are specified. The interconnection weights between the neurons are designed in such a way that each neuron receives inhibitory support if the constraint conditions are violated and receives excitatory support if the constraint conditions are satisfied. To escape the local minima, if the number of assigned channels are less than the required channel numbers (RCNs), one or more channels are assigned in addition to already assigned channels such that the total number of assigned channels is the same as the required number of channels in the cell even though the energy is increased. Various initialization techniques, which use the specific characteristics of frequency-assignment problems in cellular radio networks, such as cosite constraint (CSC), adjacent channel constraint (ACC), and cochannel constraint (CCC), and updating methods are investigated. In the previously proposed neural-network approach, some frequencies are fixed to accelerate the convergence time. In our algorithms, no frequency is fixed before the frequency-assignment procedure. This new algorithm, together with the proposed initialization and updating techniques and without fixing frequencies in any cells, has better performance results than the results reported previously utilizing fixed frequencies in certain cells.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653070/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5763629","volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cellular radio channel assignment using a modified Hopfield network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular radio channel assignment using a modified Hopfield network","sourcePdf":"00653070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038811S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","articleId":"653070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":653073,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The research in this field indicates the suitability of the 60-64-GHz band. Due to the distributed nature of the intervehicle communication system, an R-ALOHA protocol is considered; multihop (MH) and single-hop (SH) strategies are compared. Network performance is assessed by considering the joint impact of random access, interference, thermal noise, propagation, and packet capture effect. Several figures of merit are analyzed and discussed: packet success probability (PSP), system stabilization time (SST), first success time (FST), and deadline failure probability (DFP). Network performance is evaluated either by an analytical approach or by a software tool able to simulate a one-lane highway scenario. Both steady-state and transition situations are considered. System performance in terms of PSP (in the presence of two-way Rice fading, noise, and interference with antenna diversity and selection combining) is analytically evaluated to validate the simulation tool and to prove the suitability of an MH network strategy. The simulation approach allows the evaluation of the impact of protocol parameters on network performance, with reference to nonsteady-state situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/25/14240/00653073.pdf","startPage":"992","endPage":"1005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.653073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.653073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=653073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop R-ALOHA for intervehicle communications at millimeter waves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Road transportation","Interference","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Diversity reception","Access protocols","Spread spectrum communication","Failure analysis","Software tools","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","traffic information systems","land mobile radio","packet radio networks","data communication","millimetre wave propagation","cochannel interference","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop R-ALOHA","intervehicle communications","millimeter waves","road transport information applications","highway environment","cooperative driving","R-ALOHA protocol","random access","interference","thermal noise","propagation","packet capture effect","packet success probability","system stabilization time","first success time","deadline failure probability","network performance","simulation tool","nonsteady-state situations","steady-state situation","60 to 64 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multihop R-ALOHA for intervehicle communications at millimeter waves","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5763632","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop R-ALOHA for intervehicle communications at millimeter waves","sourcePdf":"00653073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042762S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"51","articleId":"653073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":653074,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The design of error control schemes for such channels and their performance evaluation is simplified if appropriate generative models of the overall communication link are available. This paper presents a new class of generative models based on the interconnection of hidden Markov submodels parameterized by the Baum-Welch algorithm. The method has some resemblance to the well-studied problem of speech recognition of isolated words; however, in our approach, instead of dealing with words, one deals with error bursts, and the final goal is to generate bursts rather than to recognize words. The proposed model is particularly suitable for simulating error profiles with long bursts, as is often the case in indoor radio channels, where the error-free gaps inside a burst are heavily nonrenewal. The merits of the method are corroborated by applying the technique to two particular examples of indoor code-division multiple-access (CDMA) radio links.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/25/14240/00653074.pdf","startPage":"1006","endPage":"1020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.653074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.653074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=653074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov models for burst error characterization in indoor radio channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Indoor radio communication","Computer errors","Character generation","Error correction","Speech recognition","Multiaccess communication","Computer simulation","Error analysis","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","hidden Markov models","digital radio","code division multiple access","radio links","telecommunication channels","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst error characterization","hidden Markov models","indoor radio channels","digital communication channels","error control schemes","performance evaluation","generative models","Baum-Welch algorithm","error profiles","long bursts","CDMA radio links","code-division multiple-access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov models for burst error characterization in indoor radio channels","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5763633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov models for burst error characterization in indoor radio channels","sourcePdf":"00653074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069314S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"37","articleId":"653074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":653077,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

This analytical model explicates the path loss as a result of signal reduction due to free space wavefront spreading, multiple diffraction past rows of buildings, and building shadowing. It is applicable for cellular mobile services as well as personal communications services (PCS) in both macro- and microcellular environments. Good accuracy was found for this analytical model by comparing the predictions with numerous measurements made in various propagation environments. However, since the analytical model involves multiple-dimension integration to calculate the signal attenuation due to multiple diffraction past rows of buildings, the model in its original format does not lend itself to easy implementation into a radio system planning tool. A simplified version of the analytical model is developed in this paper, which can be used for three different propagation scenarios with base-station antenna above, below, and near the average rooftop level.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/25/14240/00653077.pdf","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.653077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.653077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=653077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified analytical model for predicting path loss in urban and suburban environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Personal communication networks","Predictive models","Shadow mapping","Land mobile radio","Attenuation","Diffraction","Antennas and propagation","Systems engineering and theory","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF radio propagation","personal communication networks","cellular radio","land mobile radio","electromagnetic wave diffraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytical model","path loss prediction","suburban environments","urban environments","propagation model","radio signal attenuation","free space wavefront spreading","multiple diffraction","building shadowing","cellular mobile services","personal communications services","microcellular environments","macrocellular environments","multiple-dimension integration","signal attenuation","radio system planning tool","base-station antenna","average rooftop level","mobile radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"A simplified analytical model for predicting path loss in urban and suburban environments","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5763636","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified analytical model for predicting path loss in urban and suburban environments","sourcePdf":"00653077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033257S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"90","articleId":"653077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":653078,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Nowhere is this more significant than in AI, where we are attempting to emulate some of the most sophisticated and complex forms of behavior. It is a reasonable assertion that intelligent systems cannot be simplified-that their behavior is necessarily a result of their immense complexity. If we are to make intelligent computer programs, they must be complex. If that complexity exceeds our ability to manage it by conventional top-down modes of thought, then we must find another way. To do this, we need to understand how anarchy works. One of the largest anarchies on the face of this planet is your own body. Perhaps the most striking feature of complex organisms is their cellularity. A cell's most significant feature is its membrane. The membrane's purpose is to keep the outside out and the inside in. Modern software uses a similar concept to isolate components from each other, through the object-oriented programming methodology. In many respects, the biological concept of cellularity is applicable to computer software, especially if you have a predilection for designing bottom-up, massively parallel simulations for creating intelligent artificial life-forms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/5254/14242/00653217.pdf","doi":"10.1109/5254.653217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5254.653217","startPage":"4","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anarchy in action [AI software complexity]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653217/","displayDocTitle":"Anarchy in action [AI software complexity]","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5852259","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anarchy in action [AI software complexity]","sourcePdf":"00653217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018795S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","isNumber":"14242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5254","citationCount":"1","articleId":"653217","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":653226,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Unfortunately, clinicians did not employ these initial versions in their daily routine. This article describes our recent redesign of VIE-PNN using an HTML-based client-server architecture. We have integrated this tool into the intranet of workstations that runs a clinic's patient data management system. Its acceptance among physicians has been immediate. Two neonatal ICUs at the University of Vienna have put this integrated version into daily use.

The upper state is obtained by means of low-temperature annealing, while illumination degrades the lifetime towards the value of the lower state. In order to improve the understanding of this phenomenon, we performed comprehensive carrier lifetime measurements on solar- and electronic-grade boron, gallium, and phosphorus doped Cz wafers obtained from different manufacturers. Based on the experimental results, a new model is introduced which attributes the disappointingly low stable lifetimes of illuminated boron-doped Cz silicon with resistivity around 1 /spl Omega/cm to boron-oxygen pairs. From this model, simple recipes are derived which might lead to an improvement of the efficiency of commercial Cz silicon solar cells.","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.1997.653914","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Twenty Sixth IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference - 1997","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Twenty Sixth IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference - 1997","pdfPath":"/iel4/5262/14261/00653914.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.1997.653914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of carrier lifetime instabilities in Cz-grown silicon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=653914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-3 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653914/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of carrier lifetime instabilities in Cz-grown silicon","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5883766","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of carrier lifetime instabilities in Cz-grown silicon","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00653914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101362S","chronDate":"29 Sep-3 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5262","citationCount":"107","articleId":"653914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":653944,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.

The system is comprised of many DC/DC power converters connected in parallel. Each power converter has its own single control loop operating in either the voltage regulation or current-limiting mode. Performance limitations are discovered through system simulation. Nonuniform current sharing occurs despite voltage droop characteristics that facilitate near-uniform current distribution. Due to random mismatches in component values, uneven current sharing among power converters exists. This causes system performance characteristics to exhibit large variations and system current sharing is found to be far from uniform, resulting in poor system reliability. The achievement of near-uniform current distribution, stiff system output voltage and the reduction of the output impedance variances are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/653999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5863983","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance limitations of random current-sharing parallel-connected converter systems and their solution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance limitations of random current-sharing parallel-connected converter systems and their solution","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00653999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027344S","chronDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5223","citationCount":"12","articleId":"653999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":654000,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It should be noted that higher common mode dv/dt at the motor terminals results in: (i) higher induced shaft voltage at each dv/dt transition, which can result in bearing currents and cause pitting/fluting of the bearings, and (ii) higher leakage currents to ground which can interfere with the plant zero sequence protection system. The paper proposes a method to reduce these effects. An input/output filter topology with interconnection to DC-link midpoint is proposed. This method reduces both common mode and differential mode dv/dt at the motor terminals, permits the use of long motor leads, and the filter components can be installed within the rectifier/inverter enclosure. Finally experimental results are presented on a 20 kW PWM ASD test stand.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5864005","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A method to reduce common mode and differential mode dv/dt at the motor terminals in PWM rectifier/PWM inverter type adjustable speed drive systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method to reduce common mode and differential mode dv/dt at the motor terminals in PWM rectifier/PWM inverter type adjustable speed drive systems","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00654021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03103S","chronDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5223","citationCount":"7","articleId":"654021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":654025,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Cash","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Cash","id":"37369064200"},{"name":"T.G.

The use of class E amplifiers in fluorescent lamps ballasts presents large advantages such as: high power density; simple structure (only one transistor); high efficiency; and optimum lamp driving. The class E amplifier uses a capacitive impedance inverter as the resonant tank and one diode in antiparallel with the switch; these elements allow the implementation of a dimming feature for the ballast. One of the main applications of this ballast is the supply of fluorescent lamps from solar cells. The design process has been simplified obtaining several characteristics and using mathematical programs.

This method requires neither a large-signal model nor load-pull measurements, giving relatively accurate results. LSBP (Large-Signal Bias Point: shifted bias point at large-signal input) is predicted by waveform analysis, and small-signal S-parameters at LSBP are used in designing the matching circuits. Harmonic loading theory is adopted for high efficiency operation, but it is modified to apply to real devices. Many parasitic effects are fully analyzed, and it is proved that the finite output resistance limits the power efficiency. A 2 GHz band power amplifier is designed by the proposed method, and its output characteristics validate the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.1997.654591","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel4/5255/14243/00654591.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"516 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1997.654591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of high efficiency power amplifier using DC and small-signal S-parameter measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design of high efficiency power amplifier using DC and small-signal S-parameter measurements","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"6032917","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of high efficiency power amplifier using DC and small-signal S-parameter measurements","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"00654591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024166S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5255","citationCount":"1","articleId":"654591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":654594,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The FDTD algorithm provides more accurate results than analytical solutions and proves to be an excellent tool for analyzing quasi-optical device grids.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel4/5255/14243/00654675.pdf","startPage":"849","endPage":"852 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1997.654675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.1997.654675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=654675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD simulation of quasi-optical device grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Optical arrays","Dielectric substrates","Reflection","Impedance","Frequency","Phased arrays","Diodes","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","arrays","power combiners","millimetre wave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-optical device grids","FDTD simulation","grid characteristics","MM-wave quasi-optical array","millimeter wave type","grid impedance","equivalent circuit parameters","metal grids","GaAs substrate","EHF","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"FDTD simulation of quasi-optical device grids","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"6032967","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD simulation of quasi-optical device grids","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00654675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036524S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5255","citationCount":"1","articleId":"654675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":654676,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A wide range of relays can detect failure in a transmission line and prevent a total breakdown in the systems, but due to the non-healing characteristics of solid insulators, in most cases it might be too late to save the insulator after tracking initiation and growth. The method described here is employed mainly in detecting several conditions, such as discharges, leakage current, dry conditions, severe damage and tracking initiation. Initially a BPN (back propagation network) type NN (neural network) is trained with different signal types. Due to the nature of NN, which always require similar values of input nodes, the system uses the FFT (fast Fourier transform) of the input signal, which might have high amplitude frequency components other than the fundamental frequency depending an the condition of the surface.

In this paper, we describe a rigorous design of dielectric resonator (DR) filters applying the finite-element method (FEM). We first present a dual mode coupling technique which replaces classical DRs, coupling, and tuning screws, which are commonly used in dual-mode filters, by slotted DRs. Next, a new theoretical analysis based on the contribution to the dual-mode filter response of the first DR hybrid mode and of higher order modes is described. This analysis can be applied to any type of microwave dual-mode filter. It allows us to define a procedure which explains the presence and controls the position of the two transmission zeros in the filter responses. In this paper, this procedure has been applied to improve filtering performances of a dual-mode DR filter. Finally, a synthesis method is developed to rigorously design for the first time, a four- and an eight-pole slotted DR elliptic filters. The experimental results were obtained with no tuning and the theoretical ones show good agreement.","doi":"10.1109/22.654917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14247/00654917.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.654917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAD applying the finite-element method for dielectric-resonator filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=654917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654917/","displayDocTitle":"CAD applying the finite-element method for dielectric-resonator filters","volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5818721","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAD applying the finite-element method for dielectric-resonator filters","sourcePdf":"00654917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048032S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","articleId":"654917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":654920,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

A new, simplified, but more effective calibration procedure has also been devised and tested. Results show that the calibration procedure leads to improvements which are independent of the type of radiator used. Specifically, data-model match is found to increase by 0.4 dB in magnitude and 4/spl deg/ in phase for the monopoles and by 0.6 dB in magnitude and 7/spl deg/ in phase for the waveguides (on average) on a per measurement basis when the new calibration procedure is employed. Enhancements are also found in the reconstructed images obtained with the monopole system relative to waveguides. Improvements are observed in: 1) the recovered object shape; 2) the uniformity of the background; 3) edge detection; and 4) target property value recovery. Analyses of reconstructed images also suggest that there is a systematic decrease of approximately 10% in the reconstruction errors for the monopole system over its waveguide counterpart in single-target experiments and as much as a 20% decrease in multitarget cases. Results indicate that these enhancements stem from a better data-model match for the monopoles relative to waveguides which is consistent across the type of calibration procedure used. Comparisons of computations and measurements show an average improvement in data-model match of approximately 0.25 dB in magnitude and near 7/spl deg/ in phase in favor of the monopoles in this regard. Beyond this apparent imaging performance enhancement, the monopole system offers economy-of-space and low construction-cost considerations along with computational advantages (as described herein) which make it a compelling choice as a radiator/receiver element around which to construct a clinically viable near-field microwave imaging system.","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14247/00654920.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.654920","doi":"10.1109/22.654920","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=654920","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave imaging","Biological materials","Calibration","Image reconstruction","Phase measurement","Conducting materials","Prototypes","Testing","Shape","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave imaging","biomedical imaging","image reconstruction","calibration","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-field microwave imaging","biological material","monopole transceiver","single target imaging","multitarget imaging","calibration","data model match","image reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Near-field microwave imaging of biologically-based materials using a monopole transceiver system","accessionNumber":"5818724","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-field microwave imaging of biologically-based materials using a monopole transceiver system","sourcePdf":"00654920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046684S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"101","articleId":"654920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":654926,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Hao","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"lastName":"Yang Hao","id":"37286956600"},{"name":"C.J.

Simulation results are presented and compared to those using other methods.","doi":"10.1109/22.654926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14247/00654926.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.654926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14247","startPage":"82","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing electromagnetic structures with curved boundaries on Cartesian FDTD meshes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=654926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing electromagnetic structures with curved boundaries on Cartesian FDTD meshes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5818730","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing electromagnetic structures with curved boundaries on Cartesian FDTD meshes","sourcePdf":"00654926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039656S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"61","articleId":"654926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":654927,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanxun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yuanxun Wang","id":"37281421000"},{"name":"Hao Ling","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hao Ling","id":"37278491900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"654927","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter extraction","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Computational modeling","Signal resolution","Two dimensional displays","Fourier transforms","Parameter estimation","Microstrip","Propagation constant"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","transmission line theory","Fourier transforms","parameter estimation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimode parameter extraction","multiconductor transmission lines","single-pass FDTD","signal-processing techniques","broadband multimode parameters","guided wave structures","finite-difference time-domain simulation","2D Fourier transform algorithm","super-resolution estimation","signal parameters","rotational invariance technique","ESPRIT algorithm","three-line coupled microstrip structure","propagation constants","modal-field templates","modal impedances"]}],"abstract":"We present two approaches to extract the broadband multimode parameters of guided wave structures from a single-pass finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation.

In power supply systems, they are typically cascaded onto switching regulators to suppress noise and provide a low noise output. The need for low voltage is innate to portable low power devices and corroborated by lower breakdown voltages resulting from reductions in feature size. Low quiescent current in a battery-operated system is an intrinsic performance parameter because it partially determines battery life. This paper discusses some techniques that enable the practical realizations of low quiescent current LDO's at low voltages and in existing technologies. The proposed circuit exploits the frequency response dependence on load-current to minimize quiescent current flow. Moreover, the output current capabilities of MOS power transistors are enhanced and drop-out voltages are decreased for a given device size. Other applications, like dc-dc converters, can also reap the benefits of these enhanced MOS devices. An LDO prototype incorporating the aforementioned techniques was fabricated. The circuit was operable down to input voltages of 1 V with a zero-load quiescent current flow of 23 /spl mu/A. Moreover, the regulator provided 18 and 50 mA of output current at input voltages of 1 and 1.2 V, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/4.654935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.654935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/14258/00654935.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-voltage, low quiescent current, low drop-out regulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"A low-voltage, low quiescent current, low drop-out regulator","volume":"33","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5804487","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654935/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-voltage, low quiescent current, low drop-out regulator","sourcePdf":"00654935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038277S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"461","articleId":"654935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":654937,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In fact, a commercial analog class-IV partial-response sequence detector for magnetic read channels has already been reported. Analog decoders offer the advantages of reduced power and size primarily due to the elimination of the A/D. The analog Viterbi decoder described here is less complex and more robust compared to other reported realizations. The decoder is based on a new derivation of the difference-metric algorithm which is developed from an analog implementation perspective. This has resulted in a decrease in hardware complexity thereby making an analog approach more attractive for today's demanding high-speed, low-power, and small-size applications, such as magnetic disk-drive storage systems. The decoder was fabricated in a 0.8-/spl mu/m BiCMOS process. It consists of two time-interleaved dicodes and the interleaving circuitry. The decoder was tested at up to 100 MS/s.

The stator flux can be determined accurately from the terminal voltage when the machine is operating at high speed. However, at low speed, the stator resistance must be known to calculate the stator flux. The problem of calculating the stator flux accurately over the entire speed range is addressed. The rotor flux can be found from the machine speed and rotor time constant. The stator flux, at low speed, is then calculated directly from the rotor flux. By alternating between these two methods of determining the stator flux, a self-tuning operation is achieved, wherein the stator and rotor resistances are periodically updated. Since both methods of determining the stator flux are forced to track one another, a smooth transition between flux estimators is obtained. The torque and flux are then controlled in a deadbeat fashion. Good torque control over a wide speed range can therefore be obtained. With the proposed scheme, the advantages of direct torque control are obtained over the entire speed range with the addition of a speed sensor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5805583","volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stator resistance tuning in a stator-flux field-oriented drive using an instantaneous hybrid flux estimator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stator resistance tuning in a stator-flux field-oriented drive using an instantaneous hybrid flux estimator","sourcePdf":"00654966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029131S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"86","articleId":"654966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":654975,"authors":[{"name":"Yungtaek Jang","affiliation":["Delta Power Electronics Laboratory, Inc., Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Yungtaek Jang","id":"37291203100"},{"name":"R.W.

By using a multiresonant scheme, the transistor operates with zero-current switching (ZCS), and the diodes operate with zero-voltage switching (ZVS). These multiresonant rectifiers with a single transistor are capable of drawing a higher quality input-current waveform at nearly unity power factor and lower stresses than quasi-resonant rectifiers. Buck-type converters are used for the power stage, and, hence, the output voltage is lower than the input voltage. Moreover, these rectifiers have a wide load range and low stresses on semiconductor devices. From the analysis, normalized characteristics of the rectifier are derived. The design and breadboard implementation of the rectifier delivering 147 V/sub dc/ at 6 kW from a 3/spl phi/ 240-V/sub rms(LL)/ input is described. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the line current is less than 5%, and the system efficiency is about 94% at the full load.","doi":"10.1109/63.654975","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"194","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/63/14257/00654975.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.654975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New single-switch three-phase high-power-factor rectifiers using multiresonant zero-current switching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectifiers","Zero current switching","Pulse width modulation","Stress","Zero voltage switching","Semiconductor diodes","Reactive power","Semiconductor devices","Total harmonic distortion","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching circuits","power factor correction","rectifying circuits","resonant power convertors","power system harmonics","harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-switch three-phase high-power-factor rectifiers","multiresonant zero-current switching","continuous input current","continuous output current","transistor operation","zero-current switching","ZCS","zero-voltage switching","ZVS","higher quality input-current waveform","nearly unity power factor","quasi-resonant rectifiers","buck-type converters","output voltage","semiconductor devices","total harmonic distortion","THD","line current","system efficiency","147 V","6 kW","240 V","94 percent"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"New single-switch three-phase high-power-factor rectifiers using multiresonant zero-current switching","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5805591","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654975/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New single-switch three-phase high-power-factor rectifiers using multiresonant zero-current switching","sourcePdf":"00654975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02608S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"42","articleId":"654975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":654978,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

Also a new property of optical orthogonal code (OOC) sequences is introduced which greatly increases the number of sequences in the network. Performance analysis of the two systems is done using as the parameter the number of simultaneous different-rate users as a function of the required probabilities of error.

It is assumed that the optical channel is an intensity modulated (IM) channel and that the received optical signal is detected using a direct-detection (DD) scheme. Two modes of operation are considered. In one scenario, it is assumed that the receiver is limited by shot noise (i.e., negligible receiver thermal noise, or Poisson channel). In the other case, we consider a nonnegligible receiver thermal noise where an avalanche photodetector (APD) is employed to detect the received optical signal. It is also considered that the modulation scheme is the binary pulse-position modulation (PPM). With the aid of the best available upper bounds, the performance of the rate 1/n PCCC encoded optical PPM systems is assessed in terms of the upper bound on the system bit error rate (BER) for the shot-noise-limited IM/DD systems with nonnegligible background noise and for the thermal-noise-limited systems with APD detectors when a uniform interleaver is used. Numerical results for the rate 1/3 PCCC encoded PPM channels are presented. The numerical results demonstrate the enormous potential of this novel coding scheme in enhancing the performance of the aforementioned optical channels by a sizeable margin across the board.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"18","endPage":"26","doi":"10.1109/50.654979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.654979","pdfPath":"/iel3/50/14259/00654979.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo-coded optical PPM communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Turbo-coded optical PPM communication systems","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5803939","volume":"16","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo-coded optical PPM communication systems","sourcePdf":"00654979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02889S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"35","articleId":"654979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":654981,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our theory consists of two parts: a large-signal analysis yielding the transmission function for the signal, and a small-signal analysis in order to describe the transformation of the signal and probe intensity noise. Both the large-signal as well as the small-signal theory reveal similar performance for the co- and the counterpropagating injection scheme for bit rates up to 2.5 Gb/s. This is confirmed by computer simulations. Consequently, the counterpropagating configuration is preferable because the implementation is simpler and conversion to the same wavelength is possible. In order to increase the conversion efficiency it is better to reduce the average signal power than to increase the probe power, which additionally reduces the output power range. However, there is a tradeoff between conversion efficiency and output extinction ratio. According to the small-signal analysis, the relative-intensity noise (RIN) due to the probe and due to the amplified spontaneous emission is negligible. Moreover, the converted signal has a lower RIN than the input signal.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Probes","Signal analysis","Semiconductor device noise","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Bit rate","Computer simulation","Wavelength conversion","Power generation","Extinction ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superradiance","laser noise","semiconductor device noise","performance evaluation","optical frequency conversion","wavelength division multiplexing","electro-optical modulation","semiconductor device models","laser theory","optical transmitters","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","wavelength converters","cross-gain modulation","semiconductor-optical amplifiers","all-optical wavelength converters","large-signal analysis","transmission function","small-signal analysis","probe intensity noise","signal intensity noise","counterpropagating injection scheme","copropagating injection scheme","conversion efficiency","average signal power","power range","output extinction ratio","relative-intensity noise","amplified spontaneous emission","input signal","WDM","optical transmitters","2.5 Gbit/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.654987","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/50/14259/00654987.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.654987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of wavelength converters based on cross-gain modulation in semiconductor-optical amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=654987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of wavelength converters based on cross-gain modulation in semiconductor-optical amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/654987/","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5803946","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of wavelength converters based on cross-gain modulation in semiconductor-optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00654987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051317S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"82","articleId":"654987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":654993,"authors":[{"name":"D.A. van Blerkom","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"D.A.","lastName":"van Blerkom","id":"37354223100"},{"name":"Chi Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chi Fan","id":"37349376300"},{"name":"M.

The system considered is described by an unknown NARMA model, and a feedforward neural network is used to learn the system. Taking the neural network as a neural model of the system, control signals are directly obtained by minimizing either the instant difference or the cumulative differences between a set point and the output of the neural model. Since the training algorithm guarantees that the output of the neural model approaches that of the actual system, it is shown that the control signals obtained can also make the real system output close to the set point. An application to a flow-rate control system is included to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and desired results are obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct adaptive neural-network control for unknown nonlinear systems and its application","doi":"10.1109/72.655026","endPage":"34","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/14264/00655026.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.655026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655026","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Automatic control","Feedforward neural networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear systems","neurocontrollers","feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptive control","robust control","autoregressive moving average processes","flow control","process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct adaptive control","nonlinear systems","NARMA model","feedforward neural network","learning","neurocontrol","set point","flow-rate control","fault tolerant control","multilayer perceptrons","optimisation","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A direct adaptive neural-network control for unknown nonlinear systems and its application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5813833","pubMedId":"18252426","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direct adaptive neural-network control for unknown nonlinear systems and its application","sourcePdf":"00655026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032537S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"177","articleId":"655026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":655027,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Our main result is that for any /spl kappa//sub d/<d!2/sup d-1//(2d)!, and 0/spl les//spl rho/<1/2, a Hebbian higher order neural network of order d with n neurons can store a random set of /spl kappa//sub d/n/sup d//log n fundamental memories such that almost all memories have an attraction radius of size /spl rho/n. If /spl kappa//sub d/<d!2/sup d-1//((2d)!(d+1)), then all memories possess this property simultaneously. It indicates that the lower bounds on the long-term attraction capacities are larger than the corresponding direct convergence capacities by a factor of 1/(1-2/spl rho/)/sup 2d/. In addition we upper bound the convergence rate (number of iterations required to converge). This bound is asymptotically independent of n.

To reduce the communication cost as well as the time of learning process in ANNs, we earlier proposed (1995) an incremental internode communication method. In the incremental communication method, instead of communicating the full magnitude of the output value of a node, only the increment or decrement to its previous value is sent to a communication link. In this paper, the effects of the limited precision incremental communication method on the convergence behavior and performance of multilayer neural networks are investigated. The nonlinear aspects of representing the incremental values with reduced (limited) precision for the commonly used error backpropagation training algorithm are analyzed. It is shown that the nonlinear effect of small perturbations in the input(s)/output of a node does not cause instability. The analysis is supported by simulation studies of two problems. The simulation results demonstrate that the limited precision errors are bounded and do not seriously affect the convergence of multilayer neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/72.655031","startPage":"68","endPage":"82","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/14264/00655031.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.655031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental communication for multilayer neural networks: error analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Neural networks","Error analysis","Artificial neural networks","Degradation","Convergence","Computational modeling","Costs","Backpropagation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","backpropagation","error analysis","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental communication","multilayer neural networks","error analysis","internode communications","learning process","convergence","error backpropagation","nonlinear effect","perturbations","finite precision computation","multilayer perceptrons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Incremental communication for multilayer neural networks: error analysis","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5813837","pubMedId":"18252431","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental communication for multilayer neural networks: error analysis","sourcePdf":"00655031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089353S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"4","articleId":"655031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":655032,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Qing Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Applied Sciences, Georgia Southwestern State University, Americus, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Yan-Qing Zhang","id":"37087164670"},{"name":"A.

In this paper, given at least as many sensors as components, we propose a simpler approach which independently extracts each component with one neuron. The weights of the neuron are optimized by minimizing an even polynomial of its output. The corresponding adaptive algorithm is an extended anti-Hebbian rule with very low complexity. It can extract any specific negative kurtosis component. Global stability of the algorithm is investigated as well as steady-state fluctuations. The influence of additive noise is also considered.

Hand gestures are mapped continuously to ten control parameters of a parallel formant speech synthesizer. The mapping allows the hand to act as an artificial vocal tract that produces speech in real time. This gives an unlimited vocabulary in addition to direct control of fundamental frequency and volume. Currently, the best version of Glove-TalkII uses several input devices (including a Cyberglove, a ContactGlove, a three-space tracker, and a foot pedal), a parallel formant speech synthesizer, and three neural networks. The gesture-to-speech task is divided into vowel and consonant production by using a gating network to weight the outputs of a vowel and a consonant neural network. The gating network and the consonant network are trained with examples from the user. The vowel network implements a fixed user-defined relationship between hand position and vowel sound and does not require any training examples from the user. Volume, fundamental frequency, and stop consonants are produced with a fixed mapping from the input devices. One subject has trained to speak intelligibly with Glove-TalkII. He speaks slowly but with far more natural sounding pitch variations than a text-to-speech synthesizer.","doi":"10.1109/72.655042","startPage":"205","endPage":"212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/14264/00655042.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.655042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Glove-TalkII-a neural-network interface which maps gestures to parallel formant speech synthesizer controls","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech synthesis","Synthesizers","Neural networks","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Vocabulary","Frequency","Bandwidth","Intelligent robots","Data gloves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech synthesis","user interfaces","data gloves","handicapped aids","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Glove-TalkII","neural-network interface","parallel formant speech synthesizer controls","hand gestures","adaptive interface","artificial vocal tract","Cyberglove","ContactGlove","three-space tracker","foot pedal","gesture-to-speech task","consonant production","vowel production","gating network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Glove-TalkII-a neural-network interface which maps gestures to parallel formant speech synthesizer controls","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5813848","pubMedId":"18252442","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Glove-TalkII-a neural-network interface which maps gestures to parallel formant speech synthesizer controls","sourcePdf":"00655042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042541S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"62","articleId":"655042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":655044,"authors":[{"name":"Hou Chunhai","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Process Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hou Chunhai","id":"37087868788"},{"name":"Qian Jixin","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Process Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qian Jixin","id":"37087150908"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"655044","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655044","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Delay effects","Delay estimation","Stability criteria","Neural networks","Asymptotic stability","Circuits","Transfer functions","Associative memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","dynamics","transfer functions","stability criteria","neural nets","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","neural dynamics","time-varying delays","additive neural-network model","delay-independent stability criterion","decay estimates","asymptotic stability","neuronal activations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/72.655044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/14264/00655044.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.655044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis for neural dynamics with time-varying delays","abstract":"By using the usual additive neural-network model, a delay-independent stability criterion for neural dynamics with perturbations of time-varying delays is derived.

The asymptotic stability is global in the state space of neuronal activations. From the techniques used in this paper, it is shown that our criterion ensures stability of neural dynamics even when the delay functions vary violently with time.

However, these results have been obtained for the case when the activation function for the hidden neurons is the signum function. This paper rigorously proves that standard single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) with at most N hidden neurons and with any bounded nonlinear activation function which has a limit at one infinity can learn N distinct samples (x/sub i/,t/sub i/) with zero error. The previous method of arbitrarily choosing weights is not feasible for any SLFN. The proof of our result is constructive and thus gives a method to directly find the weights of the standard SLFNs with any such bounded nonlinear activation function as opposed to iterative training algorithms in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5813851","pubMedId":"18252445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Upper bounds on the number of hidden neurons in feedforward networks with arbitrary bounded nonlinear activation functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upper bounds on the number of hidden neurons in feedforward networks with arbitrary bounded nonlinear activation functions","sourcePdf":"00655045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073825S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"355","articleId":"655045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655059,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The novel features of the system function lie in noninvasive and unrestrained monitoring to ensure the symbiosis with the human. Noninvasive monitoring eliminates the need for monitoring needles or catheters to invade the patient's body; sensors thus do not impose a physiological burden such as pain on the patient. In unrestrained monitoring, sensors and their electrical cords do not limit degrees of freedom of the patient's movement. Unrestrained sensing therefore does not impose a psychological burden caused by the limitations on the patient. A \"robotic bed\", which is a system to realize the functions stated above, is a bed-shaped system with 221 pressure sensors for monitoring the patient's respiration and posture without preventing doctors and nurses from performing their tasks. The sensors are set 5 cm from each other on the bed and surround the patient. Experiments to monitor respiration and posture in sleep demonstrate that the proposed function is feasible for monitoring for over 6 hours.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1997.655078","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robot and Systems.

This enables the control of a robot in look-and-move mode to achieve six degree of freedom goal configurations. Robust solutions of the correspondence problem-known as \"matching\" in the static case and \"tracking\" in the dynamic one-are crucial to the feasibility of such an approach in real-world environments. The object's motion along an arbitrary trajectory in space is tracked using visual pose estimates through consecutive images. Subsequent positions are predicted from robot joint angle measurements. To deal with inaccurate models and to relax calibration requirements, adaptive online calibration of the kinematic chain is proposed. The kinematic predictions enable unambiguous feature matching by a pessimistic algorithm. The performance of the suggested algorithms and the robustness of the proposed system are evaluated on real image sequences of a moving gripper. The results fulfill the requirements of visual servoing, and the computational demands are sufficiently low to allow for real-time implementation.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1997.655115","pdfPath":"/iel4/5229/14235/00655115.pdf","startPage":"893","endPage":"899 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robot and Systems.

Previous solutions to this problem computed paths made up of circular arcs connected by tangential line segments. Such paths have a discontinuous curvature profile. Accordingly a vehicle following such a path has to stop at each curvature discontinuity in order to re-orientate its front wheels. To remove this limitation, we add a continuous-curvature constraint to the problem at hand. In addition, we introduce a constraint on the curvature derivative, so as to reflect the fact that a car-like vehicle can only re-orientate its front wheels with a finite velocity. We propose an efficient solution to the problem at hand that relies upon the definition of a set of paths with continuous curvature and maximum curvature derivative. These paths contain at most eight pieces, each piece being either a line segment, a circular arc of maximum curvature, or a clothoid arc. They are called simple continuous curvature paths. They are used to design a local path planner. The experimental results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Sep 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-11 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5843099","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Continuous-curvature path planning for car-like vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous-curvature path planning for car-like vehicles","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"00655130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032567S","chronDate":"7-11 Sep 1997","isNumber":"14235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5229","citationCount":"70","articleId":"655130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":655134,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Since COPIS observes a 360 degree view around the robot, it can observe global information of features (azimuths of vertical edges). On the other hand, binocular vision can obtain a sequence of stereo images although a field of view is limited by the visual angle of lens. In this paper, we integrate merits of omnidirectional vision and binocular vision, and propose an efficient sensing system for generating an environmental map by using MISS. Without an assumption of the exact known motion of the robot, MISS can generate an environmental map and estimate egomotion of the robot from both sensory information sources. In particular, the method is suitable for map generation during long robot movement because deadlocking error of the robot does not accumulate. The system has been evaluated on a prototype of MISS in a real environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robot and Systems.

The object to be grasped is the rod on a bifilar suspension. The upper ends of the fibers are attached to the stable beam which holds a TV camera connected to a computer. Data processing results in the coordinates of the end points of the rod. The algorithm developed gives the possibility to obtain up to 25 pairs of end points per second. The data are subjected to statistical analysis taking into account the dynamic model of the rod motion. The results obtained for the 0.5 s interval allow us to calculate the initial conditions of the rod motion and to predict the motion to several seconds ahead. Analysis of the predicted motion allows us to determine the proper moment of capture, and the position of the manipulator grip at that moment. The capture is implemented in 2-5 s after the start of the process, within 1-2 periods of longitudinal and lateral modes of the rod oscillation.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1997.655143","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robot and Systems.

The kinematic design is optimized by the AMEA which uses both binary and real encoding (for kinematic and configuration parameters). In the problem considered for illustration, the robotic system consists in a mobile base and a manipulator arm which may be built with serially assembled link and joint modules. The manipulator has to reach a predefined set of goal frames in a 3D cluttered environment. Its design is evaluated with geometric and kinematic performance measures. Optimization results for a 3D task are given and compared with a simple genetic algorithm. They clearly show the superiority of the multi-chromosome representation and adaptive operators in term of computing time and criteria optimization performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robot and Systems.

By this method, a velocity signal of the heart wall with a small amplitude of less than 10 /spl mu/m on the motion resulting from a heartbeat with large amplitude of 10 mm can be successfully detected with sufficient reproducibility in the frequency range up to several hundred Hertz continuously for periods of about 10 heartbeats. In this paper, the method is applied to multiple points preset in the left ventricular (LV) wall along the ultrasonic beam so that the spatial (depth) distributions of the velocity at these points are simultaneously obtained. The motion of the heart wall is divided into the following two components: parallel global motion of the heart wall and the change in myocardial layer thickening at each depth across the LV wall during myocardial contraction/relaxation. The latter component is superimposed on the M (motion) mode image using a color code to map contraction as red and expansion as blue. By preliminary human studies, the principle of the method proposed in this paper is verified and the frequency band of the components generated by thickening and/or thinning in the myocardium is identified. This new approach offers potential for research on noninvasive acoustical diagnosis of myocardial local motility, that is, the myocardial layer function at each depth in the ventricular wall.","doi":"10.1109/58.655190","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14267/00655190.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"752","endPage":"768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noninvasive evaluation of local myocardial thickening and its color-coded imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"Noninvasive evaluation of local myocardial thickening and its color-coded imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655190/","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5654863","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noninvasive evaluation of local myocardial thickening and its color-coded imaging","sourcePdf":"00655190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065279S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"14267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"148","articleId":"655190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":655192,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

In some cases these inhomogeneities may be modeled as a thin time delay screen located at the face of the transducer. The effects of such near-field aberrations can be reduced by adding compensating time delays to the normal system focusing delays. Unfortunately array elements are generally large in at least one dimension when compared to variations in the aberrator, thus correction of the mean time delay on an element leaves residual variations in the time delay profile across that element. This paper presents theoretical expressions and simulation results describing the magnitude of this aberrator integration error. Simulations results are also presented which show the distortion of received pulses and degradation of point spread functions which results from aberrator integration error. These results indicate that aberrator integration error may be the dominant source of error in the implementation of adaptive imaging techniques and in phase aberration measurements. Thus, correction of near-field aberrations may be significantly more difficult than previously suspected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655192/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5654865","publicationDate":"July 1997","displayDocTitle":"Aberrator integration error in adaptive imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aberrator integration error in adaptive imaging","sourcePdf":"00655192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058415S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"14267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"19","articleId":"655192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":655196,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Spatial and temporal field quantities were determined for spherically focused transducers in the frequency range from 3 to 17 MHz, and a comparison with hydrophone measurements showed that both techniques yielded comparable results for the low-frequency transducer. However, for the higher frequency transducers, hydrophone measurements did not yield satisfactory results compared to the wire-target technique due to the hydrophone's aperture size, while the results from the wire-target technique were in general agreement with theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655196/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","volume":"44","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5654869","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pulse-echo field distribution measurement technique for high-frequency ultrasound sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse-echo field distribution measurement technique for high-frequency ultrasound sources","sourcePdf":"00655196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027804S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"14267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"115","articleId":"655196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":655197,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojuen Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaojuen Yuan","id":"37365997800"},{"name":"D.

In this method, a plane wave pulse (broadband) is used to transmit and limited diffraction beams of different parameters are used to receive. Signals received are processed to obtain spatial Fourier transform of object functions and images are constructed with an inverse Fourier transform. Because only one transmission is required to construct images, this method may achieve a high frame rate (up to 3750 frames/s for biological soft tissues at a depth of 200 mm). To demonstrate the efficacy of the method, both 2D C-mode and 3D images have been simulated using conditions that are typical for medical ultrasound. Results show that images of high resolutions (about 6 wavelengths at 200 mm) and low sidelobes (around -60 dB) can be constructed over a large depth of interest (30 to 200 mm) with a 50 mm diameter aperture. Experiments with the new method have also been carried out. 2D B-mode images have been constructed with conventional linear arrays. In the experiment, an ATS 539 tissue-equivalent phantom and two linear arrays were used. The first array had a center frequency of 2.25 MHz, dimension of 18.288 mm/spl times//spl times/12.192 mm, and 48 elements. The second had a center frequency of 2.5 MHz, 38.4 mm/spl times/10 mm in dimension, and 64 elements. Images of different fields of views were constructed from RF data acquired with these arrays using both the new and conventional dynamic focusing (delay-and-sum) methods. Results show that qualities of images constructed are almost identical with the two methods in terms of sidelobes, contrast, and lateral and axial resolutions. Phase aberration has also been assessed for the two methods, and results show that its influence is about the same on both methods. In addition, a practical imaging system to implement the new method is suggested and potential applications of the method are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5654873","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"2D and 3D high frame rate imaging with limited diffraction beams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D and 3D high frame rate imaging with limited diffraction beams","sourcePdf":"00655200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02861S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"14267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"174","articleId":"655200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655202,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Both shivering in the hand of the operator and muscle vibrations in the patient itself give rise to the clutter. Clutter rejection filters are commonly used to remove the low frequency components, but the doppler signal from low velocity blood flow is then also lost. This paper describes a model for the pulsed wave (PW) doppler signal from vibrating muscles, reviews a model for the PW doppler signal from moving blood, and by comparing these models presents a theoretical minimum for detectable blood velocity in small vessels, being typically 6.4 mm/s for 6 MHz doppler. The limit has a nonlinear relation to the ultrasound frequency. The model also shows that the radial component of the muscle vibrations can be estimated from the phase of the doppler signal.","doi":"10.1109/58.655202","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14267/00655202.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"873","endPage":"881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound doppler measurements of low velocity blood flow: limitations due to clutter signals from vibrating muscles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound doppler measurements of low velocity blood flow: limitations due to clutter signals from vibrating muscles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655202/","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5654875","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound doppler measurements of low velocity blood flow: limitations due to clutter signals from vibrating muscles","sourcePdf":"00655202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111198S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"14267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"59","articleId":"655202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":655207,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These models can be broadly classified into two categories, namely, those that rely on the hysteresis loop and those that rely on the switching current of a ferroelectric capacitor. The former often involves a continuous cycling of a ferroelectric capacitor with a sinusoidal waveform. The latter employs a pulse measurement technique to capture the switching current of the capacitor. The pulse waveform applied to the ferroelectric capacitor in the latter approach resembles the actual waveform encountered in a typical ferroelectric memory access. This resemblance makes switching-current based models more suitable for use in high-speed-memory circuit simulations.","doi":"10.1109/58.655207","startPage":"917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14267/00655207.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655207","endPage":"924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of behavioral modeling of ferroelectric capacitors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"A survey of behavioral modeling of ferroelectric capacitors","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5654880","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of behavioral modeling of ferroelectric capacitors","sourcePdf":"00655207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048133S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"14267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"35","articleId":"655207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655212,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Rain cell observations at 118 GHz were compared with estimates of the cell-top altitude obtained by optical stereoscopy. The observations were made with 2-4-km horizontal spatial resolution by using the millimeter-wave temperature sounder (MTS) scanning spectrometer aboard the NASA ER-2 research aircraft during the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE) and the Cooperative Huntsville Meteorological Experiment (COHMEX) in 1986. The neural network estimator applied to MTS spectral differences between clouds, and nearby clear air yielded an rms discrepancy of 1.76 km for a combined cumulus, mature, and dissipating cell set and 1.44 km for the cumulus-only set. An improvement in rms discrepancy to 1.36 km was achieved by including additional MTS information on the absolute atmospheric temperature profile. An incremental method for training neural networks was developed that yielded robust results, despite the use of as few as 56 training spectra. Comparison of these results with a nonlinear statistical estimator shows that superior results can be obtained with a neural network retrieval system.

To demonstrate this ability, an ideal location is selected and several first principle assumptions are made to simplify the reflectivity model. Twenty-three 1-km advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) images are composited by using a Bayesian statistical sampling technique to yield estimates of a simple terrain-based reflectivity model with 180-m resolution. The terrain values are determined from a 90-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). The Bayesian technique uses the AVHRR data to iteratively determine the most likely values for the model spectral albedos contained within an AVHRR field of view. Model predicted radiances for the repeat AVHRR footprints are computed by integrating model albedo values over the AVHRR PSF. As a first-order verification, simulated AVHRR reflectivities are shown to reconstruct well a smoothly varying prescribed albedo field. Comparisons of the composited real AVHRR image result with Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS) data show that the model reconstruction resolves surface features, which are not resolved in a single AVHRR image.","doi":"10.1109/36.655333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.655333","endPage":"255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/14284/00655333.pdf","startPage":"244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Higher resolution Earth surface features from repeat moderate resolution satellite imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655333/","displayDocTitle":"Higher resolution Earth surface features from repeat moderate resolution satellite imagery","volume":"36","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5825653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher resolution Earth surface features from repeat moderate resolution satellite imagery","sourcePdf":"00655333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032486S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"12","articleId":"655333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655336,"authors":[{"name":"Yuei-An Liou","affiliation":["Center of Space and Remote Sensing Research, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuei-An Liou","id":"37087151523"},{"name":"A.W.

The authors present a physically based, one-dimensional (1D), coupled heat and moisture transport hydrology (1-DH) model for bare, unfrozen, moist soils subject to insolation, radiant heating and cooling, and sensible and latent heat exchanges with the atmosphere. A 60-day simulation is conducted to study the effect of dry-down on soil temperature and moisture distributions in summer for bare soil in the Midwest United States. Given a typical initial moisture content of 38% by volume, the authors find that temperature differences between the water transport and no water transport cases exhibit a diurnal oscillation with a slowly increasing amplitude, but never exceed 4.4 K for the 60-day period. However, moisture content of the surface decreases significantly with time for the water transport case and becomes only about 21% at the end of the same period. The 1-DH model is linked to a radiobrightness (1-DH/R) model as a potential means for soil moisture inversion. The model shows that radiobrightness thermal inertia (RTI) correlates with soil moisture if the two radiobrightnesses are taken from times near the thermal extremes, e.g., 2 a.m. and 2 p.m., and that RTI appears temperature-dependent at the ending stages of the drydown simulations where soils are dry and their moisture contents vary slowly. Near times of thermal crossover, the RTI technique is insensitive to soil moisture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655336/","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5825656","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"A land surface process/radiobrightness model with coupled heat and moisture transport in soil","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A land surface process/radiobrightness model with coupled heat and moisture transport in soil","sourcePdf":"00655336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102341S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"30","articleId":"655336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":655339,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

The conventional neural network classifier performs learning from the representative information within a problem domain on a one-pixel-one-class basis; therefore, class mixture and the degree of membership of a pixel are generally not taken into account, often resulting in a poor classification accuracy. Based on the framework of a dynamic learning neural network (DL), this communications proposes a fuzzy version (FDL) based on two steps: network representation of fuzzy logic and assignment of membership. Comparisons between the DL and FDL are made by applying both neural networks to SAR image classification. Experimental results show that the FDL has faster convergence rate than that of DL. In addition, the separability between similar classes is improved. Moreover, the classification results match better with ground truth.","doi":"10.1109/36.655339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14284","startPage":"301","endPage":"307","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/14284/00655339.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.655339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy neural network to SAR image classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Image classification","Neural networks","Fuzzy sets","Remote sensing","Fuzzy set theory","Fuzzy logic","Space technology","Testing","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical signal processing","geophysics computing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","radar imaging","image classification","fuzzy neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","land surface","terrain mapping","radar imaging","radar remote sensing","fuzzy neural network","neural net","SAR","image classification","synthetic aperture radar","classifier","dynamic learning neural network","fuzzy version","network representation","fuzzy logic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy neural network to SAR image classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5825659","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy neural network to SAR image classification","sourcePdf":"00655339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048859S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"67","articleId":"655339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":655348,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Although the gain of the device is polarization insensitive, we observed a strong variation of the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency if the parallel input polarization of pump and signal wave was changed with respect to the device structure. This variation, which is attributed to birefringence in the SOA, can be as high as 10 dB for frequency detunings of about 6 THz. Thus, it might strongly affect the various applications of FWM for optical signal processing and parameter extraction. In addition, we performed polarization resolved measurements of the amplified spontaneous emission demonstrating different group velocity indices for TE and TM polarized light.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.655361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/68/14285/00655361.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"214","doi":"10.1109/68.655361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of birefringence in a bulk semiconductor optical amplifier on four-wave mixing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Effect of birefringence in a bulk semiconductor optical amplifier on four-wave mixing","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5833518","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of birefringence in a bulk semiconductor optical amplifier on four-wave mixing","sourcePdf":"00655361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049316S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"27","articleId":"655361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":655363,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

In round-robin multiplexing, transmission slots are assigned periodically to each channel, With the adaptive scheme, the multiplexer selects at each time slot the channel whose state is estimated to have the lowest retransmission probability. The throughputs of these ARQ protocols under either multiplexing scheme are analyzed and compared. The present paper contains a description of the system model and an analysis of the ARQ protocols under both multiplexing schemes.

The dispersive CDMA channel is first cast into a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal model framework. By applying the theory of blind MIMO channel identification and equalization, it is then shown that under certain conditions the multiuser information symbols can be recovered without any prior knowledge of the channel or the users' signature waveforms (including the desired user's signature waveform), although the algorithmic complexity of such an approach is prohibitively high. However, in practice, the signature waveform of the user of interest is always available at the receiver. It is shown that by incorporating this knowledge, the impulse response of each user's dispersive channel can be identified using a subspace method. It is further shown that based on the identified signal subspace parameters and the channel response, two linear detectors that are capable of suppressing both MAI and ISI, i.e., a zero-forcing detector and a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector, can be constructed in closed form, at almost no extra computational cost. Data detection can then be furnished by applying these linear detectors (obtained blindly) to the received signal. The major contribution of this paper is the development of these subspace-based blind techniques for joint suppression of MAI and ISI in the dispersive CDMA channels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Multiuser detection","Dispersion","Multiaccess communication","Intersymbol interference","Multiple access interference","Detectors","MIMO","Demodulation","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","intersymbol interference","interference suppression","telecommunication channels","adaptive equalisers","MIMO systems","identification","transient response","adaptive signal detection","least mean squares methods","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersive CDMA channels","algorithmic complexity","multiuser detection","blind demodulation","multiuser information symbols","code-division multiple-access","high-rate CDMA network","multiple-access interference","intersymbol interference","ISI","multiple-input multiple-output signal model","interference suppression","blind MIMO channel identification","blind MIMO channel equalization","users signature waveform","impulse response","subspace method","linear detectors","zero-forcing detector","minimum-mean-square-error","MMSE detector","data detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655407","doi":"10.1109/26.655407","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14293/00655407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.655407","startPage":"91","endPage":"103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind equalization and multiuser detection in dispersive CDMA channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind equalization and multiuser detection in dispersive CDMA channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5825602","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind equalization and multiuser detection in dispersive CDMA channels","sourcePdf":"00655407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045414S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"331","articleId":"655407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655409,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

It is noted that the MMSE receiver will often lose phase lock on the desired signal when the desired signal dips into a deep fade. A modification to the MMSE receiver is presented which is demonstrated to function quite nicely in flat-fading channels. Analytical results for the modified MMSE receiver are presented and found to agree very well with simulation results. These analytical results are then compared to the theoretical performance of the conventional (i.e., correlator) receiver in terms of both bit-error rate (BER) and capacity. As expected, the modified MMSE receiver was found to offer a substantial improvement in both BER and capacity. Finally, a simple empirically derived formula is given which will give a good approximation to the BER of the modified MMSE receiver in a Rayleigh-fading environment. This formula can also be used to determine the number of users a given system can support. It is noted that as E/sub b//N/sub 0/ grows, it is quite feasible to approach 100% channel utilization with the MMSE receiver, whereas a conventional receiver is typically limited to a utilization of 10%-20%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive detection of DS/CDMA signals in fading channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.655409","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14293/00655409.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.655409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive detection of DS/CDMA signals in fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5825604","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive detection of DS/CDMA signals in fading channels","sourcePdf":"00655409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043286S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"75","articleId":"655409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655410,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, we take into consideration a low-complexity blind adaptive interference-mitigating detector (BAID) scheme that minimizes the detrimental effect of the multiple-access interference (MAI) on the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of a CDMA data demodulator. We describe a few modifications to the original algorithm that make it more suitable to a practical implementation with dual-binary phase-shift keying (D-BPSK)-modulated DS/SS signals. Specifically, we show how to make the BAID invariant to a possible carrier phase offset introduced in the front-end of the data demodulator, and we also suggest how to increase the robustness of such detector to asynchronous MAI. The uncoded BER performance of the resulting \"extended\" detector is then evaluated theoretically and by computer simulation in the case of coherent and differential signal detection.","doi":"10.1109/26.655410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14293/00655410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.655410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14293","startPage":"125","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a low-complexity adaptive interference-mitigating detector for DS/SS receivers in CDMA radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a low-complexity adaptive interference-mitigating detector for DS/SS receivers in CDMA radio networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5825605","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a low-complexity adaptive interference-mitigating detector for DS/SS receivers in CDMA radio networks","sourcePdf":"00655410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038234S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","articleId":"655410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":655412,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

However, the QS decorrelator is orthogonal to the inflated subspace spanned by the undesired users with arbitrary delays in the QS uncertainty interval and, hence, does not perform as well as a decorrelator with a priori knowledge of the delays. Here, we consider a constrained adaptive linear suppression filter which implicitly estimates the delays of the QS undesired signals, and thus approaches the ideal decorrelator of Lupas and Verdu (1990). For QS-CDMA, it is shown through analysis and simulations that the constrained recursive least-squares (C-RLS) algorithm converges faster than an unconstrained RLS adaptive filter, and generally outperforms the nonadaptive QS decorrelator. A cellular quasi-synchronous system is discussed in the present paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of constrained and unconstrained adaptive multiuser detectors for quasi-synchronous CDMA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.655412","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14293/00655412.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.655412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Performance of constrained and unconstrained adaptive multiuser detectors for quasi-synchronous CDMA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5825606","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of constrained and unconstrained adaptive multiuser detectors for quasi-synchronous CDMA","sourcePdf":"00655412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048003S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","articleId":"655412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":655413,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

The parameters of primary interest are the time delays of the signals and their spatial signatures at the array. Estimates of the signal directions of arrival are also considered but are of secondary importance in this work. Maximum likelihood algorithms and more computationally efficient approximations are developed for both the case where all received signals are identical (the channel estimation/overlapping echo problem) and where they are all distinct. Conditions are also derived under which the standard matched filter approach yields consistent and statistically efficient parameter estimates. The issue of solution uniqueness is addressed, and in particular, an upper bound on the number of signals whose parameters may be uniquely identified is derived for a number of different cases. Typically, the bound is far greater than the number of sensors and is limited only by the number of data samples collected. Some representative simulation examples are also included to illustrate the algorithms' performance relative to the Cramer-Rao bound.","doi":"10.1109/78.655429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14292/00655429.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.655429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time delay and spatial signature estimation using known asynchronous signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655429/","displayDocTitle":"Time delay and spatial signature estimation using known asynchronous signals","volume":"46","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5833884","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time delay and spatial signature estimation using known asynchronous signals","sourcePdf":"00655429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049037S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"104","articleId":"655429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655431,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

These new schemes learn the set of N Markov chain states, and the a posteriori probability of being in each of the states at each time instant. They are designed to achieve the strengths, in terms of computational effort and convergence rates, of each of the two classes of earlier proposed adaptive HMM schemes without the weaknesses of each in these areas.

We generalize the analysis of single-carrier PSAM to the 2D time-frequency lattice of OFDM. We analyze 2D-PSAM for two different channel estimators: one with good performance and high complexity and one suboptimal with low complexity. We verify that a good rule of thumb is to place the pilots at least as twice as close, in time and frequency, as required by the 2D sampling theorem.","doi":"10.1109/ICPWC.1997.655481","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

In this method, the received 16-QAM signal is processed in two paths; one path transforms the received signal into a 12-PSK signal, and the other detects the envelope of the received signal. Using an envelope detector and a window detector, we extract the time period that the 16-QAM signal causing phase jitter exists. We recover the carrier phase from the 12-PSK signal using a digital phase locked loop (PLL) which is controlled by the window detector output. By this method, the data pattern-related noise of the conventional times-four carrier recovery method is entirely eliminated. We implement an experimental model to examine the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

This method makes use of complementary code sets. These codes have been selected due to their ideal autocorrelation and noninteracting characteristics. With these code sets orthogonality between users can be maintained even in the fading multipath channel which is a valuable property that cannot be provided with conventional multiple access codes. Bit error rate simulations have been made to test the link level performance of the system. Both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels have been employed. Simulation results confirmed that complementary code sets are well adapted for use as multiple access codes in a mobile radio environment. Link level simulations pointed out that by using complementary code sets the number of non-interacting users in the Rayleigh fading channel on a single carrier can be increased. One clear advantage compared to the traditional CDMA systems is that power control is not necessary within a cell. Neither are the time synchronization requirements so strict as usual. The Erlang radio capacity was studied. The results indicated that approximately a twofold improvement over TDMA is possible with hybrid techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICPWC.1997.655554","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

However, little emphasis has been given to how one may migrate from analog to CDMA, and how the underlying analog system is impacted by the sharing of the spectrum between the two technologies. Such practical issues may reduce the realized capacity below the sum of the theoretical capacity of the individual systems. In an overlay system the objective is to increase the capacity of the total deployed system rather than that of the digital system, or analog system alone. This paper discusses some preliminary results and focuses on such issues as using the coverage advantage of CDMA over analog to decrease the required number of cell sites that require conversion to dual-mode, and how this affects the underlying analog system and the effective capacity of the total system. As more demands occur on the system, the question arises as to whether one should deploy CDMA in more analog cells in the dual-mode footprint, or opt for an additional carrier in either a portion or in the total footprint. The various options available to the network provider are analyzed with the objective of optimization of the total system capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

A comparison is made between the maximum throughputs (in bits/chip or bits/s/Hz) achievable using multiuser detection and single-user detection, for both \"single-cell\" and cellular systems. For the single-cell scenario, our results indicate that asynchronous multiuser detection systems employing long (random) spreading sequences and low rate coding, can provide considerable improvements in spectral efficiency over single-user detection systems.

First generation transducer arrays with diaphragms varying in size from 0.2 to 2 mm were tested. Second generation 8/spl times/8 arrays have also been built and tested in water in the frequency range of 0.3 to 2 MHz. Improvements to the sol-gel process have yielded high-quality, crack-free PZT films up to 12 /spl mu/m in thickness, which leads directly to higher sensitivity and figure of merit for acoustic transducers. The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient d/sub 33/ is 140 to 240 pC/N, measured through a double beam laser interferometer. Remanent polarization of 28 /spl mu/C/cm/sup 2/, a coercive field of 30 kV/cm, and dielectric constant of 1400 were measured on 4-/spl mu/m thick films.

In order to achieve the desired one-half wavelength interconnection spacing present at the backing of the transducer module, an intermediary flexible printed circuit and other custom structures provide a transitional architecture between 42 AWG coax and inline interconnect pads at a 300 /spl mu/m spacing. Due to critical alignment requirements, special processes are needed for fabrication and the successful connection of the fine-pitch circuit elements. A conductive anisotropic elastomeric material acts as the medium to effect the final interconnect between the PGA and transducer module. Because the anisotropic medium provides a separable interface, the interconnect system allows repeated connection.

In practice, however, the sidelobe level fluctuates much around this mean. In this paper two optimization methods for thinned arrays are given: one is for optimizing the weights of each element, and the other one optimizes both the layout and the weights. The weight optimization algorithm is based on linear programming and minimizes the peak sidelobe level for a given beamwidth. It is used to investigate the conditions for finding thinned arrays with peak sidelobe level at or below the inverse of the number of elements. With optimization of the weights of a randomly thinned array, it is possible to come quite close and even below this value, especially for 1D arrays. Even for 2D sparse arrays a large reduction in peak sidelobe level is achieved. Even better solutions are found when the thinning pattern is optimized also. This requires an algorithm that uses mixed integer linear programming. In this case solutions, with lower peak sidelobe level than the inverse number of elements can be found both in the 1D and the 2D cases.","doi":"10.1109/58.655623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14299/00655623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14299","startPage":"983","endPage":"991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Properties of the beampattern of weight- and layout-optimized sparse arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Properties of the beampattern of weight- and layout-optimized sparse arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5706818","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Properties of the beampattern of weight- and layout-optimized sparse arrays","sourcePdf":"00655623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065771S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"14299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"103","articleId":"655623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":655626,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

Multi-row array transducers can provide significantly improved elevation performance in return for \"modest\" increases in probe and system complexity. Time domain simulations of elevation beam profiles are used to compare several types of multi-row probes. The elevation aperture of a 1.25D probe increases with range, but the elevation focusing of that aperture is static and determined principally by a mechanical lens with a fixed focus (or foci). 1.25D probes can provide substantially better near- and far-field slice thickness performance than 1D probes and require no additional system beamformer channels. 1.5D, probes use additional beamformer channels to provide dynamic focusing and apodization in elevation. 1.5D probes can provide detail resolution comparable to, and contrast resolution substantially better than, 1.25D probes, particularly in the mid- and far-field. Further increases in system channel count allow the use of 1.75D and 2D arrays for adaptive acoustics and two-dimensional beam steering. Significant improvements in clinical image quality can be expected as multi-row probes become increasingly available in the marketplace.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elevation performance of 1.25D and 1.5D transducer arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.655628","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14299/00655628.pdf","startPage":"1027","endPage":"1037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14299","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655628/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Elevation performance of 1.25D and 1.5D transducer arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5706823","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevation performance of 1.25D and 1.5D transducer arrays","sourcePdf":"00655628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038916S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"14299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"75","articleId":"655628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":655629,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Selection of an appropriate material for a transducer is based on many factors, including material properties, transducer area, and operating frequency. The properties of a number of piezoceramic materials have been experimentally determined by measuring the electrical impedance of air-loaded resonators whose thickness corresponds to resonance frequencies from 10 to 100 MHz. Materials measured include commercially available compositions of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with relatively high dielectric constants and a modified lead titanate (PT) composition with a much lower dielectric constant. In addition, materials which have been designed or modified to result in improved properties at high frequencies are studied. Conclusions concerning the influence of the microstructure and composition on the frequency dependence of the material properties are made from the calculated properties and microstructural analysis of each material. Issues which affect transducer performance are discussed in relation to the properties. For transducers larger than about 1 mm in diameter, the use of a lower dielectric constant material is shown to result in a better electrical match between the transducer and a standard 50 /spl Omega/ termination. For transducers whose impedance is close to that of the connecting cables and electrical termination, equivalent circuit model simulations show improved performance without the need for electrical matching networks. Measurements of fabricated transducers show close agreement with the simulations, validating the measurements and showing the performance benefits of electrically matched transducers.","doi":"10.1109/58.655629","startPage":"1038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14299/00655629.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655629","endPage":"1048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piezoceramics for high-frequency (20 to 100 MHz) single-element imaging transducers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Piezoceramics for high-frequency (20 to 100 MHz) single-element imaging transducers","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5706824","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piezoceramics for high-frequency (20 to 100 MHz) single-element imaging transducers","sourcePdf":"00655629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038798S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"14299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"82","articleId":"655629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655630,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

The dielectric properties of nylon films were measured over a broadband frequency range including the fundamental halfwave resonance frequency for each sample, and a curve-fitting resonance technique was used to determine the properties of interest for ultrasound transducer design. Despite the high remanent polarization measured in the nylon films (1.25 mC/cm/sup 2/), the measured electromechanical coupling constant (k/sub t/=0.11), and mechanical quality factor (Q/sub m/=8) were lower than typically seen for PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer. Poor thickness uniformity of the nylon film samples is suspected of dampening the features of the dielectric spectra near resonance, resulting in lower measured values for k/sub t/ and Q/sub m/. Comparisons of both simulated and actual measured pulse-echo performance showed the nylon materials to be competitive with PVDF for ultrasonic transducer performance. Actual pulse-echo tests with nylon-7 yielded a -6 dB fractional bandwidth of 144%. Since the ferroelectric nylons are known to be hydrophilic, tests were conducted to quantitatively determine the effects of water absorption on the ultrasonic performance of nylon-7 transducers.

In the present work, broadband, high power tonpilz transducers have been designed using the finite element (FE) method. Optimized vibrational modes including the flapping mode of the head are effectively used to achieve the broadband performance. The behavior of the transducer in its longitudinal piston mode and in its flapping mode is analysed for in-air and in-water situations. For the 37.8% bandwidth of the center frequency from 28.5 to 41.8 kHz, the amplitude variation of the transmitting voltage response (TVR) does not exceed /spl plusmn/2 dB and a maximum TVR of 146.8 dB (ref. 1 /spl mu/Pa/volt at 1 meter) is obtained. Reasonable agreement between the experimental results and the numerical results is achieved. A maximum sound pressure level of 214.8 dB can be expected. Further numerical calculation indicates that there is potential for increasing the bandwidth by varying other parameters in the design.","doi":"10.1109/58.655631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655631","endPage":"1066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14299/00655631.pdf","startPage":"1060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband tonpilz underwater acoustic transducers based on multimode optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655631/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband tonpilz underwater acoustic transducers based on multimode optimization","volume":"44","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5706826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband tonpilz underwater acoustic transducers based on multimode optimization","sourcePdf":"00655631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030602S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"14299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"34","articleId":"655631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":655635,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

Consequently, there is interest in developing sparse 2D transducer arrays. In this paper, we present the results of a study looking at the broad-bandwidth radiation patterns of 72 different sparse 2D vernier arrays. Suppression of grating lobes is achieved by choosing a different arrangement of transmit and receive elements using an analogy with a vernier scale. The broad-bandwidth radiation patterns were investigated by simulating volumetric sector scan of a point target. We summarize these results by deriving a set of design curves that predicts the minimum number of elements, element spacing, and apodization required for a desired beam width and maximum secondary lobe. The results show that a sparse vernier array can be designed with significantly lower average and peak secondary lobes compared with a sparse random array with the same number of elements and aperture size.","doi":"10.1109/58.655635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.655635","endPage":"1109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14299/00655635.pdf","startPage":"1101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broad-bandwidth radiation patterns of sparse two-dimensional vernier arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655635/","displayDocTitle":"Broad-bandwidth radiation patterns of sparse two-dimensional vernier arrays","volume":"44","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5706830","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broad-bandwidth radiation patterns of sparse two-dimensional vernier arrays","sourcePdf":"00655635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055383S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"14299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"71","articleId":"655635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655646,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The technique is founded on the physics of the image-formation process. Beamforming, a method widely applied in acoustic imaging, is used to build a range image from backscattered echoes, associated point by point with another type of information representing the reliability (or confidence) of such an image. Unfortunately, this kind of images is plagued by problems due to the nature of the signal and to the related sensing system. In the proposed algorithm, the range and confidence images are modeled as Markov random fields whose associated probability distributions are specified by a single energy function. This function has been designed to fully embed the physics of the acoustic image-formation process by modeling a priori knowledge of the acoustic system, the considered scene, and the noise-affecting measures and also by integrating reliability information to allow the coupled and simultaneous reconstruction and restoration of both images. Optimal (in the maximum a posteriori probability sense) estimates of the reconstructed range image map and the restored confidence image are obtained by minimizing the energy function using simulated annealing. Experimental results show the improvement of the processed images over those obtained by other methods performing separate reconstruction and restoration processes that disregard reliability information.","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/14286/00655646.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.655646","doi":"10.1109/34.655646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655646","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image restoration","Physics","Underwater acoustics","Array signal processing","Acoustic imaging","Markov random fields","Probability distribution","Layout","Acoustic noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","probability","image restoration","Markov processes","simulated annealing","speckle","minimisation","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic approach","underwater acoustic images","image-formation process","beamforming","backscattered echoes","confidence images","range images","Markov random fields","probability distributions","noise-affecting measures","reliability information","maximum a posteriori probability","confidence image","energy function","simulated annealing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic approach to the coupled reconstruction and restoration of underwater acoustic images","accessionNumber":"5852587","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic approach to the coupled reconstruction and restoration of underwater acoustic images","sourcePdf":"00655646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058069S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"37","articleId":"655646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655647,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We present a straightforward procedure for aligning positive face examples for training. To collect negative examples, we use a bootstrap algorithm, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting nonface training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of nonface images. Simple heuristics, such as using the fact that faces rarely overlap in images, can further improve the accuracy. Comparisons with several other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented, showing that our system has comparable performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates.","doi":"10.1109/34.655647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.655647","startPage":"23","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/14286/00655647.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based face detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based face detection","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5852588","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based face detection","sourcePdf":"00655647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065148S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"2122","articleId":"655647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":655648,"authors":[{"name":"K.-K.

Efficient parsing algorithms for answering particular queries about a PCFG (i.e., calculating the probability of a given sentence, or finding the most likely parse) have been developed and applied to a variety of pattern-recognition problems. We extend the class of queries that can be answered in several ways: (1) allowing missing tokens in a sentence or sentence fragment, (2) supporting queries about intermediate structure, such as the presence of particular nonterminals, and (3) flexible conditioning on a variety of types of evidence. Our method works by constructing a Bayesian network to represent the distribution of parse trees induced by a given PCFG. The network structure mirrors that of the chart in a standard parser, and is generated using a similar dynamic programming approach. We present an algorithm for constructing Bayesian networks from PCFGs, and show how queries or patterns of queries on the network correspond to interesting queries on PCFGs. The network formalism also supports extensions to encode various context sensitivities within the probabilistic dependency structure.","doi":"10.1109/34.655650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.655650","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/14286/00655650.pdf","startPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized queries on probabilistic context-free grammars","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655650/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized queries on probabilistic context-free grammars","volume":"20","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5852590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized queries on probabilistic context-free grammars","sourcePdf":"00655650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046904S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"27","articleId":"655650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":655652,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Injury from electrical hazards affects working adults in a majority of the reported cases. Electrical arcs occur frequently in the electrical trauma setting, reportedly in as many as 75% of accidents. It is nearly impossible to precisely determine the tissue exposure to current in most cases. Reports have been unable to identify relationships between exposure parameters in electrical trauma and clinical outcome. If such a relationship exists, its knowledge would be of great value to treating physicians, therapists and safety engineers. In this article, the thermoacoustic wave effects or \"blast explosion\" from arcs are reviewed. The authors estimate the magnitude of pressure that would be created as a result of the thermal acoustic energy released from hypothetical electrical arc events. The published thresholds for injury from blast are presented. Finally, the relationships between how an electrical accident occurs, the exposures at the accident scene and the potential for injuries are addressed.","doi":"10.1109/2943.655657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/2943/14297/00655657.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"31,41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2943.655657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation between electrical accident parameters and injury","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655657/","displayDocTitle":"Correlation between electrical accident parameters and injury","volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 1998","accessionNumber":"5857954","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation between electrical accident parameters and injury","sourcePdf":"00655657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035444S","chronDate":"March-April  1998","isNumber":"14297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"19","articleId":"655657","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":655660,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We propose a general class of allocation methods, referred to as cyclic allocation methods, and show that many existing methods are instances of this class. As a result, various seemingly ad hoc and unrelated methods are presented in a single framework. Furthermore, the framework is used to develop new allocation methods that give better performance than any previous method and that approach the best feasible performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14296","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/5268/14296/00655763.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.1998.655763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.1998.655763","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic allocation of two-dimensional data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655763/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic allocation of two-dimensional data","conferenceDate":"23-27 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5856737","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic allocation of two-dimensional data","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00655763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037159S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5268","citationCount":"40","articleId":"655763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":655778,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Kee Yi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Byoung-Kee Yi","id":"37436746800"},{"name":"H.V.

However, for several applications, including matching of voice, audio and medical signals (e.g., electrocardiograms), one is required to permit local accelerations and decelerations in the rate of sequences, leading to a popular, field tested dissimilarity metric called the \"time warping\" distance. From the indexing viewpoint, this metric presents two major challenges: (a) it does not lead to any natural indexable \"features\", and (b) comparing two sequences requires time quadratic in the sequence length. To address each problem, we propose to use: (a) a modification of the so called \"FastMap\", to map sequences into points, with little compromise of \"recall\" (typically zero); and (b) a fast linear test, to help us discard quickly many of the false alarms that FastMap will typically introduce. Using both ideas in cascade, our proposed method achieved up to an order of magnitude speed-up over sequential scanning on both real and synthetic datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655778/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5856752","conferenceDate":"23-27 Feb. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient retrieval of similar time sequences under time warping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient retrieval of similar time sequences under time warping","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00655778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032751S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5268","citationCount":"78","articleId":"655778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655786,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Blocks of a video movie are be distributed and replicated over multiple video servers. Customers are served by one video server. This video server, termed the originating server, might have to interact with other servers for downloading missing blocks of the requested movie. We present three types of presentation plans that an originating server can possibly construct for satisfying a customer's request. A presentation plan can be considered as a detailed (temporally synchronized) sequence of steps carried out by the originating server for presenting the requested movie to the customer. The creation of presentation plans involves obtaining commitments from other video servers and the network service provider, as well as making local resource commitments, within the limitations of available bandwidth, available buffer and customer consumption rates. For evaluating the goodness of a presentation plan, we introduce two measures of optimality for presentation plans: minimizing the waiting time for a customer and minimizing the access bandwidth. We present algorithms for computing optimal presentation plans and compare their performance experimentally. We have also mathematically proved certain results for the presentation plans.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.1998.655786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.1998.655786","endPage":"275","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/5268/14296/00655786.pdf","startPage":"268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed video presentations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655786/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed video presentations","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5856760","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed video presentations","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00655786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030448S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5268","citationCount":"4","articleId":"655786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":655804,"authors":[{"name":"B.

For example, if we compute association rules over monthly sales data, we may observe seasonal variation where certain rules are true at approximately the same month each year. Similarly, association rules can also display regular hourly, daily, weekly, etc., variation that is cyclical in nature. We demonstrate that existing methods cannot be naively extended to solve this problem of cyclic association rules. We then present two new algorithms for discovering such rules. The first one, which we call the sequential algorithm, treats association rules and cycles more or less independently. By studying the interaction between association rules and time, we devise a new technique called cycle pruning, which reduces the amount of time needed to find cyclic association rules. The second algorithm, which we call the interleaved algorithm, uses cycle pruning and other optimization techniques for discovering cyclic association rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the interleaved algorithm through a series of experiments. These experiments show that the interleaved algorithm can yield significant performance benefits when compared to the sequential algorithm. Performance improvements range from 5% to several hundred percent.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.1998.655804","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/5268/14296/00655804.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.1998.655804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14296","startPage":"412","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic association rules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic association rules","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655804/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5850658","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic association rules","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00655804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039151S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5268","citationCount":"172","articleId":"655804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655819,"authors":[{"name":"C.

To do so, communication synthesis derives a communication topology to determine which components are to be connected to a common communication channel in the final hardware implementation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to cluster processes to share a communication channel. An iterative graph-based clustering algorithm is driven by a heterogeneous cost function which takes into account bit widths, the probability of access collisions on the channels, cost for arbitration logic as well as the availability of interface resources on the hardware components to trade-off cost against performance in a most optimum fashion. The key aspects of the approach are demonstrated on a small example.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","pdfPath":"/iel4/5270/14300/00655834.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","doi":"10.1109/DATE.1998.655834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.1998.655834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14300","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of interconnect topologies for communication synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Hardware","Cost function","Communication channels","Communication system software","Digital systems","Clustering algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Logic","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","network topology","integrated circuit layout","graph theory","circuit optimisation","iterative methods","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnect topologies generation","communication synthesis","hardware/software codesign","communication topology","communication channel","iterative graph-based clustering algorithm","heterogeneous cost function","bit widths","access collisions probability","arbitration logic cost","interface resources availability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Generation of interconnect topologies for communication synthesis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5912337","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of interconnect topologies for communication synthesis","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00655834.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046213S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5270","citationCount":"11","articleId":"655834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":655840,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Lossless compression is usually required in the medical image field. The word length required for lossless compression makes too expensive the area cost of the architectures that appear in the literature. Thus, there is a clear need for designing an architecture to implement the lossless compression of medical images using DWT. The datapath word-length has been selected to ensure the lossless accuracy criteria leading a high speed implementation with small chip area. The result is a pipelined architecture that supports single chip implementation in VLSI technology.

Therefore they are realized using fixed-point architectures, either dedicated HW or programmable DSPs. On the other hand, system design starts from a floating-point description. These requirements have been the motivation for FRIDGE, a design environment for the specification, evaluation and implementation of fixed-point systems. FRIDGE offers a seamless design flow from a floating-point description to a fixed point implementation. Within this paper we focus on two core capabilities of FRIDGE: (1) the concept of an interactive, automated transformation of floating-point programs written in ANSI-C into fixed-point specifications, based on an interpolative approach. The design time reductions that can be achieved make FRIDGE a key component for an efficient HW/SW-codesign; (2) a fast fixed-point simulation that performs comprehensive compile-time analyses, reducing simulation time by one order of magnitude compared to existing approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FRIDGE: a fixed-point design and simulation environment","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","doi":"10.1109/DATE.1998.655893","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","pdfPath":"/iel4/5270/14300/00655893.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.1998.655893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14300","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"FRIDGE: a fixed-point design and simulation environment","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5906836","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FRIDGE: a fixed-point design and simulation environment","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00655893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057829S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5270","citationCount":"63","articleId":"655893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":655896,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By interconnect tuning, we refer to the selection of line thicknesses, widths and spacings in multi-layer interconnect to simultaneously optimize signal distribution, signal performance, signal integrity, and interconnect manufacturability and reliability. This is a key activity in most leading-edge design projects, but has received little attention in the literature. Our work provides the first technology-specific studies of interconnect tuning in the literature. We center on global wiring layers and interconnect tuning issues related to bus routing, repeater insertion, and choice of shielding/spacing rules for signal integrity and performance. We address four basic questions. (1) How should width and spacing be allocated to maximize performance for a given line pitch? (2) For a given line pitch, what criteria affect the optimal interval at which repeaters should be inserted into global interconnects? (3) Under what circumstances are shield wires the optimum technique for improving interconnect performance? (4) In global interconnect with repeaters, what other interconnect tuning is possible? Our study of question (4) demonstrates a new approach of offsetting repeater placements that can reduce worst-case cross-chip delays by over 30% in current technologies.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.1998.655900","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","pdfPath":"/iel4/5270/14300/00655900.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.1998.655900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14300","startPage":"471","endPage":"478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnect tuning strategies for high-performance ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interconnect tuning strategies for high-performance ICs","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655900/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5906842","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnect tuning strategies for high-performance ICs","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00655900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064317S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5270","citationCount":"61","articleId":"655900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":655905,"authors":[{"name":"A.J. van de Goor","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and Systems Section Computer Architecture & Digital Technique, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"A.J.","lastName":"van de Goor","id":"37273366000"},{"name":"I.B.S.

Traditionally, word-oriented memories have been tested by repeated application of a test for bit-oriented memories whereby a different data background (which depends on the used intra-word fault model) is used during each iteration. This results in rime inefficiencies and limited fault coverage. A new approach for testing word-oriented memories is presented, distinguishing between inter-word and intra-word faults and allowing for a systematic way of converting tests for bit-oriented memories to rests for word-oriented memories. The conversion consists of concatenating the bit-oriented test for inter-word faults with a test for intra-word faults. This approach results in more efficient tests with complete coverage of the targeted faults. Because most memories have an external data path which is wider than one bit, word-oriented memory tests are very important.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.1998.655905","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","pdfPath":"/iel4/5270/14300/00655905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.1998.655905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14300","startPage":"501","endPage":"508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"March tests for word-oriented memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=655905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"March tests for word-oriented memories","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655905/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5912376","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"March tests for word-oriented memories","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00655905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035928S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5270","citationCount":"63","articleId":"655905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655914,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

The signature /spl sigma//sub 0/ is defined by a reference circuit /spl eta//sub 0/, which itself is modeled as a canonical form of a directed bipartite graph. A wiring perturbation /spl gamma/ induces a perturbed reference circuit /spl eta//sub /spl gamma//. A number of mutant circuits /spl eta//sub /spl gamma/i/ can be resynthesized from the perturbed circuit /spl eta//sub /spl gamma//. The mutants of interest are the ones that belong to the wiring-signature-invariant equivalence class N/sub /spl sigma/0/, i.e. the mutants /spl eta//sub /spl gamma/i//spl isin/N/sub /spl sigma/0/. Circuit mutants /spl eta//sub /spl gamma/i//spl isin/N/sub /spl sigma/0/ have a number of useful properties. For any wiring perturbation /spl gamma/, the size of the wiring-signature-invariant equivalence class is huge. Notably, circuits in this class are not random, although for unbiased testing and benchmarking purposes, mutant selections from this class are typically random. For each reference circuit, we synthesized eight equivalence subclasses of circuit mutants, based on 0 to 100% perturbation. Each subclass contains 100 randomly chosen mutant circuits, each listed in a different random order. The 14,400 benchmarking experiments with 3200 mutants in 4 equivalence classes, covering 13 typical EDA algorithms, demonstrate that an unbiased random selection of such circuits can lead to statistically meaningful differentiation and improvements of existing and new algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655928/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5906867","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of wiring signature-invariant equivalence class circuit mutants and applications to benchmarking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of wiring signature-invariant equivalence class circuit mutants and applications to benchmarking","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00655928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052227S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5270","citationCount":"11","articleId":"655928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":655932,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["Center for Low Power Electronics ECE Department, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Qi Wang","id":"37087145964"},{"name":"S.B.K.

We show that the power reducing transformations result in a circuit that is a valid replacement of the original. The notion of validity used here is that of a delay safe replacement. The potential transformations are found by direct logic implications applied to the circuit netlist.

Many applications need speed of a hardware encryption implementation while trying to preserve flexibility and low cost of a software implementation. In this paper we have presented one solution of this problem. Our system architecture uses a single core module named Round to implement the IDEA algorithm. Using the core we were able to implement and test an example application in only three days. This \"off the shelf\" solution for designing a cryptographic application using the IDEA algorithm significantly reduced the design cycle, thus greatly reducing time-to-marker and cost of such designs. By increasing the number of the Round modules, a system designer can linearly increase the speed of the design. This system design methodology makes it possible to achieve the necessary performance, or to preserve area (and reduce costs) when needed unlike other known approaches. We have implemented one Round UNICORN architecture in Xilinx FPGA. After implementation the chip has been tested using the standard test vectors and it was capable of performing 2.8 Mbps encryption in both ECB and CBC mode.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14300","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe","pdfPath":"/iel4/5270/14300/00655971.pdf","doi":"10.1109/DATE.1998.655971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.1998.655971","startPage":"923","endPage":"924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal strong encryption FPGA core implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/655971/","displayDocTitle":"Universal strong encryption FPGA core implementation","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5912378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal strong encryption FPGA core implementation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00655971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031535S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5270","citationCount":"5","articleId":"655971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":655979,"authors":[{"name":"H.-G.

It achieves mobile computing without requiring the user to carry any hardware. VNC provides access to home computing environments from anywhere in the world, on whatever computing infrastructure happens to be available-including, for example, public Web browsing terminals in airports. In addition, VNC allows a single desktop to be accessed from several places simultaneously, thus supporting application sharing in the style of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). The technology underlying VNC is a simple remote display protocol. It is the simplicity of this protocol that makes VNC so powerful. Unlike other remote display protocols such as the X Window System and Citrix's ICA, the VNC protocol is totally independent of operating system, windowing system, and applications. The VNC system is freely available for download from the ORL Web site at http://www.orl.co.uk/vnc/. We begin the article by summarizing the evolution of VNC from our work on thin client architectures.

Thus, there is a critical need for fault tolerance and reconfiguration techniques for FPGAs to increase chip yields (with factory reconfiguration) and/or system reliability (with field reconfiguration). We first propose techniques utilizing the principle of node-covering to tolerate logic or cell faults in SRAM-based FPGAs. A routing discipline is developed that allows each cell to cover-to be able to replace-its neighbor in a row. Techniques are also proposed for tolerating wiring faults by means of replacement with spare portions. The replaceable portions can be individual segments, or else sets of segments, called \"grids\". Fault detection in the FPGAs is accomplished by separate testing, either at the factory or by the user. If reconfiguration around faulty cells and wiring is performed at the factory (with laser-burned fuses, for example), it is completely transparent to the user. In other words, user configuration data loaded into the SRAM remains the same, independent of whether the chip is detect-free or whether it has been reconfigured around defective cells or wiring-a major advantage for hardware vendors who design and sell FPGA-based logic (e.g., glue logic in microcontrollers, video cards, DSP cards) in production-scale quantities. Compared to other techniques for fault tolerance in FPGAs, our methods are shown to provide significantly greater yield improvement, and a 35 percent non-FT chip yield for a 16/spl times/16 FPGA is more than doubled.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodologies for tolerating cell and interconnect faults in FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/12.656073","startPage":"15","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.656073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/12/14275/00656073.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=656073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Methodologies for tolerating cell and interconnect faults in FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5859402","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodologies for tolerating cell and interconnect faults in FPGAs","sourcePdf":"00656073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032343S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"70","articleId":"656073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":656080,"authors":[{"name":"Seungjae Han","affiliation":["Real-Time Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Seungjae Han","id":"37366187500"},{"name":"K.G.

The necessity to do preventive maintenance, not only in general purpose software systems of mass use, but also in safety-critical and highly available systems, clearly indicates the need to follow an analysis based approach to determine the optimal times to perform preventive maintenance. In this paper, we present an analytical model of a software system which serves transactions. Due to aging, not only the service rate of the software decreases with time, but also the software itself experiences crash/hang failures which result in its unavailability. Two policies for preventive maintenance are modeled and expressions for resulting steady state availability, probability that an arriving transaction is lost and an upper bound on the expected response time of a transition are derived. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the models.","doi":"10.1109/12.656092","startPage":"96","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.656092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/12/14275/00656092.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of preventive maintenance in transactions based software systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656092/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of preventive maintenance in transactions based software systems","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5859405","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of preventive maintenance in transactions based software systems","sourcePdf":"00656092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029656S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"159","articleId":"656092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":656095,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In later years, the concepts of spatial diversity have been expanded to build foundations for emerging technologies, such as smart (adaptive) antennas and position location systems. Smart antennas hold great promise for increasing the capacity of wireless communications because they radiate and receive energy only in the intended directions, thereby greatly reducing interference. To properly design, analyze, and implement smart antennas and to exploit spatial processing in emerging wireless systems, accurate radio channel models that incorporate spatial characteristics are necessary.

Theoretical, computer simulation, experimental, and field trial results are also discussed that demonstrate the potential of this technology.","doi":"10.1109/98.656155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/14308/00656155.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.656155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart antennas for wireless systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Smart antennas for wireless systems","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5871817","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart antennas for wireless systems","sourcePdf":"00656155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102042S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"478","articleId":"656155","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":656157,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It can be a typical tool for realizing a software radio. An adaptive antenna array can be considered an adaptive filter in the space and time domains for radio communications, so communication theory can be generalized from a conventional time domain into both space and time domains. This article introduces a spatial and temporal communication theory based on an adaptive antenna array, such as spatial and temporal channel modeling, equalization, optimum detection for single-user and multi-user CDMA, precoding in a transmitter, and joint optimization of both transmitter and receiver. Such spatial and temporal processing promises significant improvement of performance against multipath fading in mobile radio communications.","doi":"10.1109/98.656157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/14308/00656157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.656157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14308","startPage":"28","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial and temporal communication theory using adaptive antenna array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=656157","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial and temporal communication theory using adaptive antenna array","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5871818","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial and temporal communication theory using adaptive antenna array","sourcePdf":"00656157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054628S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"152","articleId":"656157","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":656159,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Event identification plays a key role as it affects the whole detector efficiency. Identification quality depends on the goodness of event model. The main difficulty in real photon counting applications is to define a precise event model due to the high number of noise sources that make event shape far from the expected ideal model. This results in an intrinsic difficulty in development of efficient neural network training based on conventional gradient search techniques. In this paper we approach the learning problem with real data by using genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms seem to provide a rapid convergence to good solutions even using limited computational resources.

Because the cut-off regions of high efficient power amplifiers were removed it is believed that the linearity of this kind of amplifier is improved for certain types of modulation techniques which are sensitive to the nonlinearities of the cut-off regions. For heat dissipation a clip-chip technique is used as a heat sink in a coplanar environment.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1997.656419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.1997.656419","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1112 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel4/5255/14314/00656419.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A L-band high efficient power amplifier in CPW techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A L-band high efficient power amplifier in CPW techniques","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"6039588","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656419/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A L-band high efficient power amplifier in CPW techniques","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00656419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028191S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5255","citationCount":"1","articleId":"656419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":656421,"authors":[{"name":"Naiqian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Naiqian Zhang","id":"37087162996"},{"name":"Yu-On Yam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yu-On Yam","id":"37087593079"},{"name":"Baoxin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Baoxin Gao","id":"37087303509"},{"name":"Chi-Wai Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chi-Wai Cheung","id":"37087592384"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"962-442-117-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"656421","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=656421","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","High power amplifiers","Switches","Coaxial components","Circuits","Inductors","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic induction","Coils","Spirals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF power amplifiers","switching circuits","inductors","time-domain analysis","equivalent circuits","network synthesis","network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class E power amplifier","coaxial line components","coaxial line inductors","lumped-distributed circuit simulation","time-domain method","power loss calculation","collector efficiency","time-domain switch resistor model","transient resistance","I-V characteristics"]}],"abstract":"At high efficiency, an inductor's electromagnetic emission will cause power loss and circuit instability.

The LOCISS is a local sensing device for collision avoidance by which robots can detect other robots and obstacles and discriminate them by exchanging relevant information. We (1996) reported previously a collision avoidance method between two robots based on the predetermined rules using LOCISS. It is, however, difficult to realize collision avoidance among three or more robots by the predetermined rules only because situations around the robots become more complicated as the number of robots increases. Thus, it is desirable for the robots to have an adaptive capability for acquisition of the behaviors to avoid collision with other robots and obstacles. To acquire the adaptive behavior, the reinforcement learning is introduced in this paper. It is shown that appropriate behaviors for collision avoidance can be successfully acquired through the proposed learning process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656599/","accessionNumber":"5856165","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-11 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive behavior acquisition of collision avoidance among multiple autonomous mobile robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive behavior acquisition of collision avoidance among multiple autonomous mobile robots","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"00656599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041242S","chronDate":"7-11 Sep 1997","isNumber":"14245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5229","citationCount":"12","articleId":"656599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":656622,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Unfortunately, the tiny array elements in a 2-D array have poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We have previously shown that SNR is increased in 2-D array transducers made from piezoelectric multilayer ceramics. Conventional one-dimensional models provide accurate results when comparing multilayer ceramic performance relative to single layer transducers. However, these models are not accurate when comparing simulations directly to measurements. Because multilayer ceramics have a complex structure, a 3-D model, such as finite element analysis, is needed for accurate simulations. We modeled four arrays that were previously fabricated: a single layer and multilayer 1 MHz, 2-D array element, and a single layer and multilayer 2.25 MHz, 1.5-D array element that can focus and steer in azimuth but only steer in the elevation dimension. We compared the simulated and measured impedance plots for each transducer. The finite element analysis plots accurately predicted the impedance for each vibration mode. On the other hand, the one dimensional KLM transmission line model could simulate only the thickness mode vibrations and the results were inaccurate compared to measurements. We also simulated the transmit output pressure for the 2.25 MHz arrays and compared the results to measurements. The simulated pressure vs. time plots and their spectra were accurate when compared to measurements. Finally, we obtained a series of images that show the impulse response vibrations for the 2.25 MHz, arrays. These animations show the vibration modes in the complex multilayer ceramic structure. Measurements were not available to confirm the animations. Our results show that finite element analysis in three dimensions is a valuable tool to predict the performance of multi-layer transducers.","doi":"10.1109/58.656622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.656622","endPage":"1214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14310/00656622.pdf","startPage":"1204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of piezoelectric multilayer ceramics using finite element analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656622/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of piezoelectric multilayer ceramics using finite element analysis","volume":"44","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5784162","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of piezoelectric multilayer ceramics using finite element analysis","sourcePdf":"00656622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039874S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"14310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"30","articleId":"656622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":656634,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

Possible applications include dermatology, ophthalmology, pathology, and tissue engineering. In addition, if the resolution approaches cellular dimensions, then this system may be very useful in understanding tissue micromorphology. Elasticity images can be reconstructed from displacement and strain fields measured throughout the specimen during controlled external loading. High frequency ultrasound is used to obtain these images by tracking coherent speckle motion during deformation. In this paper, methods are presented to track speckle in two dimensions with near unity correlation coefficients using a high frequency, single element focused transducer. These techniques include improved means for speckle tracking. Procedures to control boundary conditions for consistent specimen deformation and scanning techniques required to obtain a plane-strain state in the imaging plane are also discussed. To test these methods, a 50 MHz elasticity microscope was constructed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.656634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14310","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1319","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14310/00656634.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An elasticity microscope.

In this paper, a new extended autocorrelation method (EAM) that uses both phase and magnitude of the two dimensional (depth and temporal direction) autocorrelation function for estimating the blood velocity is presented. It is shown that the EAM has similar performance as the cross-correlation method (CCM). Both of them have smaller estimation variance than the AM and have the ability to estimate velocities beyond the Nyquist velocity, but the EAM is more computationally efficient than the CCM. A 2-D blood flow signal with rectilinear velocity including the transit time effect has also been simulated and the results are presented in this paper. For comparison, the EAM and the CCM have been applied to the simulated signals in which the flow velocities are up to four times the Nyquist velocity. The EAM has been further verified by experimental RF data from the subclavian artery.","doi":"10.1109/58.656636","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14310/00656636.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.656636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An extended autocorrelation method for estimation of blood velocity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=656636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"An extended autocorrelation method for estimation of blood velocity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/656636/","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5784175","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An extended autocorrelation method for estimation of blood velocity","sourcePdf":"00656636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059374S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"14310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"45","articleId":"656636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":656639,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

This paper compares two modes in which the electrodes of a tripolar nerve cuff may be connected to amplifier components. The authors recorded evoked sensory activity from the sciatic nerve in an anesthetized rabbit while mechanical stimulation was applied to the central toe pad. A commercial transformer coupled amplifier and a custom amplifier that uses AMPO1 integrated circuit components were compared when each amplifier was configured in a 'quasi-tripolar' verses true tripolar configuration. Results showed that the true tripolar configuration had superior signal to noise ratio in both amplifiers. Furthermore, an excellent performance was demonstrated for the AMPO1 based amplifier without transformer coupling, suggesting that amplifiers designed for implantation (which precludes using bulky transformers) need not compromise the quality of the neural recordings.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1996.657000","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 18th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 18th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel4/5216/14228/00657000.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"376 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1996.657000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of alternative amplifier configurations for tripolar nerve cuff recorded ENG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-3 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Performance of alternative amplifier configurations for tripolar nerve cuff recorded ENG","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5876589","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/657000/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of alternative amplifier configurations for tripolar nerve cuff recorded ENG","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00657000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040254S","chronDate":"31 Oct-3 Nov 1996","isNumber":"14228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5216","citationCount":"27","articleId":"657000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":657040,"authors":[{"name":"Gwo-Ching Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan","National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Gwo-Ching Chang","id":"37087516927"},{"name":"Gon-Der Liao","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Gon-Der Liao","id":"37087551558"},{"name":"Jer-Junn Luh","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Jer-Junn Luh","id":"37087248078"},{"name":"Jin-Shin Lai","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Jin-Shin Lai","id":"37087144918"},{"name":"Cheng-Kung Cheng","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Cheng-Kung Cheng","id":"37087516331"},{"name":"Te-Son Kuo","lastName":"Te-Son Kuo","id":"37087146327"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3811-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"657040","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=657040","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Control systems","Knee","Three-term control","Muscles","Adaptive control","Feedforward neural networks","Inverse problems","Leg","Position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurocontrollers","biocontrol","position control","muscle","orthotics","biomechanics","bioelectric phenomena","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network-based controller","knee-joint position control","quadriceps stimulation","neuro-control system","desired movement trajectory","inverse model","quadriceps-lower leg system","directly feedforward control","knee joint angle","neuro-PID controller","functional electrical stimulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1996.657040","pdfPath":"/iel4/5216/14228/00657040.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 18th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 18th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","startPage":"455","endPage":"456 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1996.657040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural network-based controller for the knee-joint position control with quadriceps stimulation","abstract":"A neuro-control system has been designed to control the knee joint to move in accordance with the desired trajectory of movement with stimulation of quadriceps muscle.

Feedforward compensation is used to eliminate steady tracking errors which are caused by the nonlinear term.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.657100","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14225/00657100.pdf","startPage":"2211","endPage":"2212 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.657100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of nonlinear non-minimum phase systems using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/657100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of nonlinear non-minimum phase systems using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5863735","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of nonlinear non-minimum phase systems using neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00657100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030772S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","citationCount":"1","articleId":"657100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":657178,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The challenge of 1550-nm transmission is that the standard non-dispersion-shifted fiber, which is widely deployed by the CATV industry, has significant chromatic dispersion. Optical amplifiers boost the power but add noise, thereby degrading the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the transmitted signal. The technology, design, and perfdrmance of 1550-nm analog CATV systems are presented.","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1998.657228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1998.657228","startPage":"85","endPage":"86","displayPublicationTitle":"OFC '98.

Summary form only given. Optical storage buffers are expected to be an important component in high-speed time-division multiplexed (TDM) optical networks. Storage loops capable of up to 80 GHz bit rates have been demonstrated; however, these require either direct amplitude modulation or indirect optical modulation via cross-gain saturation to maintain the bit timing. Such devices have made use of Er-doped fiber amplifiers to compensate for the linear loss and require filtering to suppress the amplified spontaneous emission noise. We have recently demonstrated all-optical storage of a picosecond-pulse packet in a fiber buffer that made use of a fiber-optic phase-sensitive parametric amplifier (PSA) to overcome the loss. Recently, the use of PSAs for amplitude noise suppression and, with independent phase-locked sources, for in-line amplification has been demonstrated. In this paper we present further results pertaining to our demonstration of the use of a PSA in a fiber buffer that can store picosecond-pulse packets of ones and zeros. In particular, we present data showing single-shot loading of the injected packet.","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1998.657334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1998.657334","publicationTitle":"OFC '98.

Summary form only given. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise is a major limit to the performance of modern day optical transmission systems. A way to alleviate system impairments due to ASE is the insertion of bandpass filters along the line. Soliton pulses have shown excellent stability to in-line narrow-band filtering, and also to sliding of the filter center frequency along the line. The dynamics of soliton signals in the presence of both fixed and sliding filters has been the subject of detailed studies. However, little attention has been given to the dynamics of the ASE growth in the presence of in-line filters. The analysis of the ASE noise growth in a chain of N amplifiers in the presence of in-line filters is the subject of this work. This analysis has been extended to the case of semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA), where the noise growth, combined with the fast saturation of the amplifier gain, are more effective in degrading system performance. The analytical results have been compared with numerical simulations. Good agreement has been obtained for in-line erbium amplifiers, also considering a high inversion factor. For SOAs, on the other hand, the more complex amplifier dynamics makes the theory quantitatively less accurate, as expected. Even in this case, however, the analytical formulas can be taken as useful guidelines for the design of optical systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/657335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6016109","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical evaluation of the noise growth and of the system performance for a link constituted by a chain of N optical amplifiers with in-line filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical evaluation of the noise growth and of the system performance for a link constituted by a chain of N optical amplifiers with in-line filters","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00657335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042732S","chronDate":"22-27 Feb. 1998","isNumber":"14321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5284","citationCount":"3","articleId":"657335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":657343,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In optical systems having relatively low bit-rate/spl times/distance products (e.g., 2.5 Gbit/s/spl times/100 km) the major problem is to have sufficient power budgets and optical signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). With the increase of the distance-bit-rate product, another important problem appears: the degradation due to intersymbol interference (ISI) stemming from dispersions or nonlinearities. Therefore, the bit error rate (BER) after propagation results from both SNR and ISI degradation. In order to fully understand the system behavior, it is required to separate the different contributions to BER degradation.

Passive double star (PDS) optical networks are expected to be used to construct low cost access networks for broadband services.

When the reflections are completely separated, we can identify faults with the conventional method described above.

Summary form only given. To many, the rapid deployment of dense-wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) line systems in world-wide telecommunications networks heralds a new age-the age of Optical Networking. While line systems in and of themselves support little in terms of networking functionality, DWDM line systems with wavelength add/drop capability are being deployed, and demonstrations (and lab/field trials) of optical network elements with nodal features, such as WDM add/drop multiplexers and optical cross-connects are being reported. The ability to add, drop, and in effect construct wavelength-switched and wavelength-routed networks, facilitated by these WDM optical nodal elements, does indeed herald the dawning of an age of optical networking. As such, it presents an attractive opportunity to design survivable optical WDM network architectures, using WDM optical nodal elements as tools analogous to those currently used at the electrical (e.g., SONET/SDH) layer. The emergence of survivable WDM optical network architectures will likely mirror the emergence of SONET/SDH survivable architectures. Both SONET/SDW and WDM optical survivable architectures have been classified as either protection switching or restoration architectures, wherein the distinction between the two has largely been based upon differences in restoral time frame, and degree of autonomy. Providing survivability, either in the form of protection switching, restoration, or some combination of both, at the optical layer is inherently attractive.","publicationTitle":"OFC '98.

Amid mounting evidence of explosive growth in demand for long-haul, high-bit-rate services, it is becoming increasingly important to devise economical ways to restore wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks that transport large aggregate traffic volumes. There are two broad means of addressing this challenge. One approach restores traffic at the wavelength-path level-i.e., by independently routing individual restored wavelengths. The second restores traffic aggregated at the wavelength-multiplex-section (WMS) level using, for example, the optical-switch-based approach. We evaluate the prospects for such WMS-level restoration in national-scale long-haul WDM mesh networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Feb. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/657417/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6032903","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"22-27 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optical restoration at the wavelength-multiplex-section level in WDM mesh networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical restoration at the wavelength-multiplex-section level in WDM mesh networks","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00657417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024393S","chronDate":"22-27 Feb. 1998","isNumber":"14321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5284","citationCount":"4","articleId":"657417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":657436,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Wavelength-division multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM PONs) offer the potential of large capacity, network security, and upgradability. However, these networks require low-cost sources, and efficient routing at the central office (CO) and remote nodes (RN) for practical implementation. Proposed WDM PON architectures have used multifrequency lasers, super-luminescent diodes, or distributed feedback (DFB) laser arrays as WDM sources and most employ underutilized waveguide grating routers (WGR) for multiplexing and demultiplexing the upstream and downstream traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate a 15-channel WDM PON (downstream: 500 Mbit/s, upstream: 155 Mbit/s) using a spectrum-sliced fiber amplifier light source and a new architecture that requires only one, fully utilized WGR at the central office and one at the remote node for bi-directional communication.","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1998.657503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1998.657503","startPage":"400","endPage":"401","displayPublicationTitle":"OFC '98.

Robust filter structures are used to attenuate the effect of model uncertainties as much as possible while learning mechanisms such as parameter adaptation are used to reduce the model uncertainties. Under the proposed general framework, a simple new ARC controller is also constructed for a class of nonlinear systems transformable to a semi-strict feedback form. The new design utilizes the popular discontinuous projection method in solving the conflicts between the deterministic robust control design and the adaptive control design. The controller achieves a guaranteed transient performance and a prescribed final tracking accuracy in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities while achieving asymptotic stability in the presence of parametric uncertainties without using a discontinuous control law or infinite-gain feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance adaptive robust control of nonlinear systems: a general framework and new schemes","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.657530","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14225/00657530.pdf","startPage":"2489","endPage":"2494 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.657530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=657530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/657530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"High performance adaptive robust control of nonlinear systems: a general framework and new schemes","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5863781","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance adaptive robust control of nonlinear systems: a general framework and new schemes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00657530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045893S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","citationCount":"92","articleId":"657530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":657532,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The focus is on linear systems with static uncertainty on the state matrix. For this class of uncertain systems, the notion of quadratic stability and the related robustness analysis tests are generalized to arbitrary LMI regions. The resulting tests for robust pole clustering are all numerically tractable since they involve solving LMIs, and cover both unstructured and parameter uncertainty. These analysis results are then applied to the synthesis of dynamic output-feedback controllers that robustly assign the closed-loop poles in a prescribed LMI region. With some conservatism, this problem is again tractable via LMI optimization. In addition, robust pole placement can be combined with other control objectives such as H/sub 2/ or H/sub /spl infin// performance to capture realistic sets of design specifications. Physically-motivated examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches for robust analysis and synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.657634","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14272/00657634.pdf","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1296 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.657634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust pole placement in LMI regions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/657634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Robust pole placement in LMI regions","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5850594","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust pole placement in LMI regions","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00657634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042067S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","citationCount":"6","articleId":"657634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":657661,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

In particular, no measurements of the gradient of the loss function are assumed available. The simultaneous perturbation SA (SPSA) algorithm has successfully addressed one of the major shortcomings of those finite-difference SA algorithms by significantly reducing the number of measurements required in many multivariate problems of practical interest. This paper presents a second-order SPSA algorithm that is based on estimating both the loss function gradient and inverse Hessian matrix at each iteration. The aim of this approach is to emulate the acceleration properties associated with deterministic algorithms of Newton-Raphson form, particularly in the terminal phase where the first-order SPSA algorithm slows down in its convergence. This second-order SPSA algorithm requires only five loss function measurements at each iteration, independent of the problem dimension. This paper represents a significantly enhanced version of a previously introduced second-order algorithm by the author (1996).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.657661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14272","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14272/00657661.pdf","endPage":"1424 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated second-order stochastic optimization using only function measurements","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.657661","startPage":"1417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=657661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated second-order stochastic optimization using only function measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/657661/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5850602","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated second-order stochastic optimization using only function measurements","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00657661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030944S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","citationCount":"19","articleId":"657661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":657673,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jun Wang","id":"37087146257"},{"name":"Qingni Hu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Qingni Hu","id":"37087275700"},{"name":"Dan-Chi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dan-Chi Jiang","id":"37087601029"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4187-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"657673","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Kinematics","Manipulators","Jacobian matrices","Automatic control","Robot sensing systems","Robotics and automation","Orbital robotics","Nonlinear equations","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","kinematic control","redundant manipulators","neuron arrays","joint velocity vector","asymptotic tracking","motion control","stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=657673","abstract":"A recurrent neural network is presented for the kinematic control of kinematically redundant robot manipulators.

Contrary to most of the existing work in the control literature we explicitly treat all the dynamic and nonlinear characteristics of this system. A desired symmetric periodic orbit locally stable is generated by a PD control scheme. In order to enlarge the basin of attraction of this orbit we propose the use of a hybrid control in addition to the PD control. This work finds potential application in several areas including the control of kinematic chains with joint clearance and vibro-impact systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the control of

A simulation study was conducted to determine the peak power and energy requirements over the SAE recommended electric vehicle test procedure. A scaled prototype SESU was built using flywheel energy storage, and tests were performed to determine the energy transfer capabilities of a flywheel coupled high speed permanent magnet synchronous machine through the proposed system's energy storage tank. Results are presented that indicate the necessity of the energy storage tank.

The moonie transducers were modified systematically by using finite element analysis combined with experimental techniques. A new transducer design, named \"cymbal transducer\", was developed with larger displacement, larger generative forces, and more cost-effective manufacturing. The cymbal transducers consist of a cylindrical ceramic element sandwiched between two truncated conical metal endcaps and can be used as both sensors and actuators. The cymbal actuator exhibits almost 40 times higher displacement than the same size of ceramic element. Effective piezoelectric charge coefficient, Eff. d/sub 33/, of cymbal is roughly 40 times higher than PZT itself.","doi":"10.1109/58.658312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14326/00658312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.658312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14326","startPage":"597","endPage":"605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite piezoelectric transducer with truncated conical endcaps \"cymbal\"","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Composite piezoelectric transducer with truncated conical endcaps \"cymbal\"","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5612166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite piezoelectric transducer with truncated conical endcaps \"cymbal\"","sourcePdf":"00658312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037776S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"14326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"179","articleId":"658312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658333,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The first employs cross-correlation between signals on all pairs of neighboring elements. In the other, cross-correlation between signals on all elements and the beamsum is used. Here, the two methods are studied in detail, and the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed. It is shown that cross-correlations between neighboring elements result in a bias in the estimated phase profile, while correlations to the beamsum result in higher error variance. A new approach combining the two is introduced. Experimental results demonstrate that this new method provides a superior phase aberration profile. Furthermore, it is shown that this improved phase profile enhances image quality when used to correct both transmitter and receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14326/00658333.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.658333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.658333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved estimation of phase aberration profiles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase estimation","Speckle","Phased arrays","Concurrent computing","Image quality","Transmitters","Frequency dependence","Biomedical imaging","Acoustic propagation","Acoustic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speckle","acoustic correlation","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase aberration profile","single transmit pulse","speckle","cross-correlation","beamsum","ultrasonic imaging","transmitter","receiver","error variance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Improved estimation of phase aberration profiles","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5612180","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved estimation of phase aberration profiles","sourcePdf":"00658333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058629S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"14326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"72","articleId":"658333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":658335,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The array is mounted on the surface of a 1.2 mm diameter catheter appropriate for coronary artery applications. Integrated into the catheter tip is a custom analog chip set permitting complete data capture from the array. That is, on each firing any combination of array elements can be selected independently as transmitter or receiver. Using data acquired in this way, a complete phased array aperture (i.e., independent transmit and receive apertures) can be synthesized. Reconstruction hardware based on a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) has been designed and built to produce real-time images. Beam forming coefficients are derived using an optimal filtering approach accounting for the circular geometry of the array. Simulated and measured beam patterns for this system are compared. In addition, images of coronary anatomy acquired with the real-time system are displayed demonstrating the marked image quality improvement compared to previous synthetic aperture intraluminal systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14326/00658335.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.658335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.658335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthetic phased arrays for intraluminal imaging of coronary arteries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Ultrasonic imaging","Ultrasonic transducer arrays","Catheters","Apertures","Application specific integrated circuits","Ceramics","Piezoelectric transducers","Ultrasonic transducers","Arteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic transducer arrays","piezoelectric transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","haemodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic phased array","coronary artery","ceramic piezoelectric transducer","ultrasonic intraluminal imaging","catheter","analog chip","data capture","reconstruction hardware","custom ASIC","beam forming coefficients","optimal filtering","real-time system","20 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic phased arrays for intraluminal imaging of coronary arteries","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5612181","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic phased arrays for intraluminal imaging of coronary arteries","sourcePdf":"00658335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067038S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"14326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"88","articleId":"658335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":658381,"authors":[{"name":"Mei-Ling Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mei-Ling Chiang","id":"37611413200"},{"name":"P.C.H.

Flash memory is small, lightweight, shock-resistant, nonvolatile, and requires little power. Writing to flash memory segments requires erasing the segment in advance. However, erase operations are slow and power-wasting and usually decrease system performance. The number of erase cycles is also limited. To reduce the number of erase operations needed and to evenly wear the flash memory, a new flash memory management scheme has been designed. A new cleaning policy is also proposed to reduce cleaning overhead. Performance evaluations show that erase operations can be reduced by 55%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing flash memory in personal communication devices","publicationTitle":"ISCE '97.

One of the keys to achieving this potential is a complete, automatic mapping solution that creates high-quality mappings in the shortest possible time. In this paper, we consider one step in this process, the assignment of inter-FPGA signals to specific I/O pins on the FPGAs in a multi-FPGA system. We show that this problem can neither be handled by pin assignment methods developed for other applications nor standard routing algorithms. Although current mapping systems ignore this issue, we show that an intelligent pin assignment method can achieve both quality and mapping speed improvements over random approaches. Intelligent pin assignment methods already exist for multi-FPGA systems, but are restricted to topologies where logic-bearing FPGAs cannot be directly connected. In this paper, we provide three new algorithms for the pin assignment of multi-FPGA systems with arbitrary topologies. We compare these approaches on several mappings to current multi-FPGA systems, and show that the force-directed approach produces better mappings, in significantly shorter time, than any of the other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/43.658564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/14342/00658564.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.658564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pin assignment for multi-FPGA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658564/","displayDocTitle":"Pin assignment for multi-FPGA systems","volume":"16","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5871995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pin assignment for multi-FPGA systems","sourcePdf":"00658564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020929S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"14342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"9","articleId":"658564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":658565,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We study the scaling of clock power dissipation with increasing die sizes, number of receivers, and operating frequencies. The analysis shows that buffering only at the root of the tree is not scalable. However, when buffered clock trees are allowed, the classical H tree is suboptimal in terms of both area and power dissipation. We show that the new power minimization problem is NP hard, and we propose a novel algorithm for low-power clock network design. Our algorithm designs the tree topology and inserts buffers simultaneously. The clock skew is guaranteed to be small in the presence of correlated process variations. Wire sizing is used when necessary, and clock skew can be inserted intentionally if required. The results obtained by our algorithm on benchmark problem instances are significantly better than previous approaches in terms of power dissipation, wire length, rise times, and buffer area.

One motivation for studying this problem is the current need for good partitioning tools for implementing a circuit on multiple field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips. We allow duplication of logic gates as it could be used to reduce circuit delay. Circuit partitioning with duplication of logic gates is also called circuit clustering. In this paper, we present a circuit clustering algorithm that minimizes circuit delay subject to both area and pin constraints on each chip, using the general delay model. We develop a repeated network cut technique for finding a cluster that is bounded by both area and pin constraints. Our algorithm achieves optimal delay under either the area constraint only or the pin constraint only. Under both area and pin constraints, our algorithm achieves optimal delay in most cases. We outline the condition under which the nonoptimality occurs, and we show that the condition rarely occurs in practice. We tested our algorithm on a set of benchmark circuits, and consistently obtained optimal or near-optimal delays.","doi":"10.1109/43.658566","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"976","endPage":"986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/14342/00658566.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.658566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit clustering for delay minimization under area and pin constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Minimization","Clustering algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Logic gates","Logic circuits","Circuit testing","Programmable logic arrays","Partitioning algorithms","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","minimisation","delays","circuit optimisation","circuit CAD","integrated circuit design","logic CAD","logic partitioning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit clustering","delay minimization","area constraint","pin constraint","circuit partitioning","multiple FPGA chip","logic gate duplication","network cut technique","algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Circuit clustering for delay minimization under area and pin constraints","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5871997","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658566/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit clustering for delay minimization under area and pin constraints","sourcePdf":"00658566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053404S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"14342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"28","articleId":"658566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658571,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

New approaches are needed to augment the existing techniques, both to reduce execution time and to improve fault coverage. Genetic algorithms (GA's) have been effective in solving many search and optimization problems. Since test generation is a search process over a large vector space, it is an ideal candidate for GA's. In this work, we describe a GA framework for sequential circuit test generation. The GA evolves candidate test vectors and sequences, using a fault simulator to compute the fitness of each candidate test. Various GA parameters are studied, including alphabet size, fitness function, generation gap, population size, and mutation rate, as well as selection and crossover schemes. High fault coverages were obtained for most of the ISCAS'89 sequential benchmark circuits, and execution times were significantly lower than in a deterministic test generator in most cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5872002","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm framework for test generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm framework for test generation","sourcePdf":"00658571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061478S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"14342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"58","articleId":"658571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658573,"authors":[{"name":"C.Z.

They have undergone a number of alterations to deal with language and measurement uncertainties. We present another modification, aimed at combining symbolic decision trees with approximate reasoning offered by fuzzy representation. The intent is to exploit complementary advantages of both: popularity in applications to learning from examples, high knowledge comprehensibility of decision trees, and the ability to deal with inexact and uncertain information of fuzzy representation. The merger utilizes existing methodologies in both areas to full advantage, but is by no means trivial. In particular, knowledge inferences must be newly defined for the fuzzy tree. We propose a number of alternatives, based on rule-based systems and fuzzy control. We also explore capabilities that the new framework provides. The resulting learning method is most suitable for stationary problems, with both numerical and symbolic features, when the goal is both high knowledge comprehensibility and gradually changing output. We describe the methodology and provide simple illustrations.","doi":"10.1109/3477.658573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3477/14343/00658573.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.658573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy decision trees: issues and methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658573/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy decision trees: issues and methods","volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5824677","pubMedId":"18255917","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy decision trees: issues and methods","sourcePdf":"00658573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091289S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"411","articleId":"658573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":658574,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A fuzzy entropy measuring the blur in an image is a functional which increases when the sharpness of its argument image decreases. We generalize and extend the relation \"sharper than\" between fuzzy sets in view of implementing the properties of a relation \"sharper than\" between images. We show that there are infinitely many implementations of this relation into an ordering between fuzzy sets (equivalently, images). Relying upon these orderings, we construct classes of fuzzy entropies which are useful for image thresholding by cost minimization. Assuming the image to be a degraded version of an ideal two level image (object/background), a fuzzy entropy can be introduced in a cost functional to force the fitting function to be as close as possible to a two-valued function. The minimization problem is numerically solved, and the results obtained on a synthetic image are reported.","doi":"10.1109/3477.658574","startPage":"15","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3477/14343/00658574.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.658574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image thresholding using fuzzy entropies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Fuzzy sets","Cost function","Degradation","Pixel","Image analysis","Fuzzy set theory","Upper bound","Background noise","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","entropy","fuzzy set theory","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image thresholding","fuzzy entropy","fuzzy subset","image blur","fuzzy set theory","cost minimization","two level image","cost functional","two valued function","synthetic image","image analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Image thresholding using fuzzy entropies","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5824678","pubMedId":"18255918","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image thresholding using fuzzy entropies","sourcePdf":"00658574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035836S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"47","articleId":"658574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":658577,"authors":[{"name":"Yaochu Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yaochu Jin","id":"37087147071"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"658577","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":349},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Fuzzy control","Robots","Manipulators","Fuzzy systems","Genetic algorithms","Control systems","Gradient methods","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","manipulators","adaptive control","decentralised control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy control","fuzzy control","robot manipulators","genetic algorithm","gradient method","feedforward fuzzy torque-computing","feedback fuzzy PD system","computational complexity","closed-loop system"]}],"abstract":"This paper develops a decentralized adaptive fuzzy control scheme for robot manipulators via a combination of genetic algorithm and gradient method. The controller for each link consists of a feedforward fuzzy torque-computing system and a feedback fuzzy PD system. The feedforward fuzzy system is trained and optimized off-line by an improved genetic algorithm, that is to say, not only the parameters but also the structure of the fuzzy system are self-organized. Because genetic algorithm can operate successfully without the system model, no exact inverse dynamics of the robot system are required. The feedback fuzzy PD system, on the other hand, is tuned on-line using gradient method. In this way, the proportional and derivative gains are adjusted properly to keep the closed-loop system stable. The proposed controller has the following merits: (1) it needs no exact dynamics of the robot systems and the computation is time-saving because of the simple structure of the fuzzy systems; and (2) the controller is insensitive to various dynamics and payload uncertainties in robot systems. These are demonstrated by analyses of the computational complexity and various computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/3477.658577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3477/14343/00658577.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.658577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized adaptive fuzzy control of robot manipulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658577/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized adaptive fuzzy control of robot manipulators","volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5824681","pubMedId":"18255921","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized adaptive fuzzy control of robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00658577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039541S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"70","articleId":"658577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":658578,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Many recognition algorithms are being developed in the research community, and there is a need for establishing ways to compare them.

Also, with respect to a particular task, we propose a method for finding an upper limit to the letter recognition rate to aim for.","doi":"10.1109/3477.658580","startPage":"78","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.658580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14343","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3477/14343/00658580.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human identification of letters in mixed-script handwriting: an upper bound on recognition rates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658580/","displayDocTitle":"Human identification of letters in mixed-script handwriting: an upper bound on recognition rates","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5824684","pubMedId":"18255924","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human identification of letters in mixed-script handwriting: an upper bound on recognition rates","sourcePdf":"00658580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043811S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"8","articleId":"658580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":658583,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We show, how basic experiments and general simulation procedures can be used to determine optimum operating conditions for the intended applications. Besides a comprehensive investigation of FWM among continuous waves, we present new experimental results on FWM with picosecond optical pulses. A comparison of both reveals a different behavior and demonstrates that new optimization criteria and advanced theoretical models have to be applied for the case of short optical pulses. Moreover, we discuss the possibility to extract the dynamical SOA parameters from our experiments.","doi":"10.1109/2944.658587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/2944/14344/00658587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.658587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers for frequency conversion and fast optical switching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Four-wave mixing","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Frequency conversion","Optical signal processing","Optical pulses","All-optical networks","Nonlinear optical devices","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Optical mixing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor lasers","optical transmitters","multiwave mixing","optical frequency conversion","wavelength division multiplexing","optical information processing","electro-optical switches","high-speed optical techniques","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-wave mixing","semiconductor optical amplifiers","frequency conversion","fast optical switching","all-optical communication networks","review","nonlinear optical components","signal processing applications.","general simulation procedures","optimum operating conditions","picosecond optical pulses","optimization criteria","short optical pulses","dynamical SOA parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Four-wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers for frequency conversion and fast optical switching","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5817470","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658587/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers for frequency conversion and fast optical switching","sourcePdf":"00658587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096927S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"14344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"129","articleId":"658587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":658588,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

The circuits use arrayed-waveguide grating multiplexers (AWGMs) to filter and route signals in and out of the SOAs. The AWGM's minimize the component count in the circuits and may lead to future integration of wavelength converters. We experimentally demonstrate a XGM wavelength converter with copropagating pump and probe signals and report its bit-error-rate (BER) performance at 2.5 Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/2944.658593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/2944/14344/00658593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.658593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable optical wavelength converters with reconfigurable functionality","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical wavelength conversion","Tunable circuits and devices","Optical filters","Probes","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Optical modulation","Optical pumping","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuning","optical frequency conversion","phase modulation","optical modulation","integrated optoelectronics","wavelength division multiplexing","semiconductor lasers","optical pumping","diffraction gratings","optical waveguides","multiplexing equipment","optical filters","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable optical wavelength converters","reconfigurable functionality","tunable all-optical wavelength converters","cross-gain modulation","cross-phase modulation","semiconductor optical amplifiers","copropagating pump/probe signals","counterpropagating pump/probe signals","arrayed-waveguide grating multiplexers","route signals","component count","XGM wavelength converter","bit-error-rate","2.5 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Tunable optical wavelength converters with reconfigurable functionality","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5817475","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658593/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable optical wavelength converters with reconfigurable functionality","sourcePdf":"00658593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062324S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"14344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"11","articleId":"658593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":658594,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The model is based on the density matrix equations, which under realistic operation conditions are shown to lead to an accurate description of the material gain, that includes the dynamics of carrier heating and spectral-hole burning (SHB). A very general and compact description of the amplifier dynamics in terms of an integral equation is derived. The model is used to analyze saturation effects in short pulse amplification and nondegenerate four-wave mixing. An analytical expression for the four-wave mixing response is derived, which extends previous results to the case of short and intense pulses. Saturation of the four-wave mixing signal is shown to be strongly pulsewidth dependent due to ultrafast gain dynamics, and self-phase modulation is shown to give excessive broadening of the conjugate pulse. Finally, the impacts on the noise characteristics are calculated and shown to explain recent experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.658594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/2944/14344/00658594.pdf","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1207","doi":"10.1109/2944.658594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation effects in nondegenerate four-wave mixing between short optical pulses in semiconductor laser amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Saturation effects in nondegenerate four-wave mixing between short optical pulses in semiconductor laser amplifiers","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5817476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation effects in nondegenerate four-wave mixing between short optical pulses in semiconductor laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00658594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047959S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"14344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"152","articleId":"658594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":658600,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-F.

This new approach also elucidates several previously unknown design criteria for reducing close-in phase noise by identifying the mechanisms by which intrinsic device noise and external noise sources contribute to the total phase noise. In particular, it explains the details of how 1/f noise in a device upconverts into close-in phase noise and identifies methods to suppress this upconversion. The theory also naturally accommodates cyclostationary noise sources, leading to additional important design insights. The model reduces to previously available phase noise models as special cases. Excellent agreement among theory, simulations, and measurements is observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658619/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","volume":"33","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5825461","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A general theory of phase noise in electrical oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general theory of phase noise in electrical oscillators","sourcePdf":"00658619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084501S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"1512","articleId":"658619","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":658622,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A key component in these designs is the NMOS sampling switch. It can sample a very high bandwidth signal, several GHz for a 0.8-/spl mu/m transistor. We present an expression for the aperture time for an NMOS switch when the input has low swing. The switch can, under this condition, be modeled as a device that determines a weighted average over time of the input signal. The weight function is derived. The aperture time function shows that the maximum theoretical time resolution for a switch in 0.8-/spl mu/m standard CMOS is 21 ps (/spl sim/48 Gb/s). SPICE simulations agree with the theory. Transient two-dimensional (2-D) device simulations do not contradict the predicted results.

The basic idea of the circuits is to synthesize transfer characteristics by key logic elements, namely, up and down literals. We first describe two fundamental logic circuits based on this idea: a ternary inverter and a literal gate. Then we present experimental results on these circuits fabricated by integrating InP-based RTDs and HEMTs. It is found that these circuits operate successfully with threshold voltages and output levels that have been predicted from individual device characteristics. Consequently, the validity of the basic idea behind the circuits presented here is proven. The device counts and the number of logic stages required for the present circuits are less than half those for conventional ones. A possible application is finally discussed.","doi":"10.1109/4.658629","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/14352/00658629.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.658629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"268","endPage":"274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resonant-tunneling diode and HEMT logic circuits with multiple thresholds and multilevel output","volume":"33","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5832150","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant-tunneling diode and HEMT logic circuits with multiple thresholds and multilevel output","sourcePdf":"00658629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044745S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"73","articleId":"658629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658630,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jin Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering Microwave Application Research Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Jin Jeon","id":"37087730370"},{"name":"Man-Young Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering Microwave Application Research Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Man-Young Jeon","id":"37087919888"},{"name":"Jin-Myung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering Microwave Application Research Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Myung Kim","id":"37087919267"},{"name":"Yoon-Ha Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering Microwave Application Research Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yoon-Ha Jeong","id":"37087153704"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Dong Yang University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Ho Jeong","id":"37087916457"},{"name":"Dae Mann Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering Microwave Application Research Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae Mann Kim","id":"37087215843"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"658630","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Circuit topology","Noise figure","Circuit noise","Noise measurement","Gallium arsenide","MESFETs","Feedback circuits","Circuit stability","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","field effect MMIC","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","MESFET integrated circuits","integrated circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback low-noise-amplifiers","X-band","MESFET","noise matching","power matching","minimum noise figure","common source parallel feedback","common source series feedback","optimal series feedback","short stub length","input/output voltage standing wave ratios","0.5 micron","22 to 23 dB","8 to 10 GHz","GaAs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658630","doi":"10.1109/4.658630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.658630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/14352/00658630.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic feedback low noise X-band amplifiers using 0.5-/spl mu/m GaAs MESFETs: comparative theoretical study and experimental characterization","abstract":"Three different feedback low-noise-amplifier (LNA) circuit topologies for simultaneous noise and power matching are theoretically investigated and compared for the X-band application.

In this LNA circuit, an optimal series feedback for noise figure, gain, and stability is implemented via a proper choice of the short stub length. The size of the fabricated monolithic microwave integrated LNA chip is only 1 mm/sup 2//stage. The measured gain varies from 22.0 to 23.0 dB in the frequency range of 8 to 10 GHz, with good flatness. The input/output voltage standing wave ratios are less than 2 and 1.43, respectively. The noise figure of the three-stage LNA is less than 2.6 dB.

The technique presented is based on current replication and comparison. Traditional techniques rely on the matching of an N transistors array, where N is the number of system inputs. This implies that when N increases, as the size of the circuit and the distance between transistors will also increase, transistor matching degradation and loss of precision in the overall system performance will result. Furthermore, when multichip systems are required, the transistor matching is even worse and performance is drastically degraded. The technique presented in this paper does not rely on the proper matching of N transistors, but on the precise replication and comparison of currents. This can be performed by current mirrors with a limited number of outputs. Thus, N can increase without degrading the precision, even if the system is distributed among several chips. Also, the different chips constituting the system can be of different foundries without degrading the overall system precision. Experimental results that attest these facts are presented.","doi":"10.1109/4.658631","startPage":"280","endPage":"286","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/14352/00658631.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.658631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-precision current-mode WTA-MAX circuit with multichip capability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Circuit topology","Circuit synthesis","System performance","Mirrors","Foundries","Analog circuits","Analog computers","Fuzzy systems","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","integrated circuit design","analogue processing circuits","circuit stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-mode WTA-MAX circuit","multichip capability","circuit design technique","winner-take-all","loser-take-all","current replication","system inputs","transistor matching degradation","current comparison","current mirrors","system precision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"A high-precision current-mode WTA-MAX circuit with multichip capability","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5825469","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-precision current-mode WTA-MAX circuit with multichip capability","sourcePdf":"00658631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03589S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"40","articleId":"658631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658632,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The following three items were newly observed. First, the threshold voltage shift (/spl Delta/V/sub th/) of the memory cell under the gate bias condition (read disturb condition) consists of two regions, a decay region and a steady-state region. The decay region is due to both the initial trapping or detrapping of the carriers in the tunnel oxide and the decay of the stress-induced leakage current of the tunnel oxide. The steady-state region is determined by the saturation of the stress-induced leakage current of the tunnel oxide. Second, the read disturb life time is mainly determined by the steady-state region for the oxide thickness of 5.7-10.6 nm investigated here. Third, a high-temperature (125/spl deg/C) write/erase operation degrades the steady-state region characteristics in comparison with room temperature (30/spl deg/C) operation. Therefore, accelerated write/erase tests can be carried out at higher operation temperatures.","doi":"10.1109/16.658684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.658684","endPage":"486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/14348/00658684.pdf","startPage":"482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stress-induced leakage current of tunnel oxide derived from flash memory read-disturb characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658684/","displayDocTitle":"Stress-induced leakage current of tunnel oxide derived from flash memory read-disturb characteristics","volume":"45","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5818719","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stress-induced leakage current of tunnel oxide derived from flash memory read-disturb characteristics","sourcePdf":"00658684.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099751S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"55","articleId":"658684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658688,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Chen","affiliation":["Microelectronic Materials and Structures and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Chun Chen","id":"37351218700"},{"name":"Tso-Ping Ma","affiliation":["Microelectronic Materials and Structures and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Tso-Ping Ma","id":"37271893500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"658688","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"A simple charge pumping method has been developed to measure the localized hot-carrier damage in scaled thin-gate MOSFET's. Lateral distributions of both interface traps and oxide charge can be derived directly from experimental charge pumping results without numerical simulation. By the use of this method, we have studied the erase-induced hot-carrier damage in flash EPROM devices, including the lateral distributions of both oxide charge (trapped holes) and interface traps. We discovered the following: the damage is confined within the source diffusion region with a rather wide distribution; the erase-induced oxide charge density is orders of magnitude more than erase-induced interface traps; both the peak density and width of the damage depend strongly on the junction bias during the erase operation. These results should be very useful for the reliability modeling and future device design of flash EPROM's.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/14348/00658688.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.658688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.658688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct lateral profiling of hot-carrier-induced oxide charge and interface traps in thin gate MOSFET's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hot carriers","MOSFET circuits","EPROM","Voltage","Charge pumps","Flash memory","Leakage current","Insulation","Tunneling","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hot carriers","hole traps","electron traps","MOSFET","interface states","EPROM","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct lateral profiling","hot-carrier-induced oxide charge","hot-carrier-induced interface traps","thin gate MOSFET","charge pumping method","localized hot-carrier damage","scaled MOSFETs","lateral distributions","erase-induced hot-carrier damage","flash EPROM devices","source diffusion region","junction bias","reliability modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Direct lateral profiling of hot-carrier-induced oxide charge and interface traps in thin gate MOSFET's","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5825477","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct lateral profiling of hot-carrier-induced oxide charge and interface traps in thin gate MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00658688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047233S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"92","articleId":"658688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658712,"authors":[{"name":"N.T.

The basic idea is to measure the reaction of the stator current on the change of the rotor flux during the \"short circuit at machine terminals\" inverter state. A generalization is possible by a combination of two different active states of the inverter. By a linear transformation of the electrical equations for both inverter states, a mathematical zero state is constructed. The use of this virtual short circuit is necessary at higher speed when the inverter output voltage is fully utilized. Both variants were implemented in real time on an induction motor drive with an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter and floating-point digital signal processor (DSP). In order not to disturb the current controller, the algorithms use naturally occurring inverter switching states only. Measurement results during load steps demonstrate the excellent flux information of the method.","doi":"10.1109/28.658738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.658738","endPage":"147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/28/14349/00658738.pdf","startPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMF-based rotor flux detection in induction motors using virtual short circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658738/","displayDocTitle":"EMF-based rotor flux detection in induction motors using virtual short circuits","volume":"34","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5825578","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMF-based rotor flux detection in induction motors using virtual short circuits","sourcePdf":"00658738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02332S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","isNumber":"14349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"12","articleId":"658738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658747,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Most drive systems are separately derived through a step-down transformer, which serves as a drive isolation, as well as rectifier transformer. Isolation transformers on individual or group drive systems, downstream of main substation transformers are also common. An output isolation transformer on an AC drive will isolate the drive electronics, step up the AC voltage from the inverter section and also serve to control high line-to-ground voltages on the motor windings. The grounding system has a profound effect upon the continuity of operations, loading of the solid-state devices and common-mode voltages.

It has had profound impact on the way we live and the way we work. The first part of this paper covers the events that led to the discovery of the transistor effect and the invention of the point contact transistor in December of 1947. It continues with the development of the theory of the junction transistor in early 1948 and the fabrication of the first grown junction transistor in 1950. It is fair to say that this event completed the invention of the transistor and developed a fundamental understanding of how it worked. The second part of the paper describes the major hurdles that had to be overcome and the major breakthroughs that had to be made to turn an exciting invention into a far reaching technical innovation. This phase took approximately another 10 years. By that time, high performance, high reliability transistors could be manufactured in large quantity and at low cost. Importantly the foundation had been laid for the invention of the integrated circuit and the dramatic development of the microelectronics industry. The final part of the paper suggests some of the reasons why such an important technological innovation could occur in a relatively short period of time and be such an unqualified success. Finally, there are some comments on how much further this technology can go and when its rapid progress may come to an end.","doi":"10.1109/5.658752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.658752","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/14340/00658752.pdf","startPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The invention of the transistor","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658752/","displayDocTitle":"The invention of the transistor","volume":"86","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5847633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The invention of the transistor","sourcePdf":"00658752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061568S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"30","articleId":"658752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658761,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

This C/sub 60/ molecular device works by electromechanical modulation of virtual resonance quantum mechanical tunneling. The equivalent of the grid is achieved by the purely mechanical action of compressing the C/sub 60/ cage voltage. This action reversibly changes the internal electronic structure of the molecule, increasing its conductance in a continuous manner. The first embodiment provides experimental verification with a measured voltage gain of five. The implications of these results indicate a new approach to electronics on the nanoscale, working in a new transport regime for the three-terminal devices. Going beyond these experiments, we discuss possible approaches of creating single-molecule devices and the advantages they promise.","doi":"10.1109/5.658770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.658770","startPage":"184","endPage":"190","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/14340/00658770.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nanoscale single-molecule amplifier and its consequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"A nanoscale single-molecule amplifier and its consequences","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"86","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5841119","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658770/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nanoscale single-molecule amplifier and its consequences","sourcePdf":"00658770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046012S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"27","articleId":"658770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":658775,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Such an alignment requires low-coupling loss and large positional alignment tolerances. This is achievable with integrated spot-size converters, which permit to match the near field of a laser to that of a flat-end single-mode fiber (SMF). In this paper, we first review briefly the different technological approaches to realize spot-size converters. Then, we focus on the double-core structure developed both for 1.3-/spl mu/m Fabry-Perot lasers and 1.55-/spl mu/m semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). The spot-size expansion is simulated using a two-dimensional (2-D) beam propagation method analysis. Short spot-size converters (100 /spl mu/m) integrated with 1.3-/spl mu/m lasers and 1.55-/spl mu/m SOAs exhibit beam divergences as low as 12/spl deg//spl times/12/spl deg/ and 12/spl deg//spl times/15/spl deg/, respectively. The performances of devices with integrated spot-size converters are reported and discussed.

Using an adaptive multilevel Green's function and low-order polynomials as shape function, we apply the Galerkin principle over finite elements, and most of the surface integrals of charge distribution can be evaluated analytically and the singular integrals can be eliminated by choosing proper coordinate transformation.

Both effects are evidently due to similar thermally activated processes involving hydrogen. The increased noise through irradiation and anneal is found to be caused not only by the generation of defects at or near the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface, but also by an apparent transition from buried to surface channel conduction. This is evidently triggered by the passivation of dopants in the Si by hydrogen transport during irradiation and anneal. Switched bias annealing confirms many of these effects are reversible. Three types of hydrogen transport are identified in MOS oxides: dispersive transport leading to \"two-stage\" interface-trap buildup, retarded transport leading to latent interface-trap buildup, and blockaded transport leading to proton confinement in SiO/sub 2/. The nature of the transport appears to correlate with O vacancy density and the temperature at which hydrogen is incorporated into the SiO/sub 2/. Implications are discussed for enhanced bipolar low dose rate response, the sensitivity of pMOS dosimeters, and protonic nonvolatile memory elements.","doi":"10.1109/23.658947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/23/14336/00658947.pdf","startPage":"1810","endPage":"1817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.658947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1/f noise, hydrogen transport, and latent interface-trap buildup in irradiated MOS devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658947/","displayDocTitle":"1/f noise, hydrogen transport, and latent interface-trap buildup in irradiated MOS devices","volume":"44","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804553","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1/f noise, hydrogen transport, and latent interface-trap buildup in irradiated MOS devices","sourcePdf":"00658947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030434S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"78","articleId":"658947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658948,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The devices with heavily-doped emitters (1/spl times/10/sup 20/ cm/sup -3/) degrade less than the devices with lightly-doped emitters (1/spl times/10/sup 18/ cm/sup -3/). Both device types are sensitive to interface-trap formation in the oxide above the emitter-base junction and the neutral base region. In addition, the devices with lightly-doped emitters experience spreading of the depletion region into the emitter, increasing their sensitivity to total-dose irradiation. The gain degradation in both device types is due to a combination of increased base current and decreased collector current. The radiation-induced decrease in collector current is more significant for devices from this technology than for other devices studied previously. Increased gain degradation is observed in heavily-doped devices irradiated at low dose rates, but the enhanced degradation appears to be due to time-dependent effects rather than true dose-rate effects. The lightly-doped devices do not exhibit a clear dose-rate trend and the gain of these devices improves during post-irradiation annealing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","volume":"44","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5804565","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-induced gain degradation in lateral PNP BJTs with lightly and heavily doped emitters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-induced gain degradation in lateral PNP BJTs with lightly and heavily doped emitters","sourcePdf":"00658962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050661S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"44","articleId":"658962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658964,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Similar technological and architectural features are used in related technologies such as programmable substrates and quick-turn application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). After analyzing current technologies and architectures and their radiation-effects implications, this paper includes extensive test data quantifying various devices' total dose and single event susceptibilities, including performance degradation effects and temporary or permanent re-configuration faults. Test results will concentrate on recent technologies being used in space flight electronic systems and those being developed for use in the near term. This paper will provide the first extensive study of various configuration memories used in programmable devices. Radiation performance limits and their impacts will be discussed for each design. In addition, the interplay between device scaling, process, bias voltage, design, and architecture will be explored.

We describe some of the projects undertaken in this direction at WS97 [the Fifth LVCSR (large-vocabulary conversational speech recognition) Summer Workshop], held at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, in July-August 1997. We first illustrate a use of hand-labelled phonetic transcriptions of a portion of the Switchboard corpus, in conjunction with statistical techniques, to learn alternatives to canonical pronunciations of words. We then describe the use of these alternative pronunciations in a recognition experiment as well as in the acoustic training of an automatic speech recognition system. Our results show a reduction of the word error rate in both cases-0.9% without acoustic retraining and 2.2% with acoustic retraining.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5863930","conferenceDate":"17-17 Dec. 1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pronunciation modelling for conversational speech recognition: a status report from WS97","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pronunciation modelling for conversational speech recognition: a status report from WS97","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00658973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038818S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256","citationCount":"6","articleId":"658973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658976,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Degradation increases sharply with decreasing dose rate and saturates near 0.005 rad(Si)/s. The amount of degradation enhancement at low dose rates decreases monotonically with total dose. In addition, the effect of ambient temperature on radiation-induced gain degradation at 294 rad(Si)/s was investigated over the range of 25 to 240/spl deg/C. Degradation is enhanced with increasing temperature while simultaneously being moderated by in situ annealing, such that, for a given total dose, an optimum irradiation temperature for maximum degradation results. The optimum irradiation temperature decreases logarithmically with total dose and, for a given dose, is smaller than optimum temperatures reported previously for p-n-p devices. High dose rate irradiation at elevated temperatures is less effective at simulating low dose rate degradation for the n-p-n transistor than for the p-n-p transistors. However, additional degradation of the n-p-n device at elevated temperatures is easily obtained using overtest. Differences in the radiation responses of the device types are attributed to the relative effects of oxide trapped charge on gain degradation. High dose rate irradiation near 125/spl deg/C is found to be suitable for the hardness assurance testing of these devices provided a design margin of at least two is employed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5804574","displayDocTitle":"Hardness assurance testing of bipolar junction transistors at elevated irradiation temperatures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardness assurance testing of bipolar junction transistors at elevated irradiation temperatures","sourcePdf":"00658978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088057S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"107","articleId":"658978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":658981,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this work, burn-in effects are used to demonstrate the potential impact of thermally-activated aging effects on integrated circuit radiation hardness. Static random access memories (SRAMs) from three different commercial technologies were irradiated with different pre-irradiation stress conditions. A reduction in the total dose functional failure level was observed for SRAMs from two of the technologies subjected to pre-irradiation elevated temperature stresses. This is the first time the burn-in effect has been shown to degrade the radiation-induced functional failure level of an IC. SRAM data also show no indication that the burn-in effect will saturate, at least for the conditions examined in this work. These data indicate that long-term aging can result in more device degradation than is accounted for by present hardness assurance test guidelines, potentially causing device and/or system failure during the aging period. While only a few technologies have been examined to date, we suspect other technologies may exhibit similar long-term aging effects. Technique for including aging effects within a hardness assurance test program is outlined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of aging on radiation hardness[CMOS SRAMs]","doi":"10.1109/23.658987","startPage":"2040","endPage":"2047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.658987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/23/14336/00658987.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=658987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/658987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Impact of aging on radiation hardness[CMOS SRAMs]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804579","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of aging on radiation hardness[CMOS SRAMs]","sourcePdf":"00658987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06527S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"26","articleId":"658987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":658989,"authors":[{"name":"E.

ANNs with the proposed architecture have been evaluated on the TIMIT database for phoneme recognition, and are found to give better phoneme recognition performance than ANNs based on standard mel frequency cepstrum input. The lowest achieved phone error rate, 26.7%, is very close to the lowest published result for the core test set of the TIMIT database.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.1997.659000","startPage":"156","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.1997.659000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14244","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel4/5256/14244/00659000.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tonotopic artificial neural network architecture for phoneme probability estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659000/","displayDocTitle":"A tonotopic artificial neural network architecture for phoneme probability estimation","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5856671","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tonotopic artificial neural network architecture for phoneme probability estimation","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00659000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045688S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256","citationCount":"1","articleId":"659000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":659011,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This paper discusses our approach to the decoding problem, including the role of heuristic pruning, the A* criteria and its relation to Viterbi searching and stack searching, as well our approach to problems relating to prefix-tree searching and the application of language models and complex acoustic structures, such as cross-word triphones.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.1997.659022","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel4/5256/14244/00659022.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.1997.659022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Search organization in the Whisper continuous speech recognition system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659022/","displayDocTitle":"Search organization in the Whisper continuous speech recognition system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5856687","conferenceDate":"17-17 Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Search organization in the Whisper continuous speech recognition system","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00659022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043743S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256","citationCount":"3","articleId":"659022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":659023,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

The net positive charge trapped in the buried-oxides during the radiation was determined by dual capacitance-voltage (C-V) and point-contact current voltage (I-V) measurements. For the thermal oxides, using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) CV techniques, the amount of trapped charge was found to have the expected linear dependence on oxide thickness. For the SIMOX buried oxides, however, the amount of net trapped charge was found to be independent of BOX thickness when the oxides were biased at 0.05 MV/cm (a typical operating field). The SIMOX results are explained in terms of bulk-oxide hole and electron trapping.","doi":"10.1109/23.659023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/23/14336/00659023.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.659023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14336","startPage":"2095","endPage":"2100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation induced charge in SIMOX buried oxides: lack of thickness dependence at low applied fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radiation induced charge in SIMOX buried oxides: lack of thickness dependence at low applied fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804587","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation induced charge in SIMOX buried oxides: lack of thickness dependence at low applied fields","sourcePdf":"00659023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049084S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","articleId":"659023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":659028,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It considers three questions: 1. How good can a prediction be? 2. How bad can a prediction be? 3. How does the quality of the prediction depend on the type of orbit? The paper considers one hundred and twenty-six reports of predicted and observed rates. These include updated predictions for the CRRES devices. The analysis then excludes solar particle events, single event burnout, cases with poor statistics, and cases that are essentially duplicates; leaving 77 comparisons. The heavy ion predictions based on the CREME environments and the proton predictions based on the AP8 environments are both very successful for their basic environments, but are less accurate for low earth orbits (LEO). The quality of the results depends strongly on whether the predictions are based on tests with flight parts or with generic parts. The quality also depends on the use of the proper shielding around the part. The results appear consistent with suggested modifications in these environments based on recent space measurements. The methods that are used for upset rate predictions appear to be adequate for the current generation of devices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictions and observations of SEU rates in space","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.659033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/23/14336/00659033.pdf","startPage":"2174","endPage":"2187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.659033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Predictions and observations of SEU rates in space","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804597","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictions and observations of SEU rates in space","sourcePdf":"00659033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099563S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"51","articleId":"659033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":659037,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A majority of the upsets produced by normally incident heavy ions are due to single-particle events that causes a single cell to upset. However, for grazing angles a majority of the upsets produced by heavy-ion irradiation are due to single-particle events that cause two or more cells to change logic states. Experimental evidence of a single proton-induced spallation reaction that causes two adjacent memory cells to change logic states is presented.

Capacitor data are compared to SEGR data from full integrated circuits. A 1/E/sub CR/ dependence is found for critical field to rupture as a function of ion linear energy transfer (LET), consistent with earlier work for power MOSFETS with oxide thicknesses from 30 to 150 nm. More importantly, critical field to rupture increases with decreasing oxide thickness, consistent with increasing oxide breakdown field prior to heavy-ion exposure. This suggests that SEGR need not be a limiting factor as future technologies scale into the deep submicron region.

Eurospeech, vol. 1, p. 107-10, 1997) introduced a novel subspace distribution clustering hidden Markov model (SDCHMM) as an approximation to a continuous-density HMM (CDHMM). Deriving SDCHMMs from CDHMMs requires a definition of multiple streams and a Gaussian clustering scheme. Previously, we have tried 4 and 13 streams, which are common but ad hoc choices. In this paper, we present a simple and coherent definition for streams of any dimension: the streams comprise the most correlated features. The new definition is shown to give better performance in two speech recognition tasks. The clustering scheme of Bocchieri and Mak is an O(n/sup 2/) algorithm which can be slow when the number of Gaussians in the original CDHMMs is large. Now, we have devised a modified k-means clustering scheme using the Bhattacharyya distance as the distance measure between Gaussian clusters. Not only is the new clustering scheme faster but, when combined with the new stream definitions, we now obtain SDCHMMs which perform at least as well as the original CDHMMs (with better results in some cases).","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.1997.659109","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel4/5256/14244/00659109.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.1997.659109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stream derivation and clustering scheme for subspace distribution clustering hidden Markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659109/","displayDocTitle":"Stream derivation and clustering scheme for subspace distribution clustering hidden Markov model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5863935","conferenceDate":"17-17 Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stream derivation and clustering scheme for subspace distribution clustering hidden Markov model","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00659109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038195S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256","citationCount":"5","articleId":"659109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":659110,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

The system implements a \"voting\" or rescoring process to reconcile differences in ASR system outputs. We refer to this system as the NIST Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER) system. As additional knowledge sources are added to an ASR system (e.g. acoustic and language models), error rates are typically decreased. This paper describes a post-recognition process which models the output generated by multiple ASR systems as independent knowledge sources that can be combined and used to generate an output with reduced error rate. To accomplish this, the outputs of multiple of ASR systems are combined into a single, minimal-cost word transition network (WTN) via iterative applications of dynamic programming (DP) alignments. The resulting network is searched by an automatic rescoring or \"voting\" process that selects the output sequence with the lowest score.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.1997.659110","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel4/5256/14244/00659110.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.1997.659110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A post-processing system to yield reduced word error rates: Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659110/","displayDocTitle":"A post-processing system to yield reduced word error rates: Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5856693","conferenceDate":"17-17 Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A post-processing system to yield reduced word error rates: Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER)","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00659110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037752S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256","citationCount":"367","articleId":"659110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":659112,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

A new and simple approach to compensate for these degradations is presented which uses mel-filter-bank (MFB) magnitudes as input features and missing feature theory to dynamically modify the probability computations performed in hidden Markov model recognizers. When the identity of features missing due to filtering or masking is provided, recognition accuracy on a large talker-independent digit recognition task often rises from below 50% to above 95%.

This study proposes a new approach which combines stress classification and speech recognition into one algorithm.

It is shown that this formulation better integrates perceptually induced stress effects for stress independent recognition. This is due to the sub-phoneme (state level) stress classification that is implicitly performed by the algorithm. The proposed N-D HMM method is compared to neutral and multi-styled stress trained 1-D HMM recognizers.

In essence, we regard a stream of unsegmented text (as might be generated from automatic transcription of broadcast news, for example) as being composed of a series of \"topics\" in something like the same way that a stream of speech consists of a series of phonemes. A story on a particular topic can then be viewed as analogous to an utterance of a particular phoneme, and a stream of text can be decoded into a series of topics in the same way that a speech recognizer decodes a stream of speech into a series of phonemes. We identify the boundaries of these topics with story boundaries. Because a segmenter operating in this way assigns a topic label to each story, it is possible (with some modifications) to use the same engine to \"track\" or find successive stories on an event of special interest. We have applied these ideas in some recent experiments on the Topic Detection and Tracking Pilot Study Corpus. Our preliminary results are promising and suggest that this general methodology is likely to be quite successful both at recovering story boundaries and at identifying instances of stories about the same event over time.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel4/5256/14244/00659131.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.1997.659131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.1997.659131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event tracking and text segmentation via hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Broadcasting","Decoding","Speech recognition","Text recognition","Engines","Streaming media","Automatic speech recognition","Event detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event tracking","text segmentation","hidden Markov modeling","clustering techniques","unsegmented text","automatic transcription","broadcast news","phoneme","speech recognizer","story boundaries","topic label","special interest","Topic Detection and Tracking Pilot Study Corpus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Event tracking and text segmentation via hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5863936","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event tracking and text segmentation via hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00659131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066739S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256","citationCount":"1","articleId":"659131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":659140,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It also is usually not possible to provide more than one language for speech recognition per system. The Core Technology Group of Conversant Voice Information Systems, Bell Laboratories has developed a multilingual phoneme and model set (MPMS) that is being used as a base for all telephone-based ASR continuous speech systems being developed in new languages. With a unified set such as the MPMS, it is possible that multiple languages could be available on one system. While the idea of a multilingual phoneme model set is not new, there has been no work that has used a large, telephone-based database consisting of continuous speech samples in more than two languages, obtains commercially acceptable word recognition rates, and that is ready to be marketed. Our system's phoneme set represents six different languages; we have built models based on three languages and tested them using two other languages (for which there were no models); and we have achieved very acceptable word recognition rates of better than 92% (field accuracy). These languages can be incorporated into an existing speech recognition system, available for customers.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.1997.659141","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel4/5256/14244/00659141.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.1997.659141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilingual phoneme and model set: toward a universal base for automatic speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659141/","displayDocTitle":"A multilingual phoneme and model set: toward a universal base for automatic speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5856722","conferenceDate":"17-17 Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilingual phoneme and model set: toward a universal base for automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00659141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106888S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256","citationCount":"7","articleId":"659141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":659142,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The SSPCs distribute and protect power to the various loads within the EXPRESS Rack. The SSPCM is designed with two 120 V DC inputs (main and auxiliary) and includes three 1100 W DC/DC converters to provide the payload 28 V DC. The main 120 V DC bus normally provides the 120 V DC for the payloads and the DC/DC converters. In the event of an undervoltage condition on the main 120 V DC bus, the SSPCM automatically switches the payloads and the DC/DC converters to the auxiliary 120 V DC bus. The SSPCM can be configured on orbit to control which payloads are powered during auxiliary 120 V DC operations. This allows an experiment system to run without crew actions during numerous mission profiles. The SSPCM also provides payload analog and discrete inputs/outputs for experiment use. The SSPCM provides sampling rates up to 1 kHz and data formatting for payload data. Two additional configurations consisting of more power channels and less payload analog and discrete inputs/outputs are also under development for the International Space Station Furnace Facility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jul-1 Aug 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5912476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27 July-1 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"A Solid State Power Controller Module for the International Space Station EXPRESS Rack","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Solid State Power Controller Module for the International Space Station EXPRESS Rack","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00659199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030515S","chronDate":"27 Jul-1 Aug 1997","isNumber":"14355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277","citationCount":"11","articleId":"659199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":659290,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yong Wang","id":"37367886400"},{"name":"E.K.N.

An accurate prediction of the path losses with the use of minimum power would reduce the co-channel interference and allow frequency re-use. It has been found from this study that HGA is ideally suited to MLAN design, since it not only satisfies the optimization of the skewed multiobjective functions and constraints, but also identifies the required minimum number of base-stations. This added feature provides a design trade-off between cost and performance without extra efforts. An example of using HGA for a MLAN is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1997.659297","startPage":"29","endPage":"32 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.1997.659297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14333","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel4/5255/14333/00659297.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave communication system designs using hierarchical genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659297/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave communication system designs using hierarchical genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5945608","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave communication system designs using hierarchical genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00659297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082617S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5255","citationCount":"1","articleId":"659297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":659307,"authors":[{"name":"T.

From the results, it becomes clear that the basic system performance without AIC is good and the AIC is able to cancel the interference and works well in the vehicular environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel4/5255/14333/00659325.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"144 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1997.659325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.1997.659325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband CDMA with TDMA structure, design and performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Time division multiple access","Interference cancellation","Laboratories","National electric code","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Bit rate","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","time division multiple access","interference suppression","land mobile radio","cellular radio","radiofrequency interference","digital radio","adaptive signal processing","error statistics","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband CDMA system","TDMA structure","adaptive interference canceller","RAKE effect","system performance","field test","urban area","vehicular environment","BER","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A wideband CDMA with TDMA structure, design and performance","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5945633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband CDMA with TDMA structure, design and performance","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00659325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075831S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5255","articleId":"659325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":659326,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Measurements on the prototype showed that the acquisition time was 0.79 /spl mu/s. The proposed design is suitable for the low voltage and low power handheld equipment. With minor modification, the design can be applied to other digital cellular applications, such as DCS-1800 handsets.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1997.659367","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel4/5255/14333/00659367.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"320 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.1997.659367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1/spl mu/s fast acquisition 2.4 GHz low voltage frequency synthesizer for FH-CDMA mobile communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659367/","displayDocTitle":"1/spl mu/s fast acquisition 2.4 GHz low voltage frequency synthesizer for FH-CDMA mobile communications","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5945670","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1/spl mu/s fast acquisition 2.4 GHz low voltage frequency synthesizer for FH-CDMA mobile communications","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00659367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058995S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5255","citationCount":"1","articleId":"659367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":659380,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok Wah Hui","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Kwok Wah Hui","id":"37346602500"},{"name":"K.S.

The Banyan network consists of 2/spl times/2 Banyan switching elements. A 2/spl times/2 Banyan switching element with 2-b data width was also fabricated.

Problems remain, however, as objects change appearance, merge, maneuver, move in and out of the field of view, and split due to poor segmentation. This paper presents an approach to the segmentation, two-dimensional motion estimation, and subsequent tracking of multiple objects in sequences of sector scan sonar images. Applications such as ROV obstacle avoidance, visual servoing, and underwater surveillance are relevant. Initially, static and moving objects are distinguished in the sonar image sequence using frequency-domain filtering. Optical flow calculations are then performed on moving objects with significant size to obtain magnitude and direction motion estimates. Matches of these motion estimates, and the future positions they predict, are then used as a basis for identifying corresponding objects in adjacent scans. To enhance robustness, a tracking tree is constructed storing multiple possible correspondences and cumulative confidence values obtained from successive compatibility measures. Deferred decision making is then employed to enable best estimates of object tracks to be updated as subsequent scans produce new information. The method is shown to work well, with good tracking performance when objects merge, split, and change shape. The optical flow is demonstrated to give position prediction errors of between 10 and 50 cm (1%-5% of scan range), with no violation of smoothness assumptions using sample rates between 4 and 1 frames/s.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/48/14388/00659448.pdf","doi":"10.1109/48.659448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.659448","startPage":"31","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust tracking of multiple objects in sector-scan sonar image sequences using optical flow motion estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659448/","displayDocTitle":"Robust tracking of multiple objects in sector-scan sonar image sequences using optical flow motion estimation","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5859500","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust tracking of multiple objects in sector-scan sonar image sequences using optical flow motion estimation","sourcePdf":"00659448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045641S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"51","articleId":"659448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":659449,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The experiment was conducted during the deployment of a tomographic array in the Mediterranean Sea. Drifting the hydrophone up or down from a ship while listening to the transmitted signal created a powerful synthetic aperture at 400 Hz. Wide-band phase-coded signals, typically used in ocean tomography, were found suitable for this application. The displacement length was 100 m and the hydrophone velocity 1 m/s. The obtained resolution of 1/spl deg/ enabled all the rays in the tested middle range configuration to be resolved and identified. Most of them could not have been resolved with a static hydrophone. Several Doppler processing methods are presented. The narrowband approximation leading to fast algorithms is discussed. Phase time series of individual paths obtained with an array-like wave separation method show that the phase coherence of the different multipaths is nearly perfect. An angle/velocity calibration method and a first rough inversion are finally presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5859501","volume":"23","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Vertical synthetic aperture sonar for ocean acoustic tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vertical synthetic aperture sonar for ocean acoustic tomography","sourcePdf":"00659449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030259S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"2","articleId":"659449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":659452,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

IFH employs a carrier that moves smoothly and continuously in frequency, helping to alleviate problems, such as spectral splatter and transient mismatch, which are a concern in conventional phase-locked loop (PLL)-based frequency-hopping spread-spectrum systems. In IFH, the pseudorandom hopping code is passed through a digital interpolation filter prior to controlling the synthesizer instantaneous frequency output. While such filtering is commonly used in data pulse-shaping to improve the spectral characteristics of the modulated carrier, such filtering has not been reported for IFH codes, where the frequency deviations are changing and can span several MHz. The implications of matching the transient responses of two PLL-based frequency synthesizers using this method have also not been reported. Initial simulation and laboratory measurements indicate that, for certain cases, IFH shows a 1.9 dB improvement in received IF power, has a much sharper roll-off of inband phase noise when compared to conventional hopping, and provides a phase-coherent IF after despreading. An IFH transceiver system using /spl Delta/-/spl Sigma/ frequency synthesis and a /spl Delta/-/spl Sigma/ frequency discriminator is proposed. The system would be suitable for integrated mobile radio applications in slow-fading environments.","doi":"10.1109/82.659452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/14373/00659452.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.659452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interpolated frequency-hopping spread-spectrum transceiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659452/","displayDocTitle":"An interpolated frequency-hopping spread-spectrum transceiver","volume":"45","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5833952","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interpolated frequency-hopping spread-spectrum transceiver","sourcePdf":"00659452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049369S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"13","articleId":"659452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":659453,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

We studied efficient direct form structures, and show that only some of them can be used in delta configurations, while others are evidently unstable. In this paper, we focus on the roundoff noise analysis. Of all the direct-form structures, the direct form II transposed (DFIIt) delta structure has the lowest quantization noise level at its output. This structure outperforms both the conventional direct-form (delay) structures, as well as the state-space structures for narrow-band low-pass filters with respect to output roundoff noise. Excellent roundoff noise performance is achieved at the cost of only a minor additional implementation complexity when compared with the corresponding delay realization. Complexity of a signal processor implementation of the DFIIt delta structure, which was found to be the most suitable delta structure for signal processors, is compared with those of the direct form and state-space delay structures. In addition, some hardware implementation aspects are discussed, including the minimization of the internal word length.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IIR filters","Delay","Signal processing","Digital filters","Sampling methods","Quantization","Noise level","Narrowband","Low pass filters","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","IIR filters","roundoff errors","error analysis","low-pass filters","transfer functions","filtering theory","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta operator realizations","direct-form IIR filters","finite-word-length performance","fast sampling","roundoff noise analysis","direct form II transposed delta structure","quantization noise level","narrowband low-pass filters","implementation complexity","signal processor implementation","internal word length minimisation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/82.659455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/14373/00659455.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.659455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delta operator realizations of direct-form IIR filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delta operator realizations of direct-form IIR filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659455/","volume":"45","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5833955","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delta operator realizations of direct-form IIR filters","sourcePdf":"00659455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047341S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"69","articleId":"659455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":659459,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiang-Ling Li","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Hsiang-Ling Li","id":"37067564600"},{"name":"C.

In practical applications, these cross correlations are usually unknown. Therefore, it is useful for design purposes to find the extreme values of the performance measures over all possible cross correlations. The paper derives, for each one of the above five algorithms, the conditions of target weight cross correlations that maximize and the ones that minimize the steady-state excess mean-square error /spl xi/ and the steady-state mean-square weight misalignment /spl eta/. The relationship between the step sizes /spl mu//sub /spl xi// and /spl mu//sub /spl eta// that minimize /spl xi/ and /spl eta/, respectively, for given target weight cross correlations is studied. Maxima and minima of /spl mu//sub /spl xi// and /spl mu//sub /spl eta// over all target weight cross correlations are found. The necessary and sufficient condition of equality of /spl mu//sub /spl xi// and /spl mu//sub /spl eta// for all target weight cross correlations is derived. A rule that maps the tracking performance measures of the LMS algorithm to the ones of the RLS algorithm is found. The necessary and sufficient condition of equality of the tracking capabilities of the RLS and LMS algorithms for all target weight cross correlations is derived. A measure of the degree of ambiguity of the tracking performance, due to ignorance of target weight cross correlations, is defined. It is found that all of the above algorithms share the same degree of ambiguity, and that this degree increases with the eigenvalue spread of the input covariance matrix.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.659463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/14373/00659463.pdf","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum and minimum tracking performances of adaptive filtering algorithms over target weight cross correlations","doi":"10.1109/82.659463","startPage":"123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Maximum and minimum tracking performances of adaptive filtering algorithms over target weight cross correlations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659463/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5833962","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum and minimum tracking performances of adaptive filtering algorithms over target weight cross correlations","sourcePdf":"00659463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031362S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"10","articleId":"659463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":659466,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

Sayood and Borkenhagen (1991) and Phamdo and Farvardin (see IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.40, p.186-93, 1994) proposed \"detectors\" at the decoder which optimize suitable criteria in order to estimate the sequence of transmitted symbols. Phamdo and Farvardin also proposed an instantaneous approximate minimum mean-squared error (IAMMSE) decoder. These methods provide a performance advantage over conventional systems, but the maximum a posteriori (MAP) structure is suboptimal, while the IAMMSE decoder makes limited use of the redundancy. Alternatively, combining aspects of both approaches, we propose a sequence-based approximate MMSE (SAMMSE) decoder. For a Markovian sequence of encoder-produced symbols and a discrete memoryless channel, we approximate the expected distortion at the decoder under the constraint of fixed decoder complexity. For this simplified cost, the optimal decoder computes expected values based on a discrete hidden Markov model, using the wellknown forward/backward (F/B) algorithm. Performance gains for this scheme are demonstrated over previous techniques in quantizing Gauss-Markov sources over a range of noisy channel conditions. Moreover, a constrained delay version is also suggested.","doi":"10.1109/26.659481","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"222","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14382/00659481.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.659481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sequence-based approximate MMSE decoder for source coding over noisy channels using discrete hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Source coding","Channel coding","Hidden Markov models","Performance loss","Vector quantization","Table lookup","Redundancy","Memoryless systems","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","channel coding","least mean squares methods","sequential decoding","noise","hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood decoding","vector quantisation","rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequence-based approximate MMSE decoder","source coding","noisy channels","discrete hidden Markov models","residual redundancy","quantizer performance","instantaneous approximate MMSE decoder","suboptimal maximum a posteriori structure","Markovian sequence","encoder-produced symbols","discrete memoryless channel","distortion","fixed decoder complexity","forward/backward algorithm","performance gains","Gauss-Markov source quantization","noisy channel","constrained delay","VQ","channel coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"A sequence-based approximate MMSE decoder for source coding over noisy channels using discrete hidden Markov models","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5859477","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659481/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequence-based approximate MMSE decoder for source coding over noisy channels using discrete hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00659481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050671S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"42","articleId":"659481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":659483,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The system design is based on the joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver in a synchronous multiuser channel characterized by multipath propagation. Joint optimization is represented by a linear transformation of the transmitted signals at the transmitter and a linear transformation of received signals at each receiving site that minimize the effect of multiple access and multipath interference. The minimum mean squared error between the true bit value and its estimate at the output of the receiver is taken as the cost function, subject to average and peak transmit power constraints. It is shown that joint transmitter-receiver optimization outperforms significantly either transmitter optimization or receiver-based techniques. The crucial assumption, in the case of multipath channels, is that the transmitter knows the multipath characteristics of all channels and that the channel dynamics are sufficiently slow so that multipath profiles remain essentially constant over a block of preceded bits. The practical applications can be found in indoor and cellular communications, satellite communications, or military communications where nonorthogonal signature waveforms are employed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14382/00659485.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.659485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.659485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint transmitter-receiver optimization in synchronous multiuser communications over multipath channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Filters","Multipath channels","Multiuser channels","Multiuser detection","Design optimization","Military communication","Wireless communication","Fading","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","synchronisation","optimisation","radio transmitters","radio receivers","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","multi-access systems","radiowave propagation","least mean squares methods","indoor radio","cellular radio","satellite communication","military communication","fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint transmitter-receiver optimization","synchronous multiuser communications","multipath channels","interference suppression","multiple access channels","synchronous multiuser channel","multipath propagation","linear transformation","transmitted signals","received signals","multipath interference","multiple access interference","minimum mean squared error","cost function","average transmit power constraint","peak transmit power constraint","channel dynamics","multipath profiles","cellular communications","indoor communications","satellite communications","military communications","nonorthogonal signature waveforms","AWGN channels","fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Joint transmitter-receiver optimization in synchronous multiuser communications over multipath channels","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5859481","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint transmitter-receiver optimization in synchronous multiuser communications over multipath channels","sourcePdf":"00659485.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096501S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"66","articleId":"659485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":659486,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.K.

Until recently, matrix-based processing techniques, such as adaptive and synthetic-aperture processing, could not be efficiently implemented in the current type of sonar systems, even though it is widely believed that they have advantages that can address the requirements associated with the difficult operational problems that next-generation sonars will have to solve. Interestingly, adaptive and synthetic-aperture techniques may be viewed by other disciplines as conventional schemes. For the sonar technology discipline, however, they are considered as advanced schemes because of the very limited progress that has been made in their implementation in sonar systems. This paper is intended to address issues of implementation of advanced processing schemes in sonar systems and also to serve as a brief overview to the principles and applications of advanced sonar signal processing. The main development reported in this paper deals with the definition of a generic beam-forming structure that allows the implementation of nonconventional signal-processing techniques in integrated active-passive sonar systems. These schemes are adaptive and synthetic-aperture beam formers that have been shown experimentally to provide improvements in array gain for signals embedded in partially correlated noise fields. Using target tracking and localization results as performance criteria, the impact and merits of these techniques are contrasted with those obtained using the conventional beam former.","doi":"10.1109/5.659491","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/14381/00659491.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.659491","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"358","endPage":"398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of adaptive and synthetic-aperture processing schemes in integrated active-passive sonar systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659491","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of adaptive and synthetic-aperture processing schemes in integrated active-passive sonar systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659491/","volume":"86","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5847645","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of adaptive and synthetic-aperture processing schemes in integrated active-passive sonar systems","sourcePdf":"00659491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020413S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"37","articleId":"659491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":659495,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

Two data models are described: one that uses the target direction of arrival and signal amplitude as parameters and one that is a simpler, unstructured model that uses a generic target \"spatial signature\". An extended invariance principle is invoked to show how the less accurate maximum likelihood estimates obtained from the simple model may be refined to achieve asymptotically the performance available using the structured model. The resulting algorithm requires two one-dimensional (1-D) searches rather than a two-dimensional search, as with previous approaches for the structured case. If a uniform linear array is used, only a single 1-D search is needed. A generalized likelihood ratio test for target detection is also derived under the unstructured model. The principal advantage of this approach is that it is computationally simple and robust to errors in the model (calibration) of the array response.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14381","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/14381/00659495.pdf","doi":"10.1109/5.659495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.659495","startPage":"421","endPage":"441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood methods in radar array signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659495/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood methods in radar array signal processing","isJournal":true,"volume":"86","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5847647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood methods in radar array signal processing","sourcePdf":"00659495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05269S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"167","articleId":"659495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":659500,"authors":[{"name":"S.F.

Among different assembly approaches, thermosonic bonding is becoming an attractive choice because it is cost-effective. To increase the bonding capability for high input/output (I/O) assembly, a novel longitudinal bonding system was developed in this study. This bonding system has two advantages over the transverse bonding system: it overcomes the planarity problem and simplifies bonding tool configuration. During the development, an end-effector was designed with rigorous considerations of ultrasonic wave propagation, bonding force and co-planarity between the chip holder and hot stage. The bonding system was then characterized to make sure that it is suitable for flip-chip assembly. This bonding technology was proven successful by mechanical bonding tests as well as a functional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor/static random access memory (CMOS/SRAM) module demonstration.

By utilizing the analytic properties of the scattering parameters, the algorithm efficiently generates multiport pole-residue models. The models are combined with the lumped/distributed components for direct time- or frequency-domain simulations. The method can easily be implemented into conventional simulators such as simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) and advanced statistical analysis program (ASTAP) or reduced-order modeling techniques such as asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE), complex frequency hopping (CFH), and Padd approximation via Lancros Process (PVL) for transient simulation of high-speed interconnect networks.

It is found that the ray solution can deterministically predict the early-time field build up after the source is switched on, but cannot predict the steady-state fields of high-Q enclosures because of the intractably large number of ray reflections required for convergence. However, it is demonstrated that the steady-state Q factor may be predicted from the early-time energy density build up at a point by coherently summing the power in each ray. The Q factor is obtained via its relationship to the cavity time constant, which may be extracted from the early time energy density curve. A clear indication of polarization diversity throughout the enclosure may also be obtained by plotting the polarization components of the early-time fields and energy density build up at different points.

Techniques for predicting equivalent OATS radiated fields from measurements in a GTEM have been developed. The techniques include the assumption that the dipole moments, which represent the radiation of an EUT, are all in phase. We analyze the case where the EUT dipole moments are not in phase and propose a new upper limit for the predicted OATS radiated field.

Since the low-frequency mode often has a higher pain, the usually preferred high-frequency mode is suppressed as a result of mode competition. In this paper, possible control of this mode competition is considered using a nonstandard wiggler magnet consisting of two cascaded wiggler sections with different periods and field strengths. It is demonstrated that with an appropriate differentiation between the two wiggler sections the high-frequency mode may be amplified preferentially. This mode-selective amplification may be used to suppress the low-frequency mode. A small signal gain formulation is developed for a waveguide FEL with such a two-sectioned wiggler arrangement and numerical examples are used to demonstrate its applicability to mode control in waveguide FELs. Effects of wiggler field errors and electron energy spread are also considered. It is shown that the requirement for wiggler field errors and electron energy spread in the two-sectioned wiggler arrangement is similar to that in the usual straight wiggler configuration.","doi":"10.1109/27.659536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.659536","startPage":"85","endPage":"91","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/27/14378/00659536.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode-selective amplification in a waveguide free electron laser with a two-sectioned wiggler","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Mode-selective amplification in a waveguide free electron laser with a two-sectioned wiggler","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5859487","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659536/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode-selective amplification in a waveguide free electron laser with a two-sectioned wiggler","sourcePdf":"00659536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04638S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"8","articleId":"659536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":659549,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One of the main problems for the quantitative determination of concentration was absorption of the stimulating synchrotron ray as well as re-absorption of the emitted fluorescent light. The absorption coefficients required for a consideration of the absorption processes have been determined with two absorption tomograms. The algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and the maximum likelihood method with expectation maximization (MLEM) were used for the reconstruction of the chemical element to be classified, with close consideration of the absorption phenomenon. The experiments were undertaken at the bending-magnet beamline, CEMO, at the laboratory for synchrotron radiation in Hamburg, HASYLAB (4.5 GeV) (100 mA). The photon intensity flux was approximately 10/sup 9/ photons/mm/sup 2//s. The concentration of iodine was calculated with phantoms and an untreated, dissected human thyroid gland with the help of a calibration curve.

This uncertainty about the actual state of a network component arises naturally in a number of different environments, which are reviewed in the paper. The goal of the route selection process is then to identify a path that is most likely to satisfy the QoS requirements. For end to end delay guarantees, this problem is intractable. However we show that by decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local delay constraints, efficient and tractable solutions can be established. We first consider the simpler problem of decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local constraints, for a given path. We show that, for general distributions, this problem is also intractable. Nonetheless, by defining a certain class of probability distributions, which posses a certain convexity property, and restricting ourselves to that class, we are able to establish efficient and exact solutions. Moreover, we show that typical distributions would belong to that class. We then consider the general problem, of combined path optimization and delay decomposition. We present an efficient solution scheme for the above class of probability distributions. Our solution is similar to that of the restricted shortest-path problem, which renders itself to near-optimal approximations of polynomial complexity. We also show that yet simpler solutions exist in the special case of uniform distributions.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1998.659631","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

First, we focus on networks which employ rate-based schedulers and hence map delay guarantees into nodal rate guarantees, as done with the guaranteed service class proposed for the Internet. We consider first the basic problem of identifying a feasible route for the connection, for which a straightforward, yet computationally costly solution exists. Accordingly, we establish several /spl epsiv/-optimal solutions that offer substantially lower computational complexity. We then consider the more general problem of optimizing the route choice in terms of balancing loads and accommodating multiple connections, for which we formulate and validate several optimal algorithms. We discuss the implementation of such schemes in the context of link-state and distance-vector protocols. Next, we consider the fundamental problem of constrained path optimization. This problem, typical of QoS routing, is NP-hard. While standard approximation methods exist, their complexity may often be prohibitive in terms of scalability. Such approximations do not make use of the particular properties of large-scale networks, such as the fact that the path selection process is typically presented with a hierarchical, aggregated topology. By exploiting the structure of such topologies, we obtain an /spl epsiv/-optimal algorithm for the constrained shortest path problem, which offers a substantial improvement in terms of scalability.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1998.659634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14409","startPage":"27","endPage":"34 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel4/5315/14409/00659634.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

This paper focuses on the efficiency of the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless LANs. Specifically, we derive an analytical formula for the protocol capacity. From this analysis we found (i) the theoretical upper bound of the IEEE 802.11 protocol capacity; (ii) that the standard can operate very far from the theoretical limits depending on the network configuration; (iii) that an appropriate tuning of the backoff algorithm can drive the IEEE 802.11 protocol close to its theoretical limits. Hence we propose a distributed algorithm which enables each station to tune its backoff algorithm at run-time. The performances of the IEEE 802.11 protocol, enhanced with our algorithm, are investigated via simulation. The results indicate that the enhanced protocol is very close to the maximum theoretical efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1998.659648","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Conservation of battery power has been addressed using many techniques. This paper addresses energy efficiency in medium access control (MAC) protocols for wireless networks. The paper develops a framework to study the energy consumption of a MAC protocol from the transceiver usage perspective. This framework is then applied to compare the performance of a set of protocols that includes IEEE 802.11, energy-conserving MAC (EC-MAC), PRMA, multiservices dynamic reservation-TDMA (MDR-TDMA), and distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA). The performance metrics considered are transmitter and receiver usage times for packet transmission and reception. The analysis here shows that protocols that aim to reduce the number of contentions perform better from a energy consumption perspective. The receiver usage time, however; tends to be higher for protocols that require the mobile to sense the medium before attempting transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Mar-2 Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659649/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5998738","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of MAC protocols for wireless local networks based on battery power consumption","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of MAC protocols for wireless local networks based on battery power consumption","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00659649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042908S","chronDate":"29 Mar-2 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5315","citationCount":"45","articleId":"659649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":659661,"authors":[{"name":"H.

At the time of operation, this Web server was one of the busiest on the Internet. We first describe the techniques used to gather these traces and reconstruct the behavior of the TCP on the server. We then present a detailed analysis of the TCP's loss recovery and congestion control behavior from the recorded transfers. Our two most important results are: (1) short Web transfers lead to poor loss recovery performance for TCPs, and (2) concurrent connections are overly aggressive users of the network. We then discuss techniques designed to solve these problems. To improve the data-driven loss recovery performance of short transfers, we present a new enhancement to the TCP's loss recovery. To improve the congestion control and loss recovery performance of parallel TCP connections, we present a new integrated approach to congestion control and loss recovery that works across the set of concurrent connections. Simulations and trace analysis show that our enhanced loss recovery scheme could have eliminated 25% of all timeout events, and that our integrated approach provides greater fairness and improved startup performance for concurrent connections.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1998.659661","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The passive valves stop the flow of a liquid inside a capillary using a capillary pressure barrier that develops when the channel cross section changes abruptly. Two types of valves with vertical and horizontal neck regions were fabricated yielding pressure barriers ranging from 1-6 kPa. Introducing asymmetry in the neck region, unidirectional valving action was achieved. The passive valving devices were used in combination with two electrodes to implement a sample injector. The injector uses an electrolytically-generated O/sub 2/ bubble that raises the liquid pressure beyond the barrier thus reestablishing flow with as little as 150 /spl mu/W of electrical power.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1998.659727","publicationTitle":"Proceedings MEMS 98.

Analyzing the results, a proposed fabrication process was derived from optimizing the control factors for the best overall mean across all the outputs. The experiment was repeated for three film thicknesses: 50 /spl mu/m, 100 /spl mu/m,and 220 /spl mu/m. The desired output characteristics were straight sidewall profile, fine line and space resolution, and adhesion to substrate. Tables show optimized processing parameters for these three film thicknesses.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings MEMS 98. IEEE.

The micropump is based on a piezoelectrically driven diaphragm actuator, which is combined with a valve unit consisting of two cantilever valves. The self-priming and bubble-tolerant operation mode was achieved by maximizing the compression ratio, which was realized by minimizing the dead volume of the valve unit as well as of the actuator unit and by maximizing the stroke volume of the pump diaphragm. The optimization of the actuator is based on simulations and experimental investigations of the pump diaphragm displacement. These studies yield the optimal dimensions of the pump diaphragm and the piezoactuator. The piezoelectrically actuated micropump was characterized by investigating the pump rate in dependence of the actuation frequency and the pressure on the inlet and the outlet port of the micropump. As essential results a maximum pumprate of 1 mY/min and a maximum backpressure of about I bar were measured for water. For gases the pumprate ranges up to 3 ml/min.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1998.659814","publicationTitle":"Proceedings MEMS 98. IEEE.

Such steps include membrane formation and cavity sealing under vacuum. Three transducer membrane structures are evaluated: a nitride membrane with an LTO sacrificial layer; a polysilicon membrane with an LTO sacrificial layer; and a nitride membrane with a polysilicon sacrificial layer. The major differences in the three processes are the conductivity, dielectric constant and residual stress of the membrane. Three vacuum sealing mechanisms are compared, each of which requires a different degree of lithographic sophistication, and results in a sealed cavity. Submicron via sealing requires sophisticated lithography, but is amenable to LPCVD nitride, LTO and other sealing procedures. Standard g-line lithography results in vias which seal only with high sticking coefficient species, such as LTO. A novel etch channel structure, which results in lateral sealing and requires neither sophisticated lithography nor a particular sealing is demonstrated. The experiments in the paper are guided by theoretical analysis and computer simulations when applicable. The optimized process based on a nitride membrane with a polysilicon sacrificial layer results in devices which have a broad band 50 /spl Omega/ real part impedance in the megahertz range. In addition, a transducer dynamic range in excess of 100 dB is achieved with an untuned bandwidth of 50%. The fabrication techniques and results herein reported indicate that surface micromachined capacitive ultrasonic transducers are an alternative to piezoelectric transducers in immersion applications.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1998.659834","publicationTitle":"Proceedings MEMS 98.

The approach is based on determination of the set of nodes (called stations) in the hypercube such that for any node in the network there is a station at distance of at most 1. Once stations are identified, parallel disjoint paths are formed from the source to all stations. The broadcasting is accomplished first by sending the message to all stations which will in turn inform the rest of the nodes of the message. To establish node-disjoint paths between the source node and all stations, we introduce a new routing strategy. We prove that multicasting can be done in one routing step as long as the number of destination nodes are fewer than or equal to n in an n-dimensional hypercube. The number of broadcasting steps using our routing is equal to or smaller than that obtained in an earlier work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near optimal broadcast in all-port wormhole routed hypercubes using error correcting codes","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1998.659881","startPage":"8","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.1998.659881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14421","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference.

The distributed sorting problem can be informally described as follows: nodes cooperate to reach a global configuration where every node, depending on its identifier, is assigned a specific final value taken from a set of input values distributed across all nodes; the input values may change in time. In our solution, the system reaches its final configuration in a finite time after the input values are stable and the faults cease. The fault tolerance and adaption to changing input are achieved using Dijkstra's paradigm of self stabilization. Our solution is based on continuous broadcast with acknowledgment along the tree network to achieve synchronization among processes in the system; it has O(nh) time complexity and only O(log(n)deg) memory requirement where deg is the degree of the tree and h is the height of the tree.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fault-tolerant distributed sorting algorithm in tree networks","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference.

In contrast, the algorithm proposed in this paper uses an explicit model for lines and their surroundings. By analyzing the scale-space behavior of a model line profile, it is shown how the bias that is induced by asymmetrical lines can be removed. Furthermore, the algorithm not only returns the precise subpixel line position, but also the width of the line for each line point, also with subpixel accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unbiased detector of curvilinear structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.659930","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/14411/00659930.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.659930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14411","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"An unbiased detector of curvilinear structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5873752","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unbiased detector of curvilinear structures","sourcePdf":"00659930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036332S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"704","articleId":"659930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":659933,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We first discuss a limitation of the image blurring model using the convolution, and then present an optical flux based blurring model named the reversed projection blurring (RPB) model. Unlike the multicomponent blurring model proposed by Nguyen et al., the RPB model enables us to explore the optical phenomena caused by a shift-variant point spread function that appears at a depth discontinuity. Using the RPB model, theoretical analysis of occluding edge properties are given and two characteristic phenomena are shown: (1) a blurred occluding edge produces the same brightness profiles as would be predicted for a surface edge on the occluding object when the occluded surface radiance is uniform and (2) a nonmonotonic brightness transition would be observed in blurred occluding edge profiles when the occluded object has a surface edge. Experimental results using real images have demonstrated the validity of the RPB model as well as the observability of the characteristic phenomena of blurred occluding edges.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/14411/00659933.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.659933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.659933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14411","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=659933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of photometric properties of occluding edges by the reversed projection blurring model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Photometry","Image edge detection","Convolution","Focusing","Optical variables control","Brightness","Computer Society","Image analysis","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photometry","image segmentation","edge detection","convolution","optical transfer function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photometric properties","occluding edges","reversed projection blurring model","image blurring model","convolution","optical flux based blurring model","multicomponent blurring model","RPB model","optical phenomena","shift-variant point spread function","depth discontinuity","occluding edge properties","blurred occluding edge","brightness profiles","uniform occluded surface radiance","nonmonotonic brightness transition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/659933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of photometric properties of occluding edges by the reversed projection blurring model","volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5873755","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of photometric properties of occluding edges by the reversed projection blurring model","sourcePdf":"00659933.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038638S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"14411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"44","articleId":"659933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":659942,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Lei","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Zhibin Lei","id":"37350769300"},{"name":"D.B.

From this study, we identify loop tuning opportunities to bridge the gap between \"best-case\" and \"actual\" performance in a post-silicon setting. Some of the results of such analysis point to fundamental hardware performance bugs which may be removed through feasible microarchitectural changes. More frequently, the analysis is useful for suggesting compiler enhancements. The analysis methods described have been used in actual high-end processor development projects within our company.
