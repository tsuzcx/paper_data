The Darlington cascode achieves 12.5 dB gain with a 16 GHz 3-dB BW - a 60% BW improvement over the conventional Darlington. The DCAS obtains an IP3 of 29 dBm with a 13 GHz BW - an 80% improvement in IP3-BW over the conventional Darlington approach.

Modern application requirements and size limitations have driven industry leaders towards the co-integration of depletion mode n-FET and GaAs HBT. The merger of bipolar and FET, or BiFET, gives an additional degree of freedom in the design of advanced power amplifiers independent of a silicon controller. This paper provides an overview of the various techniques that can be used to merge the two device technologies and then show how a merged epitaxial structure, where a FET is formed in the emitter layers of an HBT, combines functional versatility with the high volume manufacturability needed to supply millions of power amplifiers at low cost. Specific handset applications that can benefit or be enabled by BiFET are presented, such as auto-bias power amplifiers, advanced bias control with low or no voltage reference, on-chip power detectors, and integrated operational amplifiers. When npn-only bias circuitry is limited to low voltage reference levels, HBT power amplifiers with BiFET bias stages are shown to have superior RF performance to their npn-only counterparts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Telephone sets","Power amplifiers","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Radiofrequency amplifiers","FETs","Operational amplifiers","Low voltage","Corporate acquisitions","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","microwave power amplifiers","mobile handsets","operational amplifiers","Schottky gate field effect transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["merged HBT-FET","BiFET","wireless handset power amplifiers","size limitations","depletion mode n-FET","silicon controller","epitaxial structure","auto-bias power amplifiers","on-chip power detectors","integrated operational amplifiers","BiCMOS integrated circuits","heterojunction bipolar transistors","JFET","MESFET","microwave power amplifiers","semiconductor epitaxial layers","InGaP-GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","FETs","Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors","JFETs","MESFETs","microwave power amplifiers","semiconductor epitaxial layers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2006.319890","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4109951/4109952/04110012.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4109952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2006.319890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An InGaP/GaAs Merged HBT-FET (BiFET) Technology and Applications to the Design of Handset Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An InGaP/GaAs Merged HBT-FET (BiFET) Technology and Applications to the Design of Handset Power Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110012/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110012/","accessionNumber":"9297688","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An InGaP/GaAs Merged HBT-FET (BiFET) Technology and Applications to the Design of Handset Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"CSICS-00-60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059343S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4109951","isNumber":"4109952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4109951","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4109952","articleId":"4110012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4110018,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Dehlink","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Dehlink","id":"37301366700"},{"name":"Hans-dieter Wohlmuth","affiliation":["Frequentis GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Hans-dieter","lastName":"Wohlmuth","id":"37274554800"},{"name":"Klaus Aufinger","affiliation":["Lnfineon AG, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Aufinger","id":"37284137300"},{"name":"Franz Weiss","affiliation":["Qimonda AG, Neubiberg, Germany","University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37295349100"},{"name":"Arpad L.

Defining the appropriate coverage points that capture the design's functionalities is a non-trivial problem. However, the real bottleneck remains in generating the suitable testbenches that activate those coverage points adequately. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance the coverage rate of multiple coverage points through the automatic generation of appropriate test patterns. We employ a directed random simulation, where directives are continuously updated until achieving acceptable coverage rates for all coverage points. We propose to model the solution of the test generation problem as sequences of directives or cells, each of them with specific width, height and distribution. Our approach is based on a genetic algorithm, which automatically optimizes the widths, heights and distributions of these cells over the whole input domain with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of test generation.

Much research has focused on the modeling of spatial correlation in SSTA. However, the vast majority of these works used artificially generated process data to test the proposed models. Hence, it is difficult to determine the actual effectiveness of these methods, the conditions under which they are necessary, and whether they lead to a significant increase in accuracy that warrants their increased runtime and complexity. In this paper, we study 5 different correlation models and their associated SSTA methods using 35420 critical dimension (CD) measurements that were extracted from 23 reticles on 5 wafers in a 130nm CMOS process. Based on the measured CD data, we analyze the correlation as a function of distance and generate 5 distinct correlation models, ranging from simple models which incorporate one or two variation components to more complex models that utilize principle component analysis and quad-trees. We then study the accuracy of the different models and compare their SSTA results with the result of running STA directly on the extracted data. We also examine the trade-off between model accuracy and run time, as well as the impact of die size on model accuracy. We show that, especially for small dies (6.6mm times 5.7mm), the simple models provide comparable accuracy to that of the more complex ones, while incurring significantly less runtime and implementation difficulty. The results of this study demonstrate that correlation models for SSTA must be carefully tested on actual process data and must be used judiciously","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4110154/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9442198","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Modeling of CD Variation for Statistical Static Timing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Modeling of CD Variation for Statistical Static Timing","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056181S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110165,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon R.

The additional force which distributes the modules on the chip in force-directed quadratic placement is separated into two forces: hold force and move force. Both of these forces are determined without any heuristics. Based on this novel systematic force implementation, we show that our iterative placement algorithm converges to an overlap-free placement. In addition, engineering change order (ECO) is efficiently supported by our placer. To handle the important trade-off between CPU time and placement quality, a deterministic quality control is presented. In addition, a new linear net model is proposed, which accurately models the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) in the quadratic cost function of quadratic placement. HPWL in general is a linear metric for netlength and represents an efficient and common estimation for routed wirelength. Compared with the classical clique net model, our linear net model reduces memory usage by 75%, CPU time by 23% and netlength by 8%, which is measured by the HPWL of all nets. Using the ISPD-2005 benchmark suite for comparison, our placer combined with the new linear net model has just 5.9% higher netlength but is 16times faster than APlace, which offers the best netlength in this benchmark. Compared to Capo, our placer has 9.2% lower netlength and is 5.4times faster. In the recent ISPD-2006 placement contest, in which quality is mainly determined by netlength and CPU time, our placer together with the new net model produced excellent results","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320083","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110094/4110095/04110171.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Robust Quadratic Placement Combined with an Exact Linear Net Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Robust Quadratic Placement Combined with an Exact Linear Net Model","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9442215","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110171/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110171/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Robust Quadratic Placement Combined with an Exact Linear Net Model","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064556S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4110172,"authors":[{"name":"Tung-chieh Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tung-chieh","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290413600"},{"name":"Zhe-wei Jiang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhe-wei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37292434600"},{"name":"Tien-chang Hsu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tien-chang","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37289654800"},{"name":"Hsin-chen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37066810700"},{"name":"Yao-wen Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279580700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-389-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4110172","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110172","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["White spaces","Smoothing methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Sliding mode control","Gradient methods","Routing","Minimization methods","Runtime","Law","Legal factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-quality mixed-size analytical placer","preplaced blocks","density constraints","high-quality analytical placement algorithm","log-sum-exp wirelength model","two-stage smoothing technique","Gaussian smoothing","block spreading","white-space reallocation","cut-line shifting","cell sliding","global placement"]}],"abstract":"In addition to wirelength, modern placers need to consider various constraints such as preplaced blocks and density.

The density is controlled by white-space re-allocation using partitioning and cut-line shifting during global placement and cell sliding during detailed placement.

The test cost of such devices is an appreciable percentage of the overall cost, which typically results from the high number of specifications, the high number of distinct test set-ups and equipment pieces that need to be used, and the high cost of each test set-up. In this paper, we investigate the versatility of EVM measurements to test the variable-envelope WLAN (wireless local area networks) receiver and transmitter characteristics. The goal is to optimize EVM test parameters (input data and test limits) and to reduce the number of specification measurements that require high test times and/or expensive test equipment.

Modern FPGA soft-cores are parameterized to support application-specific customization, wherein pre-defined units, such as a multiplication unit or floating-point unit, may be included in the microprocessor architecture to speed up software execution at the expense of increased size. We introduce a methodology for fast application-specific customization of a parameterized FPGA soft core, using synthesis and execution to obtain size and performance data in order to create a tool that can be used across a variety of tool platforms and FPGA devices. As synthesizing a soft core takes tens of minutes, developing heuristics that execute in an acceptable time of an hour or two, yet find near-optimal results, is a challenge. We consider two approaches, one using a traditional CAD approach that does an initial characterization using synthesis to create an abstract problem model and then explores the solution space using a knapsack algorithm, and the other using a synthesis-in-the-loop exploration approach. We compare approaches for a variety of design constraints, on 11 EEMBC benchmarks, using an actual Xilinx soft-core processor, and for two different commercial Xilinx FPGA devices. Our results show that the approaches can generate a customized configuration exhibiting roughly 2x speedups over a base soft core, reaching within 4% of optimal in about 1.5 hours, including complete synthesis of the soft-core onto the FPGA, compared to over 11 hours for exhaustive search. Our results also show that including synthesis-in-the-loop, compared to a traditional CAD approach, improved speedups by an average of 20% when size constraints were tight. The approaches may also be applicable to soft-core processors targeted to ASICs in addition to FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110094/4110095/04110184.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-Specific Customization of Parameterized FPGA Soft-Core Processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Microprocessors","Application specific processors","Computer science","Space exploration","Permission","Logic arrays","Fabrics","Application specific integrated circuits","Embedded software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA soft-core processor","field-programmable gate array","microprocessor architecture","application-specific customization","CAD","knapsack algorithm","synthesis-in-the-loop exploration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tuning","customization","FPGA","soft-core processors","parameterized platforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Application-Specific Customization of Parameterized FPGA Soft-Core Processors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9442228","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Specific Customization of Parameterized FPGA Soft-Core Processors","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054224S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110188,"authors":[{"name":"Gennette Gill","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Gennette","lastName":"Gill","id":"37294924700"},{"name":"John Hansen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Hansen","id":"37286135600"},{"name":"Montek Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Montek","lastName":"Singh","id":"37280903400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-389-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4110188","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Streaming media","Throughput","Iterative algorithms","Hardware","Computer architecture","Concurrent computing","Cryptography","Iterative methods","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing","program control structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loop pipelining","stream processing architecture","self-timed pipelined ring"]}],"abstract":"We present a technique for increasing the throughput of stream processing architectures by removing the bottlenecks caused by loop structures.

The results allow predicting the transient error susceptibility of an SRAM cell using a closed-form expression. The key innovation involves using the methods of nonlinear system theory in developing the model. It is shown that when a transient noise of given magnitude affects a sensitive node of a cell, the bi-stable, feedback-driven nature of the cell determines whether the noise will be suppressed or will evolve to eventually flip state. The specific formal and quantitative result is a closed-form expression that can be used to predict whether a cell flip will occur for a noise signal with specific characteristics, and for a given SRAM cell design. Experiments show excellent match between the analytical prediction and the SPICE simulation results","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320052","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110094/4110095/04110192.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Modeling of SRAM Dynamic Stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Modeling of SRAM Dynamic Stability","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9442236","htmlLink":"/document/4110192/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Modeling of SRAM Dynamic Stability","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065498S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110198,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivasan Murali","affiliation":["CSL, University of Stanford, Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Murali","id":"37274207100"},{"name":"Paolo Meloni","affiliation":["DIEE, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Meloni","id":"37299748200"},{"name":"Federico Angiolini","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Angiolini","id":"37299750100"},{"name":"David Atienza","affiliation":["DACYA, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain","EPFL, LSI, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Atienza","id":"37275656500"},{"name":"Salvatore Carta","affiliation":["DMI, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Carta","id":"37299745800"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"},{"name":"Giovanni De Micheli","affiliation":["EPFL, LSI, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"De Micheli","id":"37274174300"},{"name":"Luigi Raffo","affiliation":["DIEE, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Raffo","id":"37299746700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-389-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4110198","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":588},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Design methodology","Network synthesis","Timing","Network topology","System-on-a-chip","Wiring","System recovery","Routing","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout","network-on-chip","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-specific networks on chips","floorplan information","communication demands","systems on chips","scalable networks on chips","topology synthesis","network power consumption","mesh-based custom topologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks on chips","deadlock-free routing","topology","floorplan"]}],"abstract":"With increasing communication demands of processor and memory cores in systems on chips (SoCs), scalable networks on chips (NoCs) are needed to interconnect the cores. For the use of NoCs to be feasible in today's industrial designs, a custom-tailored, application-specific NoC that satisfies the design objectives and constraints of the targeted application domain is required. In this work, we present a design methodology that automates the synthesis of such application-specific NoC architectures. We present a floorplan aware design method that considers the wiring complexity of the NoC during the topology synthesis process. This leads to detecting timing violations on the NoC links early in the design cycle and to have accurate power estimations of the interconnect. We incorporate mechanisms to prevent deadlocks during routing, which is critical for proper operation of NoCs. We integrate the NoC synthesis method with an existing design flow, automating NoC synthesis, generation, simulation and physical design processes. We also present ways to ensure design convergence across the levels. Experiments on several SoC benchmarks are presented, which show that the synthesized topologies provide a large reduction in network power consumption (2.78 times on average) and improvement in performance (1.59 times on average) over the best mesh and mesh-based custom topologies. An actual layout of a multimedia SoC with the NoC designed using our methodology is presented, which shows that the designed NoC supports the required frequency of operation (close to 900 MHz) without any timing violations.

In this paper, we propose a unified post-litho device characterization model and circuit simulation for timing and power. To our best knowledge, this is the most accurate methodology for post-litho analysis, including timing, leakage and transient simulation.

In this work, we address the creation of a resource efficient sensor infrastructure for computing systems that are of regular nature, such as logic array-based computing platforms. We propose algorithms to embed thermal sensors into a regular structure to minimize the number of sensors and determine sensor locations required to maintain a given accuracy in temperature sensing for a given design. Our algorithms are tailored for minimal usage of thermal sensors to suit a variety of architectural conditions. For programmable logic arrays the highly application-specific usage of the hardware resources leads to unpredictable thermal profiles. As a result, post-manufacture instantiation of thermal sensors is desired, which in turn demands the use of native hardware resources, which can be scarce.

In this paper, we first estimate the temperature distribution within a Virtex-4 FPGA by feeding the block power numbers in an architecture-level temperature simulator calibrated to reflect a real FPGA package. We analyze the impact of different hard-wired blocks on the temperature profile, and observe that they introduce intra-die variation in temperature of up to 20degC.

To get accurate interconnect information during the placement process, it is desirable to incorporate global routing into it. However, previous global routers are computationally expensive. It is impractical to perform global routing repeatedly during placement. In this paper, we present an extremely fast and high-quality global router called FastRoute. In traditional global routing approaches, congestion is not considered during Steiner tree construction. So they have to rely on the time-consuming maze routing technique to eliminate routing congestion. Different from traditional approaches, we proposed a congestion-driven Steiner tree topology generation technique and an edge shifting technique to determine the good Steiner tree topologies and Steiner node positions. Based on the congestion-driven Steiner trees, we only need to apply maze routing to a small percentage of the two-pin nets once to obtain high quality global routing solutions. We also proposed a new cost function based on logistic function to direct the maze routing. Experimental results show that FastRoute generates less congested solutions in 132times and 64times faster runtimes than the state-of-the-art academic global routers Labyrinth (R. Kastner et al, 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (R. T. Hadsell and P. H. Madden, 2003), respectively. It is even faster than the highly-efficient congestion estimator FaDGloR (J. Westra and P.

With continued scaling, the effect of NBTI has rapidly grown in prominence, forcing designers to resort to a pessimistic design style using guard-banding. Since NBTI is strongly dependent on the time for which the PMOS device is stressed, different gates in a combinational circuit experience varying extents of delay degradation. This has necessitated a mechanism of quantizing the gate-delay degradation, to pave the way for improved design strategies. Our work addresses this issue by providing a procedure for determining the amount of delay degradation of a circuit due to NBTI. An analytical model for NBTI is derived using the framework of the reaction-diffusion model, and a mathematical proof for the widely observed phenomenon of frequency independence is provided. Simulations on ISCAS benchmarks under a 70nm technology show that NBTI causes a delay degradation of about 8% in combinational logic based circuits after 10 years (ap 3 times 108s)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4110220/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9442264","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Model for Negative Bias Temperature Instability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Model for Negative Bias Temperature Instability","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061085S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110222,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeev R.

This paper presents novel circuit optimization techniques to mitigate soft error rates (SER) of combinational logic circuits. First, we propose a gate sizing algorithm that trades off SER reduction and area overhead. This approach first computes bounds on the maximum achievable SER reduction by resizing a gate. This bound is then used to prune the circuit graph, arriving at a smaller set of candidate gates on which we perform incremental sensitivity computations to determine the gates that are the largest contributors to circuit SER. Second, we propose a flipflop selection method that uses slack information at each primary output node to determine the flipflop configuration that produces maximum SER savings. This approach uses an enhanced flipflop library that contains flipflops of varying temporal masking ability. Third, we propose a unified, co-optimization approach combining flipflop selection with the gate sizing algorithm. The joint optimization algorithm produces larger SER reductions while incurring smaller circuit overhead than either technique taken in isolation. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show SER reductions of 7.9times with gate sizing, 6.6times with flipflop assignment, and 28.2times for the combined optimization approach, with no delay penalties and area overheads within 5-6%. The runtimes for the optimization algorithms are on the order of 1-3 minutes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9442266","htmlLink":"/document/4110222/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Soft Error Reduction in Combinational Logic Using Gate Resizing and Flipflop Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Error Reduction in Combinational Logic Using Gate Resizing and Flipflop Selection","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082883S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4110224,"authors":[{"name":"Xiliang Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xiliang","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37276292700"},{"name":"Cheng-zhong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-zhong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278305300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-389-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4110224","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Approximation algorithms","Polynomials","Dynamic voltage scaling","Voltage control","Energy consumption","Network interfaces","Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","dynamic programming","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-wide energy consumption minimization","real-time task","dynamic voltage scaling","energy-aware processors","memory subsystem","I/O subsystem","network interface cards","dynamic programming algorithm","pseudopolynomial time","approximation algorithm","optimization","online scheduling","sporadic task","NP-hard"]}],"abstract":"We present a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technique that minimizes system-wide energy consumption for both periodic and sporadic tasks. It is known that a system consists of processors and a number of other components. Energy-aware processors can be run in different speed levels; components like memory and I/O subsystems and network interface cards can be in a standby state when they are active but idle. Processor energy optimization solutions are not necessarily efficient from the perspective of systems. Current system-wide energy optimization studies are often limited to periodic tasks with heuristics in getting approximated solutions. In this paper, we develop an exact dynamic programming algorithm for periodic tasks on processors with practical discrete speed levels. The algorithm determines the lower bound of energy expenditure in pseudo-polynomial time. An approximation algorithm is proposed to provide performance guarantee with a given bound in polynomial running time. Because of their time efficiency, both the optimization and approximation algorithms can be adapted for online scheduling of sporadic tasks with irregular task releases. We prove that system-wide energy optimization for sporadic tasks is NP-hard in the strong sense.

Microprocessor manufacturers are experimenting with tens of cores, forecasting the arrival of hundreds of cores per single processor die in the near future. With such large-scale integration and increasing power densities, thermal management continues to be a significant design effort to maintain performance and reliability in modern process technologies. In this paper, we present two mechanisms to perform frequency scaling as part of dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS) to assist dynamic thermal management (DTM). Our frequency selection algorithms incorporate the physical interaction of the cores on a large-scale system onto the emergency intervention mechanisms for temperature reduction of the hotspot, while aiming to minimize the performance impact of frequency scaling on the core that is in thermal emergency. Our results show that our algorithm consistently succeeds in maximizing the operating frequency of the most critical core while successfully relieving the thermal emergency of the core. A comparison of our two alternative techniques reveals that our physical aware criticality-based algorithm results in 11.7% faster clock frequencies compared to our aggressive scaling algorithm.

The methodology self-consistently incorporates various electrothermal couplings arising mainly due to the strong dependence of subthreshold leakage on temperature and also employs an accurate package thermal model, to account for inhomogeneous layers and non-cubic structure, which are not considered in traditional methods. The proposed methodology becomes increasingly effective as technology scales due to increasing leakage. Furthermore, it is shown that considering realistic package thermal models not only improves the accuracy of estimating temperature distribution but also has significant implications for power estimation and hot-spot management","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320176","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110094/4110095/04110233.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Electrothermally-Aware Full-Chip Substrate Temperature Gradient Evaluation Methodology for Leakage Dominant Technologies with Implications for Power Estimation and Hot-Spot Management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110233/","displayDocTitle":"An Electrothermally-Aware Full-Chip Substrate Temperature Gradient Evaluation Methodology for Leakage Dominant Technologies with Implications for Power Estimation and Hot-Spot Management","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9442277","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110233/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Electrothermally-Aware Full-Chip Substrate Temperature Gradient Evaluation Methodology for Leakage Dominant Technologies with Implications for Power Estimation and Hot-Spot Management","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086282S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110234,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Yang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292959600"},{"name":"Changyun Zhu","affiliation":["ECE Department, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Changyun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37289716100"},{"name":"Zhenyu Gu","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Gu","id":"37291583800"},{"name":"Li Shang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Shang","id":"37286995200"},{"name":"Robert P.

This article describes ISAC, a novel, fast, accurate thermal analysis system for use in IC synthesis and design. We present new, cooperative, temporal and spatial adaptation methods to dramatically accelerate accurate analysis. The proposed system unifies steady-state, time-domain, and frequency-domain analysis techniques. It is composed of our spatially-adaptive multigrid iterative solver, a new temporally and spatially adaptive asynchronous time marching solver, and a new spatially-adaptive frequency-domain moment matching solver. Together, these cooperative adaptation and multi-domain analysis techniques allow the proposed system to efficiently solve the static, short time scale, and long time scale variants of the IC thermal analysis problem. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement over existing thermal analysis solutions. Our spatial adaptation techniques bring a 21.6times -690.0times speedup over recently-published steady-state thermal analysis techniques. Our unified spatial and temporal adaptation techniques, within our asynchronous time marching method, bring a 1,071times -1,890times speedup over other widely-used, time-domain thermal analysis techniques with less than 0.5% error. Our spatial adaptation techniques enable the efficient use of our frequency-domain thermal analysis technique, which brings a 10times - 100times speedup over the fastest-known time-domain technique, when used for long time scale thermal analysis.

These problematic layout configurations need to be efficiently detected and eliminated from a design layout to enable better yield. In this paper, such layout configurations are called process-hotspots and an efficient and scalable algorithm is proposed to detect such process-hotspots in a given layout. The concept of a range pattern is introduced and used to accurately and compactly represent these process-hotspots. This representation is flexible and can incorporate information about the deficiencies of available modeling and/or subsequent correction (for instance, mask synthesis) techniques. Each range pattern can also be associated with a scoring mechanism to score the problem regions according to yield impact. A library of range patterns is being developed in collaboration with a fab. The proposed process-hotspot detection system assumes that process-hotspots are specified as a library of range patterns and determines all occurrences of any of these range patterns in a layout. It is fast and accurate and can be applied to large industrial layouts. Unlike previous work, the proposed scheme can identify problems that cannot be efficiently modeled or corrected by subsequent mask synthesis techniques and can thereby complement existing work in that area.

This limited routing capacity creates a hard channel width constraint that can make it difficult for CAD tools to successfully map a circuit into these devices. Instead of migrating a design to a high-cost, resource-rich architecture that is easier to route, we present a cheaper alternative: a fully automated CAD flow (Un/DoPack) that finds local regions of high interconnect demand and reduces it by spreading out the logic in that region. This is done by introducing whitespace in the form of empty logic elements (LEs) within the configurable logic blocks (CLBs) of the congested region. After spreading, the congested region occupies more routing channels and so obtains access to greater aggregate interconnect capacity. Although this has the side effect of using more CLBs, it has the advantage of lowering peak interconnect demands and making a previously-unroutable circuit routable. We also design a new set of synthetic benchmark circuits that model interconnect variation within a large design. Using these benchmarks, we show that circuits with high interconnect variation require FPGA devices to have large channel widths. However, since congestion of such circuits is localized, Un/DoPack is very good at reducing the peak demands of circuits with high interconnect variation. Our results suggest that even for an average Rent exponent of 0.62 (a modest value), a large variation of this exponent within a design will also require FPGAs to have large channel widths. Thus, it is crucial to study interconnect variation of benchmark circuits when designing low-cost FPGAs. Previous research studying interconnect properties focuses on average Rent exponent values of each design, but we believe new work should study variation as well. For circuits with high interconnect variation, we demonstrate that channel widths can be reduced by up to ~40% with only ~10% increase in area","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Un/DoPack: Re-Clustering of Large System-on-Chip Designs with Interconnect Variation for Low-Cost FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320013","startPage":"680","endPage":"687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110095","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110094/4110095/04110252.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Un/DoPack: Re-Clustering of Large System-on-Chip Designs with Interconnect Variation for Low-Cost FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110252/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9442296","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Un/DoPack: Re-Clustering of Large System-on-Chip Designs with Interconnect Variation for Low-Cost FPGAs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCAD-00-157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054593S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110094","isNumber":"4110095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110094","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4110095","articleId":"4110252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110253,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Jia","affiliation":["University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37288915600"},{"name":"Ranga Vemuri","affiliation":["University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Ranga","lastName":"Vemuri","id":"37274865900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-389-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"4110253","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Integrated circuit interconnections","Programmable logic arrays","Design automation","Switches","Clocks","Logic arrays","Routing","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GALS FPGA architecture","Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous FPGA architecture","GAPLA architecture","parameterized automatic design flow","routing delays","CAD flow"]}],"abstract":"Routing delays dominate other delays in current FPGA designs.

Our DRP architecture has a stand alone finite state machine and that switches \"contexts\" consisting of many operational and storage units in processing elements (PEs) and wires between them. Utilizing the resources not only in two spatial dimensions but also vertically (time-multiplexed) under accurate timing and area constraints imposes challenges for a high-level synthesizer for the DRP. We describe a C-based behavioral synthesis method which features datapath generation with clock speed optimization. This is achieved by including the overhead of selectors in the scheduling algorithm, and considering a wire delay at each PE level. A new technique is introduced to achieve high area efficiency. It works by effectively allocating multiple steps into the context. From the original high-level synthesizer for application-specific integrated circuits, some of the basic rules such as operator and register sharing were completely changed due to the coarse grained and multi-context architecture. Experimental results show that the generated data paths are highly parallelized and well balanced between contexts.

Previous studies on routing algorithms focused on networks with a single channel rate. The capability of supporting multiple channel rates, which is common in wireless systems, has not been carefully studied in routing algorithms. In this paper, we first carry out a comprehensive study on the impacts of multiple rates, interference and packet loss rate on the maximum end-to-end throughput or path capacity. A linear programming problem is formulated to determine the path capacity of any given path. This problem is also extended to a joint routing and link scheduling optimization problem to find a path with the largest path capacity. We show that interference clique transmission time is inversely proportional to the upper bound of the path capacity, and hence we propose to use it as a new routing metric. Moreover, we evaluate the capability of various routing metrics such as hop count, expected transmission times, end-to-end transmission delay or medium time, link rate, bandwidth distance product, and interference clique transmission time to discover a high throughput path. The results show that different routing metrics lead to paths with significantly different path capacity, and the interference clique transmission time tends to discover paths with higher throughput than other metrics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2006.320201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110263","startPage":"86","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110262/4110263/04110281.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Routing Metrics on Path Capacity in Multirate and Multihop Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4110281/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Routing Metrics on Path Capacity in Multirate and Multihop Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10222785","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Routing Metrics on Path Capacity in Multirate and Multihop Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081732S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110262","isNumber":"4110263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110262","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4110263","articleId":"4110281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110291,"authors":[{"name":"Mansoor Alicherry","affiliation":["Lucent Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mansoor","lastName":"Alicherry","id":"37282325500"},{"name":"M.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm. We finally present extensive simulation results of network-based virus/worm detection using real signature databases to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Speed Pattern Matching for Network IDS/IPS","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2006.320212","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110262/4110263/04110291.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2006.320212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"High Speed Pattern Matching for Network IDS/IPS","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110291/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10222787","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Speed Pattern Matching for Network IDS/IPS","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07308S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110262","isNumber":"4110263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110262","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4110263","articleId":"4110291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110293,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Tang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37531282600"},{"name":"Himanshu Gupta","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37270217000"},{"name":"Samir Das","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Das","id":"37291449500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0593-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0594-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"4110293","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Approximation algorithms","Distributed algorithms","Mobile ad hoc networks","Delay","Bandwidth","Algorithm design and analysis","Cost function","Polynomials","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","approximation theory","cache storage","computational complexity","distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benefit-based data caching","information access","wireless ad hoc network","distributed caching algorithms","cache placement problem","NP-hard optimization problem","polynomial-time centralized approximation algorithm","network simulator"]}],"abstract":"Data caching can significantly improve the efficiency of information access in a wireless ad hoc network by reducing the access latency and bandwidth usage. However, designing efficient distributed caching algorithms is non-trivial when network nodes have limited memory. In this article, we consider the cache placement problem of minimizing total data access cost in ad hoc networks with multiple data items and nodes with limited memory capacity. The above optimization problem is known to be NP-hard. Defining benefit as the reduction in total access cost, we present a polynomial-time centralized approximation algorithm that provably delivers a solution whose benefit is at least one-fourth (one-half for uniform-size data items) of the optimal benefit. The approximation algorithm is amenable to localized distributed implementation, which is shown via simulations to perform close to the approximation algorithm. Our distributed algorithm naturally extends to networks with mobile nodes. We simulate our distributed algorithm using a network simulator (ns2), and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms another existing caching technique (by Yin and Cao [30]) in all important performance metrics. The performance differential is particularly large in more challenging scenarios, such as higher access frequency and smaller memory.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2006.320214","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110262/4110263/04110293.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2006.320214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110263","startPage":"208","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefit-based Data Caching in Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Benefit-based Data Caching in Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110293/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10236433","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4110293/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefit-based Data Caching in Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079124S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110262","isNumber":"4110263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110262","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4110263","articleId":"4110293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110301,"authors":[{"name":"Josh Karlin","affiliation":["University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Karlin","id":"37295086700"},{"name":"Stephanie Forrest","affiliation":["Santa Fe Institute, University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Forrest","id":"37288742600"},{"name":"Jennifer Rexford","affiliation":["Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Rexford","id":"37282342600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0593-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0594-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"4110301","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":442},"abstract":"The Internet's interdomain routing protocol, BGP, is vulnerable to a number of damaging attacks, which often arise from operator misconfiguration. Proposed solutions with strong guarantees require a public-key infrastructure, accurate routing registries, and changes to BGP. However, BGP routers can avoid selecting and propagating these routes if they are cautious about adopting new reachability information. We describe a protocol- preserving enhancement to BGP, Pretty Good BGP (PGBGP), that slows the dissemination of bogus routes, providing network operators time to respond before problems escalate into large- scale Internet attacks. Simulation results show that realistic deployments of PGBGP could provide 99% of Autonomous Systems with 24 hours to investigate and repair bogus routes without affecting prefix reachability. We also show that without PGBGP, 40% of ASs cannot avoid selecting bogus routes; with PGBGP, this number drops to less than 1%. Finally, we show that PGBGP is incrementally deployable and offers significant security benefits to early adopters and their customers.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/4110262/4110263/04110301.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2006.320179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2006.320179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pretty Good BGP: Improving BGP by Cautiously Adopting Routes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Protection","Iron","Internet","Public key","Detectors","IP networks","Telecommunication traffic","Computer crashes","Terrorism"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","internetworking","public key cryptography","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BGP","Internet interdomain routing protocol","public-key infrastructure","large-scale Internet attack","autonomous system","border gateway protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Pretty Good BGP: Improving BGP by Cautiously Adopting Routes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110301/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10236437","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pretty Good BGP: Improving BGP by Cautiously Adopting Routes","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059307S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110262","isNumber":"4110263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110262","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4110263","articleId":"4110301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4110305,"authors":[{"name":"Min Cao","firstName":"Min","lastName":"Cao","id":"37293296200"},{"name":"Vivek Raghunathan","firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Raghunathan","id":"37287444000"},{"name":"P.

We show how the MAC can also be used to mitigate the effect of fading. We begin by providing experimental data to demonstrate that multipath fading effects are seen at the MAC layer. These effects appear at timescales on the same order of the IEEE 802.11 protocol and therefore, interact negatively with the RTS-CTS-DATA-ACK handshake. We identify two types of MAC diversities to jointly combat fading and interference, called multi-receiver diversity and multi-channel diversity respectively, through canonical scenarios. In order to harness these MAC layer diversities, we propose a simple dynamic-binding multichannel MAC (DB-MCMAC) protocol that is backward compatible with IEEE 802.11. DB-MCMAC exploits MAC diversities by opportunistically acquiring the floor for the best receiver on each channel, and dynamically binding data transmissions after the floor has been acquired. We employ a simple continuous time Markov chain model to analyze the expected performance of the DB-MCMAC protocol. A comprehensive performance evaluation of DB-MCMAC using ns-2 shows that it can successfully harness multi-receiver and multi-channel fading and interference diversities to provide considerable improvements over a baseline multi-channel MAC in several situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110305/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10236440","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4110305/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Exploitation of MAC Layer Diversity in Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Exploitation of MAC Layer Diversity in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-00-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058402S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4110262","isNumber":"4110263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4110262","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4110263","articleId":"4110305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4110361,"authors":[{"name":"Gilgueng Hwang","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Gilgueng","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37290131400"},{"name":"Hideki Hashimoto","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37275318500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0717-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4110361","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Haptic interfaces","Optical microscopy","Force sensors","Actuators","Nanoscale devices","Self-assembly","Optical sensors","Micromechanical devices","Grippers","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulators","haptic interfaces","microassembling","micromanipulators","robotic assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous bilateral nanomanipulation system","3D nano device","dexterous 3D nanoassembly technology","scanning electro microscope","optical microscope","multiple nanomanipulators","human-friendly haptic interface","electro statically actuated MEMS microgripper","electromagnetically functionalized probe tip","glue functionalized tip"]}],"abstract":"To build complex 3D nano device such as nano scale force sensor or actuators, it requires dexterous 3D nanoassembly technology adding to 2D microfabrication or self-assembly of nano particles.

The key feature of the model is an assumption of frequency-dependent load power, rather than the usual impedance loads which are subsequently absorbed into a reduced network. The original network topology is explicitly represented. This approach has the important advantage of rigorously accounting for real power loads in the Lyapunov functions. This compares favorably with existing methods involving approximations to allow for the significant transfer conductances in reduced network models. The preservation of network topology can be exploited in stability analysis, with the concepts of critical and vulnerable cutsets playing central roles in dynamic and transient stability evaluation respectively.

In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed techniques is examined using a six bus model of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation system, and the IEEE 14, 30 and 57-bus test systems. A single pass of generation rescheduling and load shedding has been found to be adequate for alleviating line overloads in almost all the systems studied. Computational time of each pass of these techniques is approximately 1/2 to 3/4th of the computational time required for the initial load flow. Storage requirements are slightly more than the requirements of the load flow technique used. The proposed techniques identify and determine the existence of a physically realizable operating condition to alleviate the line overload condition. The techniques appear attractive for security and reliability studies, and for operational planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110446/","volume":"PAS-100","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Generation Rescheduling and Load Shedding to Alleviate Line Overloads-System Studies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation Rescheduling and Load Shedding to Alleviate Line Overloads-System Studies","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-100-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026444S","chronDate":"Jan.  1981","isNumber":"4110440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"25","articleId":"4110446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4110449,"authors":[{"name":"Clark W.

The Inverse Fourier Transform is avoided by direct frequency domain fitting: either interpolation (exact for selected points) or weighted least squares approximation.

Recently, a linear programming technique for economic dispatch has been developed that optimally dispatches generation such that reserve margins and ramp rate constraints are also met at minimum cost. This paper presents a method that combines these dynamic and linear programming techniques such that the real operational constraints of reserve margins and ramp rates are optimally met by the resulting generation schedules. A major advantage of this method is that it can be used to determine the minimum cost of providing a particular level of reserves or operating with a particular set of ramp rate capabilities. Such a costing method makes it feasible to make economic decisions on whether to buy or sell regulation or spinning margin, or whether to install new ramping capability. The algorithm, program design, and the results for a large midwestern utility are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1981.316713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4110845/04110859.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1981.316713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110845","startPage":"2226","endPage":"2230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of Generation and Reserve Margin Using Dynamic and Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling of Generation and Reserve Margin Using Dynamic and Linear Programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4110859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-100","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1981","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling of Generation and Reserve Margin Using Dynamic and Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-100-n5-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034342S","chronDate":"May  1981","isNumber":"4110845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"31","articleId":"4110859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4110872,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

For weather insensitive end-uses, the use factors are functions of time (i. e., time of day, day type, and month); while for the weather sensitive end-uses, they are functions of time as well as a camposite weather variable.

It is shown that substantial damping can be achieved with a relatively small resistor bank, thus reducing the risk of significant shaft damage due to electrical disturbances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1981","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"July 1981","volume":"PAS-100","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Damping Shaft Torsional Oscillations Using a Dynamically Controlled Resistor Bank","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping Shaft Torsional Oscillations Using a Dynamically Controlled Resistor Bank","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-100-n7-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044082S","chronDate":"July  1981","isNumber":"4110988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4111012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4111018,"authors":[{"name":"Adly A.

The noise in this case is the nonfundamental frequency components in the transient current or voltage, as the case may be. For research and development purposes of computer relaying techniques, the precise nature of the noise signal is required. The autocorrelation function and variance of the noise signal was obtained based on the frequency of occurrence of the different types of faults, and the probability distribution of fault location. A new technique for modelling the signal and the measurements is developed based on Kalman Filtering theory for the optimal estimation of the 60 Hz information. The results indicate that the technique converges to the true 60 Hz quanitities faster than other algorithms that have been used. The new technique also has the lowest computer burden among recently published algorithms and appears to be within the state of the art of current microcomputer technology.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1981.316681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4110988/04111018.pdf","startPage":"3387","endPage":"3397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1981.316681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4110988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Kalman Filtering in Computer Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111018/","displayDocTitle":"Application of Kalman Filtering in Computer Relaying","volume":"PAS-100","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Kalman Filtering in Computer Relaying","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-100-n7-30.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024916S","chronDate":"July  1981","isNumber":"4110988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"115","articleId":"4111018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4111027,"authors":[{"name":"Floyd J.

Probability methods are being used extensively in the assessment of static adequacy. Their application to the evaluation of transient or dynamic phenomena has not yet, however, been widely utilized. The probabilistic nature of the transient stability problem and the inclusion of the probabilities associated with the initiating factors such as the type, location and clearance of faults in the analysis of a simple single machine-infinite bus system has been demonstrated in a recent paper.1 The present paper addresses the problem of transient stability analysis in a practical multimachine system from a probabilistic view-point. The basic concepts developed in Reference ! are applied to a simplified 33 bus model based on the Saskatchewan Power Corporation (SPC) system, to demonstrate the technique of considering the probabilities associated with the occurrence and clearance of faults. Transient stability indices for each line, for different types of faults and a single stability index for any fault are obtained. A single stability index for the overall system is evaluated for different fault types and amy fault using actual system outage statistics. The effect of fault clearing and reclosing times on the system stability is investigated for the most critical line in the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111045/","volume":"PAS-100","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1981","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Assessment of Transient Stability in a Practical Multimachine System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Assessment of Transient Stability in a Practical Multimachine System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-100-n7-57.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041047S","chronDate":"July  1981","isNumber":"4110988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"98","articleId":"4111045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4111057,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Such stringent requirements necessitate a high degree of accuracy in predicting machine performance at the design stage, for which sophisticated analytical tools are essential. In this paper, a rigorous three-dimensional magnetic field analysis based on the finite element method is presented. The correct choice of the vector potential solution is established and it is shown that the variational formulation yields an energy-related functional associated with the vector Poisson equation which, when minimized, results in the true solution to the field problem. The analysis developed is applied to illustrative geometries; the principal amongst these being a two-winding transformer and a segment of a turbine generator.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1981.316996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111054/04111092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1981.316996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111054","startPage":"4007","endPage":"4019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Magnetostatic Field Analysis of Electrical Machinery by the Finite-Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Magnetostatic Field Analysis of Electrical Machinery by the Finite-Element Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-100","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Magnetostatic Field Analysis of Electrical Machinery by the Finite-Element Method","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-100-n8-38.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045616S","chronDate":"Aug.  1981","isNumber":"4111054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4111092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4111095,"authors":[{"name":"Rotating Machinery Committee","firstName":"Rotating Machinery","lastName":"Committee"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4111095","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Rotating machines","Insulation","Coils","Machinery","Impulse testing","Stator windings","Surge protection","IEC standards","Uncertainty"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulse Voltage Strength of AC Rotating Machines","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1981.316999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111054","endPage":"4053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111054/04111095.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1981.316999","startPage":"4041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111095","abstract":"The absence of generally accepted standards for the impulse voltage withstand capability of ac rotating machines has led to inconsistency and uncertainty in insulation coordination in systems including these machines.

In this class of machines, the armature MMF is a discretely forward stepping one of high harmonic content. The discretely stepping MMF is accounted for by a series of finite element field solutions as the rotor moves throughout one complete cycle of the ac armature current. Because of the discretely forward travelling MMF, a series of finite element grids depicting the rotor at various equally spaced locations, covering its movement during one cycle of the armature current, is required. This is accomplished by means of an automated algorithm for generation of the required finite elemennt grids. This allows one to match any stator grid to any rotor grid for any given displacement between the two grids. This matching is done in the air gap region by fitting it with a suitable row of triangular elements. In addition, a permanent magnet model is developed based upon the magnet geometry and material properties. This method was applied to the analysis of a 15 hp samarium cobalt machine at both rated and no load conditions. The calculated results were in excellent agreement with search coil measurements at both of these operating conditions. These solutions were then used to determine the midgap EMF waveforms. The calculated midgap EMF was in excellent agreement with an oscillogram of the actual EMF in both waveshape and magnitude.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Field Modeling of Permanent Magnet Type Electronically Operated Synchronous Machines Using Finite Elements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1981.316957","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111106/04111109.pdf","startPage":"4125","endPage":"4135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1981.316957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Field Modeling of Permanent Magnet Type Electronically Operated Synchronous Machines Using Finite Elements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-100","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Field Modeling of Permanent Magnet Type Electronically Operated Synchronous Machines Using Finite Elements","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-100-n9-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093513S","chronDate":"Sept.  1981","isNumber":"4111106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"48","articleId":"4111109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4111111,"authors":[{"name":"Satoru Ihara","affiliation":["General Electric Company Limited, Schenectady, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Ihara","id":"37089142782"},{"name":"Fred C.

An optimization model has been developed for these problems that incorporates minimum up and down time constraints, demand and reserve constraints, cooling-time dependent startup-costs, and time varying shutdown costs, as well as other practical considerations. A solution methodology has been developed for the optimization model that has two unique features. First, computational requirements grow only linearly with the number of units. Second, performance of the algorithm can be shown (rigorously) to actually improve as the number of units increases. With a preliminary computer implementation of the algorithm, we have been able to reliably solve problems with 250 units over 12 (2-hour) time periods, and we expect to be able to easily double these numbers.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111130/04111142.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111130","startPage":"79","endPage":"86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solution of Large-Scale Optimal Unit Commitment Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Solution of Large-Scale Optimal Unit Commitment Problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-101","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solution of Large-Scale Optimal Unit Commitment Problems","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09456S","chronDate":"Jan.  1982","isNumber":"4111130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"105","articleId":"4111142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4111146,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Almost all contingency analysis programs have had to rely on a list of selected contingencies to be studied. The brute force approach of testing all contingencies every time an evaluation of the system performance is needed, becomes prohibitive due to its computational burden. A particularly attractive technique is to utilize a fast, approximate method to select the few contingencies that actually affect the security of the power system and then analyze only these cases in more detail. The contingency ranking and selection methods presented in the literature have all ranked outage cases on the basis of transmission line overloads. This limits the usefulness of these technqiues as contingencies that cause only voltage problems are totally overlooked. This paper shows that there is little correlation between the contingencies that produce line overloads and those that result in unacceptable voltage profiles, further establishing the need for a contingency selection method that is also voltage sensitive. Such a method, using the first iteration of an AC power flow, is presented. It is shown that the method meets both the speed and accuracy requirements for on-line use.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317327","startPage":"107","endPage":"112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111130/04111146.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive Power Considerations in Automatic Contingency Selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Power system analysis computing","Load flow","Power system security","Voltage","Transmission line matrix methods","Steady-state","Power transmission lines","Gradient methods","Performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Reactive Power Considerations in Automatic Contingency Selection","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive Power Considerations in Automatic Contingency Selection","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n1-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033072S","chronDate":"Jan.  1982","isNumber":"4111130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"108","articleId":"4111146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4111151,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Brown's method is used to solve load-flow problems. The method is Particularly effective for solving of ill-conditioned non- linear algebraic equations. It is a variation of Newton's method incorporating Gaussian elimination in such a way that the most recent infonnation is always used at each step of the algorithm; similar to what is done in the Gauss-Seidel process. The iteration converges locally and the convergence is quadratic in nature. A general discussion of ill-conditioning of a system of algebraic equations is given, and it is also show by the fixed-point formulation that the proposed method falls in the general category of sucessive approximation methods. Digital computer solutions by the proposed method are given for cases for which the standard load-flow methods failed to converge, namely 11-, 13- and 43-bus ill-conditioned test systems.

The results indicate that both the electrode area and the stressed oil volume can affect the dielectric strength of transformer oil, with the stressed-oil-volume effect being most pronounced under particle contamination conditions. Test results with technically clean transformer oil as currently accepted for use in power apparatus indicate that the degree of particle contamination in these oils is sufficient to produce an observable stressed-oil-volume effect. Finally, it is demonstrated that the observed phenomenon can be interpreted in terms of an apparent effect of either the electrode area or the stressed oil volume. This has led to the development of a semi-empirical method of quantitatively assessing the breakdown phenomenon in large oil volumes with reasonable accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111169/04111184.pdf","startPage":"3712","endPage":"3721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Dielectric Degradation of Large-Volume Oil-Insulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Petroleum","Electrodes","Oil insulation","Stress","Dielectric breakdown","Testing","Electric breakdown","Surface contamination","Breakdown voltage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Dielectric Degradation of Large-Volume Oil-Insulation","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Dielectric Degradation of Large-Volume Oil-Insulation","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n10-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036885S","chronDate":"Oct.  1982","isNumber":"4111169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"47","articleId":"4111184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4111185,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The method is shown to be well suited to large scale (500 buses or more) power systems in that it is computationally efficient and is particularly effective with infeasible starting points. The optimization approach is based on transforming the original problem to that of solving a sequence of linearly constrained subproblems using an augmented Lagrangian type objective function. A fundamental feature of this algorithm (developed by Murtagh and Saunders) is that the solution converges quadratically on the nonlinear power flow constraints, rather than being forced to satisfy the constraints throughout the iterative process. To demonstrate the performance of this algorithm, a set of descent directions, which includes quasi-Newton (variable metric), conjugate directions, and steepest descent, are compared on the basis of convergence and computational effort for a 118 bus and a 600 bus power system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111169/04111185.pdf","startPage":"3722","endPage":"3732","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large Scale Optimal Power Flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Large Scale Optimal Power Flow","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Scale Optimal Power Flow","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n10-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029521S","chronDate":"Oct.  1982","isNumber":"4111169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"95","articleId":"4111185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4111193,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Improved performance is realized by utilizing reactive power coupling between dc and ac networks to modulate dc and ac active power. For the demonstration system, power modulation with coordinated voltage modulation is shown to be about ten times more effective than power modulation alone. Control interactions between electromechanical modes of oscillation are eliminated by Kalman filtering. Filtering permits excellent control performance with a minimum of system measurements.

This paper presents two numerical methods for the reconstruction of the input signal x(t) from the distorted output signal y(t) and the step response g(t) of the measuring system. The first one, the deconvolution algorithm, is suitable for theoretical studies when the numerical values of y(t) and g(t) are exactly known, e.g., by their analytical expressions. But in practical applications, when measuring errors and disturbances are superposed on y(t) and g(t), this rather sensitive algorithm seems to be useless. An approximated reconstruction method is proposed by which the input signal is adequately composed of linearly rising elements and then improved by triangular elements according to the difference of the recalculated output signal to the true one. Both methods are illustrated by several numerical examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of High Impulse Voltages Considering the Step Response of the Measuring System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111169/04111232.pdf","startPage":"4147","endPage":"4155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of High Impulse Voltages Considering the Step Response of the Measuring System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-101","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of High Impulse Voltages Considering the Step Response of the Measuring System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n10-63.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038776S","chronDate":"Oct.  1982","isNumber":"4111169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4111232","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4111246,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The method is totally general and utilizes numerical field calculation techniques in obtaining stored energy in the magnetic circuits of such machines. Thus, it can be applied to a wide class of machinery with practically any cross-sectional contours and number of windings. It can be used at any given set of excitations (any loads). This method was applied to the calculation of the apparent and incremental inductances of a 15 hp samarium cobalt permanent magnet synchronous machine. The necessary-numerical field soluitions were obtained by finite elements at both rated and no load conditions. The calculated inductances, at various rotor positions, were compared with those obtained during laboratory measurements and the agreement between calculated and measured values was consistently very good. The advantage of this method over the more traditional calculations of only the direct and quadrature axes inductances (or reactances, including transient and subtransient components) is that the entire n > n matrix of incremental inductances that truely govern the dynamic performance of an n winding machine can be determined regardless of the validity of a rotating d-q-o frame of reference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of Saturated Values of Rotating Machinery Incremental and Apparent Inductances by an Energy Perturbation Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317296","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111275/04111278.pdf","startPage":"4441","endPage":"4451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111278/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Determination of Saturated Values of Rotating Machinery Incremental and Apparent Inductances by an Energy Perturbation Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-101","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of Saturated Values of Rotating Machinery Incremental and Apparent Inductances by an Energy Perturbation Method","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n12-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0591S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"4111275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"92","articleId":"4111278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4111301,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The possibility of such a disturbance has led to increased interest in the application of automatic under-frequency protection schemes to restore load/generation balance and to prevent equipment damage. In this paper a new method for detecting changes in the power system frequency, by relating it to a leakage coefficient in the FFT, is presented. The algorithm computes the deviation of the power system frequency from the fundamental component and the best estimate of its rate of change. The algorithm then predicts the percentage generation and load imbalance, and finally trips the appropriate amounts of load at the appropriate time delays.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111316/04111343.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New FFT-Based Digital Frequency Relay for Load Shedding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital relays","Power system restoration","Power system protection","Power system relaying","Change detection algorithms","Frequency estimation","Protective relaying","Power generation","Leak detection","Prediction algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1982","displayDocTitle":"A New FFT-Based Digital Frequency Relay for Load Shedding","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New FFT-Based Digital Frequency Relay for Load Shedding","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n2-27.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023498S","chronDate":"Feb.  1982","isNumber":"4111316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"87","articleId":"4111343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4111346,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Nian-de","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Departmen, Tsinghua University, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Nian-de","id":"38272762800"},{"name":"Wang Shi-ying","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Departmen, Tsinghua University, Japan"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Shi-ying","id":"38277186400"},{"name":"Yu Er-keng","affiliation":["Computer Application Laboratory Ministry of Electric Power, Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Er-keng","id":"38272501700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4111346","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":552},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","State estimation","Power system reliability","Power system measurements","Power measurement","Power system control","Control systems","Power system simulation","Real time systems","Testing"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new approach for detection and identification of ultiple bad data --- estimation-identification approach which has been developed in order to improve the performance of static-state estimators of power systems.

The concept of a long range horizon year (target) is used together with a time-phased expansion process beginning with the base year and progressing to the target year. An optimal static horizon year design is first determined using a fixed charge transshipment problem formulation (FCNP). The FCNP solution methodology employs the branch-and- bound algorithm and includes explicit modeling of fixed charge and variable cost components for improved accu- racy. The time-phased expansion process selects substation sites and feeder routings from the horizon (or target) year plan, thus providing an orderly and coherent expansion. This method easily incorporates existing facilities in the decision process for maximum benefit. An example of an actual planning study is presented to illustrate the horizon year target system selection and the corresponding time-phased expansion patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317273","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111355/04111368.pdf","startPage":"602","endPage":"609","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Distribution Substation and Primary Feeder Planning VIA the Fixed Charge Network Formulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Distribution Substation and Primary Feeder Planning VIA the Fixed Charge Network Formulation","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"March 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Distribution Substation and Primary Feeder Planning VIA the Fixed Charge Network Formulation","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n3-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030582S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"4111355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"103","articleId":"4111368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4111370,"authors":[{"name":"V.

These routines have been interfaced to the BPA Electromagnetic Transients Program for state-space modeling of frequency dependence in transmission lines, and have digital-filter design capabilities.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111389","startPage":"915","endPage":"923","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111389/04111410.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power System Indentification by Fitting Structured Models to Measured Frequency Response","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1982","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power System Indentification by Fitting Structured Models to Measured Frequency Response","publicationDate":"April 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Indentification by Fitting Structured Models to Measured Frequency Response","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n4-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033521S","chronDate":"April  1982","isNumber":"4111389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"22","articleId":"4111410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4111412,"authors":[{"name":"J.

One new algorithm, which employs a constant, decoupled gain matrix and certain other simplifying approximations, is shown to be clearly superior to the other methods considered; accordingly this algorithm has been chosen for use in AEP's new control center. The selected algorithm is fast, reliable and can process a measurement set consisting of line flows, bus injections and voltage magnitudes. Test results are given for several real networks and some standard IEEE test systems (having as many as 460 buses and R/X ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2). The network conditions used in the tests range from light load to severe contingencies with low voltages and large phase angles. A wide variety of practical and hypothetical measurement sets are considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111389/04111412.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast and Reliable State Estimation Algorithm for AEP's New Control Center","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Gain measurement","Fluid flow measurement","Noise measurement","Voltage","Iterative algorithms","Covariance matrix","System testing","Data engineering","Power engineering and energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1982","displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Reliable State Estimation Algorithm for AEP's New Control Center","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast and Reliable State Estimation Algorithm for AEP's New Control Center","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n4-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044781S","chronDate":"April  1982","isNumber":"4111389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"105","articleId":"4111412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4111415,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To prove the method, energized scale models of a \u00b1400-kV HVDC test line and of the Arrowhead \u00b1250-kV converter station have been designed and built in order to compare the electric field distribution of the full-scale facilities with that of the models. Linear scale factors were 1/50 for the line and 1/33.33 for the station. The paper reviews instrumentation, modeling and scaling problems and their solutions: calibration and verification test; and discusses the accuracy of the model measurements. Comparison of corresponding ground level electric field strength test ranges shows that the agreement between full-scale and model measurements is good. Techniques were developed for full- scale and model conductor tests in laboratories, and for field and model experiments. An experimental method (the method of images) of determining the corona onset voltage of actual bipolar HVDC transmission lines with single conductors was developed. Additional experiments were conducted in various areas of the model converter station. Features studied were: electric field and ion current profiles under energized and partially deenergized conditions, effects of ground wires, and effects of shielding. The feasibility of worst case open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current measurements on model objects and vehicles was demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111515/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1982","publicationDate":"June 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Model Study of VDC ELlectric Field Effect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Study of VDC ELlectric Field Effect","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n6-60.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053621S","chronDate":"June  1982","isNumber":"4111455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4111515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4111537,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Also, the magnitude of current injection need not be matched to the fault current; excess charge is preferred.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111612/04111660.pdf","startPage":"2721","endPage":"2727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1982.317643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1982.317643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forced Commutation Performance of Vaccum Switches for HVDC Breaker Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","HVDC transmission","Circuit testing","Voltage","Switching circuits","Capacitance","Inductors","Circuit breakers","Inductance","Capacitors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Forced Commutation Performance of Vaccum Switches for HVDC Breaker Application","volume":"PAS-101","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forced Commutation Performance of Vaccum Switches for HVDC Breaker Application","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-101-n8-48.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041987S","chronDate":"Aug.  1982","isNumber":"4111612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4111660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4111679,"authors":[{"name":"T.

SMA allows one to focus on any prespecified dynamic pattern of intrest in the model.

SMA is particularly suitable for dealing with composite models, i.e. models consisting of several dynamic subsystems interrelated by static constraints. An introduction to the basic concepts of SMA pertinent to the applications being considered here is presented in the companion paper [3]. This paper concerns the application of SMA to the Dynamic Stability problem in electric power systems; it is shown how SMA is well suited to meet the demanding requirements of Dynamic Stability analysis.

To faithfully simulate the behavior of the rotor iron for small signal perturbations, measured values for incremental permeability are used. A finite-element grid tailored to handle the skin effect at frequencies up to 100 hertz has been developed. The paper is semi-tutorial in nature and is intended as a basis for future papers, which will compare the results of calculations by this method to test data.

In the conventional equations linear magnetic conditions are assumed and the forms taken by these equations in various reference frames are well known. When saturation of the main flux path is taken into account, some parameters have to be modified and additional terms introduced; stator (and rotor) self inductances in orthogonal axes are no longer equal. These are the consequence of intersaturation - sometimes called cross-saturation; a phenomenon which has been mentioned in the literature but has not been subjected to general analysis.

The two machines were built to operate from the same power conditioner, which consisted of a transistor chopper in series with a three phase full wave inverter/converter bridge, which consists of six transistor-diode switches. Both of the two motors achieved a continuous 2 hour rating of more than 15 hp with a peak one minute rating of 35 hp.

The study used a mail survey to determine the residential user's assessment of the cost of electric service interruptions. The survey obtained user's cost valuation using three approaches. Two of these approaches asked respondents to indicate rate changes that would be commensurate with specified changes in reliability, while the third approach was an indirect worth evaluation based on the preparatory actions a consumer predicted he would take, given a specified (un) reliability. User's valuations are reported for a number of frequency and duration failure scenarios. Variations of user cost estimates are discussed as functions of several user characteristics. Comparisons with the results of other researchers are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111835/","volume":"PAS-102","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Interruption Cost Methodology and Results - A canadian Residential Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interruption Cost Methodology and Results - A canadian Residential Survey","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n10-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025814S","chronDate":"Oct.  1983","isNumber":"4111819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"33","articleId":"4111835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4111838,"authors":[{"name":"Th.

The charge measurement is performed using electrostatic probe and dust figure techniques. The charge accumulation is strongly influenced by the surface condition of epoxy spacer. Heterocharge deposits locally on the surface of untreated spacer. The flashover voltage of highly charged spacer decreases considerably at the time of polarity reversal. In the case of epoxy surface treated with horning, only a small quantity of charge is deposited uniformly on the surface of spacer. The mechanism of inhomogeneous surface conduction is suggested by the local surface charging on the untreated spacer. Field emission is also found as the other charging mechanism on the conical spacer set in rough finish electrode system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111890/04111920.pdf","startPage":"3919","endPage":"3927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1983.317931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1983.317931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface Charging On Epoxy Spacer At Dc Stress In Compressed SF6 GAS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface charging","Stress","Sulfur hexafluoride","Surface treatment","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Voltage","Charge measurement","Performance evaluation","Electrostatics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Surface Charging On Epoxy Spacer At Dc Stress In Compressed SF6 GAS","volume":"PAS-102","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Charging On Epoxy Spacer At Dc Stress In Compressed SF6 GAS","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n12-30.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037794S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"4111890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"120","articleId":"4111920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4111937,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Finite element analysis is employed to model the constituent parts of a grounding system. Short lengths of earth embedded electrodes are characterized as transmission lines with distributed inductance, capacitance and leakage resistance to earth. Leakage resistance to earth is accurately computed with the method of moments. The other parameters of the finite element, namely inductance and capacitance, are computed from the resistance utilizing Maxwell's equations. This modeling enables the computation of the transient response of substation grounding systems to fast or slow waves striking the substation. The result is obtained in terms of a convolution of the step response of the system and the striking wave. In this way the impedance of substation systems to 60 cycles is accurately computed. Results demonstrate the dependence of the 60 cycle impedance on system parameters. The methodology allows to interface this model of a substation ground mat with the Electromagnetic Transient Analysis Program thus, allowing explicit representation of earth effects in electromagmatic transients computations.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1983.317686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111926/04111945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1983.317686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111926","startPage":"389","endPage":"399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Analysis of Grounding Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4111945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transient Analysis of Grounding Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4111945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-102","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Analysis of Grounding Systems","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n2-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029667S","chronDate":"Feb.  1983","isNumber":"4111926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"105","articleId":"4111945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4111947,"authors":[{"name":"Shan C.

The results show that assessment of the Young's modulus of the insulating layers of the impregnated windings and the wedges is the most important, and that the insulating layers of the windings can be reasonably dealt with as having a value of about 30% of the converged equivalent Young's modulus, and the wedges as having a value of 100% of that of their material.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural Frequencies and Vibration Behaviour of Motor Stators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1983.317808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4111996/04112020.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1983.317808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4111996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1983","displayDocTitle":"Natural Frequencies and Vibration Behaviour of Motor Stators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-102","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"April 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural Frequencies and Vibration Behaviour of Motor Stators","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n4-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019287S","chronDate":"April  1983","isNumber":"4111996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4112020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4112022,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The zinc oxide ceramic energy absorber is an extinguishing medium with capabilities beyond the counterparts used in the conventional high-speed circuit breakers. The withstand-voltage, the interrupting time and the surge energy to be extinguished during interrupting are considered, together with parameter values specified in JEC Standard. Each energy absorber for the prototype DC 1500V-3000A thyristor circuit breaker consists of twenty four 115 mmo 15 mm thick zinc oxide ceramic elements and is capable of absorbing 400 kJ. The performance of these assembled devices in an energy absorber and incorporated with a thyristor circuit breaker as well as in the discrete form have been verified.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1983.318097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112033/04112086.pdf","startPage":"1429","endPage":"1436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1983.318097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Zinc Oxide Ceramic Energy Absorbers for DC Thyristor Circuit Breakers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112086/","displayDocTitle":"Development of Zinc Oxide Ceramic Energy Absorbers for DC Thyristor Circuit Breakers","volume":"PAS-102","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Zinc Oxide Ceramic Energy Absorbers for DC Thyristor Circuit Breakers","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n5-53.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124725S","chronDate":"May  1983","isNumber":"4112033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4112086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4112109,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

Cost functions have been defined for optimizing the choice of both fixed and switched capacitors. A direct search technique known as the Method of Local Viariations has been employed for solving the resulting discrete variational problem. The problem has also been solved using Dynamic Programming Approach for comparison. The proposed method has been illustrated through some actual cases of radial feeders existing in an Indian distribution network.

However, the occurrence of disturbances and their attendant protective switching sequences are random processes and it would be more meaningful to determine the probability of stability for a power system. An approach for such a determination is presented in this paper. The probability of steady state stability is relatively easier to determine because of the linearization of the system equations. The probability of transient stability, on the other hand, is much more difficult to obtain analytically because of the nonlinear transformations required. However, a Monte Carlo simulation method to determine transient stability probability is shown to be feasible.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1983.317742","startPage":"2430","endPage":"2439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1983.317742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112225","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112225/04112235.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Approach to Power System Stability Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112235/","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Approach to Power System Stability Analysis","volume":"PAS-102","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Approach to Power System Stability Analysis","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n8-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032018S","chronDate":"Aug.  1983","isNumber":"4112225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"74","articleId":"4112235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4112279,"authors":[{"name":"Lahcene Ouazene","affiliation":["Institut National d''Electricit\u00e9 et dE28099Electronique, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Lahcene","lastName":"Ouazene","id":"37088251577"},{"name":"George McPherson","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Missouri, Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"McPherson","id":"37299362300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4112279","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":731},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction generators","Frequency","Voltage","AC generators","Rotors","Fuels","Power generation","Capacitance","Energy resources","Wind energy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112279","abstract":"The increasing rate of depletion of conventional energy resources and the ability of induction generators to convert mechanical power over a wide range of rotor speeds have given rise to an interest in the possible contribution of wind energy to provide fuel displacement.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1983.317962","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112225/04112279.pdf","startPage":"2793","endPage":"2798","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1983.317962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Isolated Induction Generator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Isolated Induction Generator","volume":"PAS-102","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Isolated Induction Generator","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n8-54.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165436S","chronDate":"Aug.  1983","isNumber":"4112225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"121","articleId":"4112279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4112290,"authors":[{"name":"Adly A.

It is shown that the photovoltaic power system, utilizing the proposed method of power tracking, is able to track accurately peak power conditions during periods of randomly varying insolation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","volume":"PAS-102","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Behavior of a Class of Photovoltaic Power Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Behavior of a Class of Photovoltaic Power Systems","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n9-27.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052053S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"4112285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"199","articleId":"4112312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4112319,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The system uses a passive reflective fibre-optics sensor which is immune to EMI and functions correctly on an excited operating generator. Air gap tests were performed on four 184 MV. A, 15.6 m stator bore diameter generators with 16 radial stator support rods. One of these units at B. C. Hydro's Peace Canyon Project suffered rotor-stator contact damage during commissioning in November 1979. Thirty-two air gap measurements were made around the stator during consecutive revolutions, at precisely repeatable points at, and midway between, the noted support rods. These measurements were used to produce a series of polar coordinate air gap maps which facilitated very fine trend analysis of the critical modes of generator operation. These tests and the interpretation of the data, which assisted in the solution of specific problems, are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1983.318116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112285/04112319.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1983.318116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112285","startPage":"3098","endPage":"3106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Measurement And Analysis Of Air Gap Variations In Large Hydroelectric Generators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Measurement And Analysis Of Air Gap Variations In Large Hydroelectric Generators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112319/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-102","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Measurement And Analysis Of Air Gap Variations In Large Hydroelectric Generators","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-102-n9-34.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073609S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"4112285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4112319","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4112337,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A beneficial effect of ground rods is evaluated in view of the present equation for the current irrregularity factor Ki. A brief analysis of the effect of a crush-stone overlay upon the allowable surface voltage above and beyond a grounding grid, is also icluded. A review of work done by others related to the methods of Std 80 includes a discussion of equations and of some critical aspects involved. A computer-produced series, comparing the performance of the old simplified and non-simplified equations for-Km with the improved ones and with the equations suggested by Thapar and Nagar, Zuker- man, Zink, and Nahman, concludes Part I of this two-part report.

Efficient, robust solutions can be obtained for problems of any practical size or kind. Solution effort is approximately proportional to network size, and is relatively independent of the number of controls or binding inequalities. The key idea is a direct simultaneous solution for all of the unknowns in the Lagrangian function on each iteration. Each iteration minimizes a quadratic approximation of the Lagrangian. For any given set of binding constraints the process converges to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions in a few iterations. The challenge in algorithm development is to efficiently identify the binding inequalities.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112375/04112388.pdf","startPage":"2864","endPage":"2880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Flow By Newton Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Flow By Newton Approach","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Flow By Newton Approach","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n10-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049714S","chronDate":"Oct.  1984","isNumber":"4112375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"606","articleId":"4112388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4112394,"authors":[{"name":"Gerard N.

Four utility systems are studied using a variety of objective functions, including fuel costs, active and reactive losses, and new shunt capacitors. Systems solved range from 350 buses to 2000 buses. Comparisons are made with an older algorithm which uses an Augmented Lagrangian to demonstrate the advantages of run time and robustness of the new method. The algorithm and accompanying software represent a technological breakthrough, since they are suitable for solving systems on the order of 2000 buses and demonstrate solution speeds of 5 minutes on large mainframe computers. The method is particularly well suited to infeasible, or even divergent starting points. An option to add shunt capacitors in the event of hopeless infeasibility guarantees an optimal solution for many difficult to solve systems. An automatic scaling feature is added to correct numerical ill-conditioning resulting from series compensation or poor R/X ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112426/04112441.pdf","startPage":"3267","endPage":"3275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadratically Convergent Optimal Power Flow","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112441/","displayDocTitle":"Quadratically Convergent Optimal Power Flow","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadratically Convergent Optimal Power Flow","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n11-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074338S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"4112426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"245","articleId":"4112441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4112474,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshiro Ikura","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Group, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Rose Consulting, San Francisco, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yoshiro","lastName":"Ikura","id":"37089142594"},{"name":"George Gross","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Group, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Rose Consulting, San Francisco, CA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Gross","id":"37268076300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4112474","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112474","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Optimal scheduling","Reservoirs","Constraint optimization","Power generation","Water resources","Systems engineering and theory","Rivers","Decision feedback equalizers","Power system planning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318381","startPage":"3502","endPage":"3520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112459/04112474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Large-Scale Hydro System Scheduling with Forced Spill Conditions","abstract":"We present a general framework for the formulation and solution of large-scale hydro system scheduling problems (h.s.s.p.). We use a nonlinear programming formulation that permits the representation of virtually all types of constraints imposed on a hydroelectric system: the physical, operational, legislative or contractual constraints. The problem formulation explicitly represents the nonlinear relationship between spillage and the reservoir storage level. Such constraints are called forced spill conditions and are modeled by nonlinear equalities. In the proposed method, the nonlinear constraints representing the forced spill conditions are treated by the exact penalty technique. The resulting problem has a nonlinear objective function and only linear constraints. The solution scheme makes detailed use of the structural characteristics of the h.s.s.p. The underlying network structure of the h.s.s.p. is exploited to determine a good starting point via the application of an efficient network flow algorithm. The sparsity of the linear constraints is exploited by the nonlinear optimization algorithm. The proposed method is computationally efficient for determining optimal schedules for large river systems.

For an electrode spacing of 2.5 meters or greater, satisfactory agreement is obtained between measured and computed results using both interpretation techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earth","Conductivity measurement","Grounding","Power system analysis computing","Power transmission lines","Power system modeling","Transmission line theory","Transmission line measurements","Senior members","Resists"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318254","startPage":"374","endPage":"382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112502/04112522.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Earth Resistivity Measurement Interpretation Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Earth Resistivity Measurement Interpretation Techniques","publicationDate":"Feb. 1984","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Earth Resistivity Measurement Interpretation Techniques","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n2-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033478S","chronDate":"Feb.  1984","isNumber":"4112502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"79","articleId":"4112522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4112552,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The 150-kW wind turbine, designated MOD-OA by the U.S. Department of Energy is typically operated in parallel with two diesel generators to serve an average winter load of 350 kW. As part of an experimental program to evaluate wind turbine generator performance on the isolated diesel power system, the recordings from an extensive data measurement effort were reviewed and analyzed to define the nature of the dynamic interaction effects. The data were collected over a three-month period on the system to which the DOE/NASA experimental wind turbine was connected. During this time, the diesel units were lightly loaded resulting in up to 60% of the total load demand being supplied by the MOD-OA in periods of severely gusting winds. In three of the modes of normal MOD-OA operation -- startup-synchronization, shutdown/cutout, and continuous fixed pitch running -- power, frequency and voltage transients were comparable with those produced by typical load changes on the diesel system alone. In the fourth mode, variable pitch (constant power) control, a significant reduction in system damping sometimes occurred which gave rise to increased frequency and voltage perturbations under gusty wind conditions. Based on a linear model of the system it is shown that changes in control system settings could be made to improve damping.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112604/04112612.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind Turbine Generator Interaction With Diesel Generators on an Isolated Power System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112612/","displayDocTitle":"Wind Turbine Generator Interaction With Diesel Generators on an Isolated Power System","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind Turbine Generator Interaction With Diesel Generators on an Isolated Power System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n5-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035271S","chronDate":"May  1984","isNumber":"4112604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"53","articleId":"4112612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4112613,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

The theory is given for selecting the set of weights in the scalar performance index (PI) for both real power and voltage problems in order to circumvent some of the misranking problems, and more importantly, how to select the threshold value of the PI in order to capture all the critical contingencies while minimizing the capture of the non- critical ones.

The reheat effect of the steam turbines is considered in the state space model. The effect of governor dead-band nonlinearity is considered by using the describing function approach and including the linearized equations in the state space model. It is shown that the governor dead-band nonlinearity has a destabilizing effect on the transient response with deterministic and random load disturbances for purely integral ACE control. However, this destabilizing effect is reduced by proportional feedback of ACE.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic generation control","Turbines","Control systems","Frequency","Power system control","Power systems","Optimal control","Automatic control","State-space methods","Error correction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112604/04112627.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampled Data Automatic Generation Control Analysis with Reheat Steam Turbines and Governor Dead-Band Effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampled Data Automatic Generation Control Analysis with Reheat Steam Turbines and Governor Dead-Band Effects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112627/","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled Data Automatic Generation Control Analysis with Reheat Steam Turbines and Governor Dead-Band Effects","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n5-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031107S","chronDate":"May  1984","isNumber":"4112604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"50","articleId":"4112627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4112630,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Extrapolation based on a curve fit to past annual peak loads is currently the most popular manner of accomplishing this forecast. Curve fitting suffers badly from data shifts caused by switching as loads are routinely moved from one substation to another during the course of utility operations. This switching contaminates the data, reducing forecast accuracy. A new regression application reduces error due to these transfers by over an order of magnitude. A key to the usefulness of this method is that the amount of the transfer, and its direction (whether it was to or from a substation), is not a required input. The new technique, aspects of computer implementation of it, and a series of tests showing its advantage over normal multiole regression methods are given.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318713","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1076","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112604/04112630.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Transfer Coupling Regression Curve Fitting for Distribution Load Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1984","displayDocTitle":"Load Transfer Coupling Regression Curve Fitting for Distribution Load Forecasting","publicationDate":"May 1984","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112630/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Transfer Coupling Regression Curve Fitting for Distribution Load Forecasting","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n5-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038967S","chronDate":"May  1984","isNumber":"4112604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4112630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4112648,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

This method has appl ication to fossil generation units capable of burning gas and oil , as well as other problems which result in multiple intersecting cost curves for a particular unit.

There have also been attempts to solve electrical power flow problems with related transportation algorithms. The problems solved using network flow or transportation algorithms are naturally linear, or forced into a linear form, and are therefore also amenable to solution by more general linear programming (LP) techniaues. It has been claimed that specialized network flow algorithms are more efficient than general LP for problems which can be expressed in network flow format. On the other hand the use of general LP is attractive, since a considerable amount of information on its application to power systems problems is available. This paper describes relationships between general LP and network flow algorithms and shows how LP can be made competitive for network problems. Applications to fuel scheduling and contingency analysis are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112704/04112730.pdf","startPage":"1684","endPage":"1691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4112730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Flow Linear Programming Techniques and Their Application to Fuel Scheduling and Contingency Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Fuels","Power system analysis computing","Transportation","Strontium","Scheduling algorithm","Load flow","Power systems","Power engineering and energy","Systems engineering and theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","displayDocTitle":"Network Flow Linear Programming Techniques and Their Application to Fuel Scheduling and Contingency Analysis","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1984","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Flow Linear Programming Techniques and Their Application to Fuel Scheduling and Contingency Analysis","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n7-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052446S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"4112704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"28","articleId":"4112730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4112764,"authors":[{"name":"T.

All the oils showed similar temperature dependence on charging behavior in a near exponential manner.

The charging tendency is attributed to certain polar compounds in trace quantities, most likely surface active agents.

It is shown that with reasonable values of the turbine damping no torsional interactions problem would occur for the cases studied.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1984.318552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1984.318552","startPage":"2352","endPage":"2361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4112770/04112826.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4112770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Hydro Units' Generator-to-Turbine Inertia Ratio on Damping of Subsynchronous Oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Hydro Units' Generator-to-Turbine Inertia Ratio on Damping of Subsynchronous Oscillations","publicationDate":"Aug. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","volume":"PAS-103","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4112826/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Hydro Units' Generator-to-Turbine Inertia Ratio on Damping of Subsynchronous Oscillations","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-103-n8-56.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039716S","chronDate":"Aug.  1984","isNumber":"4112770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"16","articleId":"4112826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":4112854,"authors":[{"name":"Maneck J.

The Telegraphers' Equations are solved with the return stroke vertical and horizontal electric fields as forcing functions. The hori zontal electric fields are calculated from measured or assumed vertical fields and assuned earth conductivities. For a typical return stroke, voltage waveforms are presented for a line of 500 m length and one of 5 km length for the following conditions: earth conductivities between 10-2 mhos/m and 10-5 mhos/m, earth permittivities between \u03b5\u03d2= 15 and \u03b5\u03d2= 3, and lightning ground strike points between 0.2 km and 5.0 km of the line at a variety of positions around the line. Measured voltages on a 460 m test line described in a companion paper are compared with calculated voltage waveforms derived from measured vertical electric fields, in accordance with the developed theory. Calculated waveshapes are found to be in moderately good agreement with the measurements, but calculated magnitudes are about a factor of 4 lower than measured. Possible errors in both theory and measurement are discussed.

The model predicts both the steady state and transient thermal behavior of conductors that are subjected to a step change in current.

In order to obtain simultaneous measurements of different buses it is necessary to synchronize sampling clocks at different locations.

The decision variables to be optimally determined are (i) the locations, sizes and the real-time control of the specified number of ON/OFF switched and fixed capacitors and (ii) the locations and real-time control of the minimum number of voltage regulators. It is shown in this paper (Part I) that the regulator (volt) and the capacitor (var) problem may be treated as two decoupled problems. Part II of this set of three papers, conjoined with Part 1. provides the analytical tools by which optimal solutions for both problems may be determined.

The dc transmission model is solved for the facilities network by obeying both of Kirchhoff's laws, flow conservation at each bus and voltage conservation around each loop. The transportation model is solved for the overloads by obeying only the bus flow conservation law while minimizing a cost objective function.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1985.319049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4113073/04113089.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1985.319049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4113073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Network Planning Using Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4113089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4113089/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Network Planning Using Linear Programming","volume":"PAS-104","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Network Planning Using Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-104-n2-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036281S","chronDate":"Feb.  1985","isNumber":"4113073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"199","articleId":"4113089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4113094,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This combination makes it economical to apply SVC to improve transient stability. In this paper another proposal is concerned with the conceivable installation of SVC to damp oscillations of power systems. The so-called \"Reset Filters\" is applied to the voltage detective circuit of SVC. Because of its leading characteristic, it produces a damping effect on the power system. The economy and effectiveness of the combination type SVC equipped with Reset Filter is illustrated to improve stability of the power system both analytically and quantitatively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4113211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1985.319245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4113211/04113243.pdf","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1410","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1985.319245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Application of Static Var Compensators to Damp Oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1985","displayDocTitle":"Effective Application of Static Var Compensators to Damp Oscillations","volume":"PAS-104","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1985","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4113243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Application of Static Var Compensators to Damp Oscillations","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-104-n6-30.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033733S","chronDate":"June  1985","isNumber":"4113211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4113243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4113245,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Pahwa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Pahwa","id":"37282628600"},{"name":"C.

The arcing fault detector identifies many ground faults which exhibit current too low to be picked up by overcurrent devices. The digital overcurrent relay provides several enhancements over electromechanical relays. The system also demonstrates some of the advantages of computer automation of distribution protective devices by providing remote monitoring, data retrieval and adjustment of settings. These features of the Feeder Protection and Monitoring System were demonstrated during the staged fault tests.

The machine models used here are suited for such steady state dynamic performance. The reason these authors refer to the present modeling approach as a \"steady state dynamic\" analysis method is that electronic switching is continuously taking place throughout the normal operation, hence network modeling must be on an instantaneous basis. Thus time domain models are required as will be described below. An automatic formulation of the state equations, an explicit integration routine, and control logic needed to impose electronic switching and/or fault conditions were used in the dynamic simulation program. The general modeling description and its verification, using as an example a stationary armature electronically commutated dc machine system, are included for verification of the validity of the modeling approach. The modeling techniques of the dynamic simulation program were then applied to an example rotating armature electronically commutated dc machine system of the type used in modern brushless systems for field excitation of large turbine generators.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4113326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1985.318801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4113326/04113368.pdf","startPage":"2214","endPage":"2222","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1985.318801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Formulation of Models for Simulation of the Dynamic Performance of Electronically Commutated DC Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Formulation of Models for Simulation of the Dynamic Performance of Electronically Commutated DC Machines","volume":"PAS-104","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4113368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Formulation of Models for Simulation of the Dynamic Performance of Electronically Commutated DC Machines","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-104-n8-40.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029306S","chronDate":"Aug.  1985","isNumber":"4113326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"23","articleId":"4113368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4113372,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Ozawa","affiliation":["Hitachi and Limited, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ozawa","id":"37288919000"},{"name":"Eiichi Ohsaki","affiliation":["Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiichi","lastName":"Ohsaki","id":"37300458800"},{"name":"Masaru Ishii","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaru","lastName":"Ishii","id":"37291631100"},{"name":"Soji Kojima","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Soji","lastName":"Kojima","id":"37287601000"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ishihara","affiliation":["Setsunan University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ishihara","id":"37300620800"},{"name":"Teruya Kouno","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruya","lastName":"Kouno","id":"37300315800"},{"name":"Tatsuo Kawamura","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuo","lastName":"Kawamura","id":"37288448100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4113372","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lightning","Surges","Substations","Insulation","Conductors","Flashover","EMTP","Wires","Voltage","Optical reflection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4113372","abstract":"Analysis of back flashover lightning surges coming into a substation is important to understanding of substation insulation co-ordination.

Some of these techniques have been tested in on-site applications and others have been evaluated using simulation techniques. This paper describes a theoretical basis, and supporting experimental evidence from tests performed at a power plant, for tuning power system stabilizers using frequency response techniques. By using the method described in this paper, the power system analyst is able to obtain an approximate measure of the amount of damping that can be expected from the stabilizer in damping out tie- line power oscillations. The tests were conducted on the inter- tie between the Alberta and British Columbia Hydro power pools. Test results indicated a direct correlation between the improvement in the electric power damping as observed by field tests and that predicted by theoretical means. Although the method suggested in this paper has general application to power system stabilization for local mode damping and inter- tie damping it was applied to the specific case where the tie- line power was used as a feedback signal to the stabilizer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Response Methods for Tuning Stabilizers to Damp out Tie-Line Power Oscillations: Theory and Field-Test Results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1979.319463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4113646/04113653.pdf","startPage":"1509","endPage":"1515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1979.319463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4113646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4113653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4113653/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Response Methods for Tuning Stabilizers to Damp out Tie-Line Power Oscillations: Theory and Field-Test Results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-98","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Response Methods for Tuning Stabilizers to Damp out Tie-Line Power Oscillations: Theory and Field-Test Results","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-98-n5-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065749S","chronDate":"Sept.  1979","isNumber":"4113646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"29","articleId":"4113653","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4113659,"authors":[{"name":"G Irisarri","affiliation":["American Electric Power Service Corporation, NY, USA"],"firstName":"G","lastName":"Irisarri","id":"37300328700"},{"name":"D.

At low arc power there is a correspondance between the pressure amplitude and the rate of change of the power which is not true for high arc power due to absorption. However, the pressure is very large and should be taken into account in the design of substations.

This method begins with treating the system or a piece of it (a float) as electrically rigid and then gradually relaxing the results tier by tier to account for the actual flexibility of the transmission. The diagonally dominant or dispersive nature of the power system is utilized. Speed of computation is derived from this exploitation of the structure of the problem which also allows explicit solutions for the intermediate steps.

However, at the present time, it is not clear which particular modes of control will best exploit the capabilities of DAC. Homeostatic Utility Control is an overall concept which tries to maintain an internal equilibrium between supply and demand. Equilibrating forces are obtained over longer time scales (5 minutes and up) by economic principles through an Energy Marketplace using time-varying spot prices. Faster supply-demand balancing is obtained by employing \"governor-type\" action on certain types of loads using a Frequency Adaptive Power Energy Rescheduler (FAPER) to assist or even replace conventional turbine-governed systems and spinning reserve. Conventional metering is replaced by a Marketing Interface to Customer (MIC) which, in addition to measuring power usage, multiplies that usage by posted price and records total cost. Customers retain the freedom to select their consumption patterns. Homeostatic control is a new, untried concept. It is discussed in this paper because its great potential makes it a vehicle for interesting discussions of where the future may actually evolve.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4113873/04113911.pdf","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1980.319745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1980.319745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4113873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4113911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Homeostatic Utility Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic control","Storage automation","Costs","Home automation","Automatic generation control","Control systems","Power system control","Power systems","Dispersion","Distributed power generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4113911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","displayDocTitle":"Homeostatic Utility Control","volume":"PAS-99","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1980","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Homeostatic Utility Control","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-99-n3-37.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073825S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"4113873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"253","articleId":"4113911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4113920,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The load flow program utilitizes a new approach to load modeling that recognizes the key load components and their voltage sensitive characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1980.319557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4113933/04113940.pdf","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1980.319557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4113933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of Energy Losses in a Distribution System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4113940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4113940/","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of Energy Losses in a Distribution System","volume":"PAS-99","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of Energy Losses in a Distribution System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-99-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096062S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"4113933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"100","articleId":"4113940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4113953,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Also, over the past 12-20 years, the efficiencies of electric motors under 10 kW (~15 hp) have degraded significantly, though the trend toward lower efficiencies appears to be reversing. Very substantial energy savings are possible in lightly loaded induction motors by means of controlling the applied voltage. Tests are conducted on a fractional horse-power motor, and several voltage control arrangements consisting of SCRs are compared in their ability to improve the motor efficiency, and in terms of the amount of harmonic currents generated.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1980.319570","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4113933/04113953.pdf","startPage":"1466","endPage":"1471","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1980.319570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4113933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement in Energy Efficiency of Induction Motors by Means of Voltage Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4113953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","displayDocTitle":"Improvement in Energy Efficiency of Induction Motors by Means of Voltage Control","volume":"PAS-99","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"July 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement in Energy Efficiency of Induction Motors by Means of Voltage Control","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-99-n4-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026054S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"4113933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"48","articleId":"4113953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4113957,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Over the years, every conceptual shift in wireless technology has been characterized as a generational change. Third generation includes wideband mobile multimedia networks and broadband mixed wireless systems. The mobile systems support variable data rates depending on demand and the level of mobility. Typically 144 kb/s is supported for full vehicular mobility and higher bandwidths for pedestrian levels of mobility. Switched packet radio techniques and wideband CDMA-like systems (as the physical channel is) rather than assigned physical channel schemes (referred to as circuit switched) are required to support this bandwidth-on-demand environment. There are two essential concepts beyond 3G. One of these is the provision of data transmission at rates of 100 Mb/s while mobile and 1 Gb/s while stationary.

The STBC scheme can not be directly applicable to the UW-SC system, because its transmit sequence is reversed in the time-domain. To cope with this problem, we first design a new transmit sequence to fulfill the theorem of circular convolution, and propose a new corresponding receiver structure to have the transmit diversity.

The first path employs the regular OFDM algorithm. The second path uses the conjugate transmission of the first path. The combination of both paths forms a conjugate ICI cancellation scheme at the receiver. This conjugate cancellation (CC) scheme provides (1) a high signal to interference power ratio (SIR) in the presence of small frequency offsets (50 dB and 33 dB higher than that of the regular OFDM and linear self-cancellation algorithms (Y.

Arpacioglu and Z.J. Haas, (2004) on the capacity of single-user-detection based wireless networks, and we determine the implications of our results on the scalability of such networks. In particular, we consider a wireless network of N nodes that are equipped with isotropic antennas. The nodes are stationary or moving arbitrarily in a network domain of an arbitrary one, two, or three dimensional shape, as opposed to the two dimensional circular domain in O. Arpacioglu and Z.J. Haas, (2004). In this arbitrary dimensional setting, we derive bounds on the per node end-to-end throughput capacity and the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions whose SINRs exceed a given threshold. We derive these bounds with both the bounded propagation model in O. Arpacioglu and Z.J. Haas, (2004) and a large class of bounded propagation models, which we refer to as the general propagation model. Our results show that with the general propagation model, the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions, whose SINRs exceed the threshold has an upper bound that does not depend on N, and the per node end-to-end throughput capacity is O(1/N) for a large class of wireless networks. Moreover, we establish several required conditions for scalability. These conditions show that, for any propagation model, to achieve a desired per node end-to-end throughput as N grows, it is necessary to keep the average source-to-destination hop count bounded. Also, for the particular propagation model of O. Arpacioglu and Z.J. Haas, (2004), we show that the size of the network domain must grow with N at a rate that depends on the dimension of the network domain and the path loss exponent","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","volume":"6","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9269275","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4114242/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the scalability and capacity of single-user-detection based wireless networks with isotropic antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the scalability and capacity of single-user-detection based wireless networks with isotropic antennas","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_08.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079332S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4114244,"authors":[{"name":"Youngwook Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Youngwook","lastName":"Ko","id":"37291736800"},{"name":"Qian Ma","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Ma","id":"37266959500"},{"name":"Cihan Tepedelenlioglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Cihan","lastName":"Tepedelenlioglu","id":"38228968600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4114244","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Feedback","Delay","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Block codes","Adaptive systems","Diversity methods","Closed-form solution","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","array signal processing","block codes","diversity reception","error statistics","feedback","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","orthogonal STBC","outdated channel feedback","adaptive orthogonal space time block coding","single user setup","multiuser diversity systems","adaptive modulation","feedback delay","closed-form expressions","spectral efficiency","average BER","reduced diversity advantage","transmit antennas","channel-hardening effect"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114244","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","abstract":"We compare the achievable performance of adaptive beamforming (A-BF) and adaptive orthogonal space time block coding (A-OSTBC) with outdated channel feedback.

Using closed-form expressions for spectral efficiency and average BER of a multiuser diversity system derived in this paper, we prove that the A-BF scheme outperforms the A-OSTBC scheme with no feedback delay. However, when the feedback delay is large, the A-OSTBC scheme achieves better performance due to the reduced diversity advantage of A-BF. We observe that more transmit antennas bring higher spectral efficiency for BF. With small feedback delay, this becomes inverted using OSTBC, due to the effect of channel-hardening.

Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can decrease feedback information by a factor of 1/M while retaining performance comparable to the full feedback case, which requires M bits per subcarrier","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4095379/04114249.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4095379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint feedback reduction scheme using delta modulation for dynamic channel allocation in OFDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Delta modulation","Channel allocation","Degradation","Bit error rate","Performance loss","Frequency conversion","Transmitters","Signal processing","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","delta modulation","error statistics","feedback","frequency division multiple access","greedy algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint feedback reduction scheme","delta modulation","dynamic channel allocation","OFDMA systems","channel gain","reduced feedback information","performance degradation","bit error rate","modified amplitude craving greedy method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"A joint feedback reduction scheme using delta modulation for dynamic channel allocation in OFDMA systems","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4114249/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9269282","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint feedback reduction scheme using delta modulation for dynamic channel allocation in OFDMA systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_46.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042746S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4114250,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Lau","affiliation":["Dept of EEE, University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Lau","id":"37278592300"},{"name":"Tianyu Wu","affiliation":["Dept of EEE, University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290007300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4114250","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":126},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","MIMO","Transmitters","Distortion measurement","Design optimization","Fading","Vector quantization","Algorithm design and analysis","Throughput","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","fading channels","MIMO communication","modulation","optimisation","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel encoding rates","discrete modulation adaptation design","MIMO links","slow fading channels","channel state information","MIMO transmitter","finite combinations","modulation constellation levels","control overhead","packet transmission","discrete transmission modes","information theoretical framework","optimization problem","classical vector quantization problem","modified distortion measure"]}],"abstract":"It is well-known that MIMO links in slow fading channels can benefit significantly through rate and power adaptations when there is knowledge of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT).

In this paper, we shall address various practical MIMO adaptation design issues associated with discrete transmission modes. We propose a systematic design framework to address the MIMO adaptation design based on information theoretical framework. The design problem is cast into an optimization problem similar to the classical vector quantization problem with a modified distortion measure. As an illustration, we apply the design framework to a 2 times 2 MIMO link and compare the goodput performance with the optimal performance predicted by the theory.

Recent academic studies have shown that in addition to coverage improvements, DAS can also have potential advantages such as reduced power and increased system capacity in a single cell environment. This paper analytically quantifies downlink capacity of multicell DAS for two different transmission strategies: selection diversity (where just one or two of the distributed antennas are used) and blanket transmission (where all antennas in the cell broadcast data). Simple repeaters are a special case of our analysis. A generalized information theoretic analysis is provided to illuminate the fundamental limits of such systems in the cellular context. The results show that DAS reduces other-cell interference in a multicell environment and hence significantly improves capacity (by about 2x), with particularly large improvements for users near cell boundaries. Less obviously, from a communication theory standpoint, it is shown that selection diversity is preferable to blanket transmission in terms of achievable ergodic capacity. For blanket transmission, we show that the optimal transmission strategy is just phase steering due to the per antenna module power constraints in DAS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114255/","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4114255/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9269287","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Downlink performance and capacity of distributed antenna systems in a multicell environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink performance and capacity of distributed antenna systems in a multicell environment","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_69.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053391S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"453","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4114258,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4095379/4114258/4114258-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaofeng Wang received the B.S. degree in electronics from Wuhan University, China, in 1991, the M.E. degree in telecommunications engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Victoria, Canada, in 2002.

In the heart of the new approach is a novel space-time orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. The proposed space-time OFDM modulator translates a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel into a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel without the loss of system freedom (the available diversity gain). This translation simplifies code design as compared to that in the conventional MIMO OFDM approach. Instead of more complicated space-time codes, codes that are designed for single-input fading channels can be used with the proposed space-time modulation. For bandwidth-efficient applications, a channel multiplexing scheme is developed to work with the space-time modulator. Unlike the conventional spatial multiplexing schemes, an arbitrary number of data streams can be created and each layer occupies all the transmit antennas all the time. As a result, all the available degrees of freedom are preserved for each layer and a full range of optimal tradeoffs between data rate and reliability is possible.

Unlike the conventional approach in which isolated pilot tones are used, we cluster two pilot tones together as a group and these tone groups are equally spaced along the subcarrier axis. The pilot sequence of each group is carefully designed, in which the pilot symbol on the left side in each cluster is made antipodal to the one on the right. The performance in terms of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be significantly improved by the proposed scheme. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the clustered pilot tones can give a substantially lower variance of CFO estimate than that of the isolated pilot tones. For a given CFO, it demonstrates that the variance of the estimate can be reduced by 3 - 14 dB.

In contrast to other schemes, our receiver is designed for imperfect channel state information and incorporates the statistics of the channel estimation error. In particular, we suggest an error model for data transmission that takes the influence from the data symbols on the estimation noise into account. We derive the optimum detection rule for the considered error model according to the maximum likelihood criterion and verify that the covariance matrix of the estimation noise depends on the actual transmitted data symbols. Motivated by this result, we propose a realizable receiver structure adopting the turbo principle that exploits the data-dependency of the covariance matrix of the estimation noise. The proposed scheme outperforms conventional receivers that neglect the exact statistics of the estimation noise. The core of our receiver is a soft-input soft-output block equalizer based on constrained minimum variance filter design. We assess the performance of the proposed turbo equalization scheme for block Rayleigh fading channels, applying both one-shot training-based channel estimation and iterative data-aided channel estimation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved block equalization scheme for uncertain channel estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.04816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4095379/04114264.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.04816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4095379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An improved block equalization scheme for uncertain channel estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4114264/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9269296","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved block equalization scheme for uncertain channel estimation","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093845S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":4114266,"authors":[{"name":"Tan-jan Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4095379/4114266/4114266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tan-Jan Ho received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto in 1997.

This problem is important in the design of a receiver over multipath time-varying fading channels. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. The first one is a multiple-model framework for modeling the channel, composed of a set of known first- and second-order auto-regressive models (AR(i), i = 1,2) with the transitions between models obeying a Markov chain. Each AR model assumes a velocity sub-range of mobile users, and the set covers the range of possible dynamics of the time-varying fading channel. The second contribution is the adaptation of the known interacting multiple-model (EMM) estimation algorithm for channel tracking based on the above modeling framework. This tracking solution in combination with Kalman-based symbol detector leads to a feasible receiver architecture for attaining satisfactory performance","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4095379/04114266.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4095379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking of dispersive DS-CDMA channels: an AR-embedded modified interacting multiple-model approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Degradation","Gaussian noise","Dynamic range","Detectors","Bandwidth","Time varying systems","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","code division multiple access","fading channels","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","Kalman filters","Markov processes","mobile radio","multipath channels","spread spectrum communication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersive DS-CDMA channels","interacting multiple-model approach","channel tracking problem","direct-sequence code division multiple-access","Gaussian noise","multipath time-varying fading channels","auto-regressive models","Markov chain","mobile users","Kalman-based symbol detector","receiver architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"Tracking of dispersive DS-CDMA channels: an AR-embedded modified interacting multiple-model approach","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4114266/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9269298","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking of dispersive DS-CDMA channels: an AR-embedded modified interacting multiple-model approach","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07443S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4114267,"authors":[{"name":"Rodolfo Feick","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4095379/4114267/4114267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rodolfo Feick (S'71-M'76-SM'95) obtained the degree of Ingeniero Civil Electr\u00f3nico at Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Valpara\u00edso Chile in 1970 and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh in 1975.","He has been with the Department of Electronics Engineering at Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda since 1975, where he is the head of the telecommunications area.

In particular, a cross-layer design is proposed for the packet scheduling on a forward link that implements adaptive coding and modulation (ACM). A cross-layer approach is considered whereby the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers share knowledge of the channel dynamics in presence of ACM. Transmission power and symbol rate are assumed to be constant, and hence the bit rate is time and space dependant according to the channel conditions. An architecture is proposed which relies on the physical characteristics of the Ka-band satellite propagation channel and the definition of \"correlated areas\". The stable throughput region has been derived assuming full-queue traffic conditions. Moreover, the proposed architecture is simple but flexible enough to allow the implementation of different scheduling policies like the proportionally fair or opportunistic ones. Finally, a new time-fair policy appropriate for wet seasons is proposed. It has the property of isolating users in clear-sky conditions from the effects of the reduced transmission rate experienced by users under a rain fade","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4114275/","accessionNumber":"9269307","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer packet scheduler design of a multibeam broadband satellite system with adaptive coding and modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer packet scheduler design of a multibeam broadband satellite system with adaptive coding and modulation","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_248.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056506S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4114276,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassane Aniba","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4095379/4114276/4114276-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ghassane Aniba (S'04) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in telecommunication engineering from the Institut National des Postes et Telecommunications (INPT), Rabat, Morocco, in 2002.

The main important characteristic of an optimal scheduler is to maximize throughput while servicing users in a fair manner. Herein, we formulate MIMO scheduling as a generalized assignment problem (GAP) and propose a general solution for the GAP, namely, a cross-layer MIMO scheduler (CMS), which uses a novel adaptive proportional fairness (APF) mapping approach in conjunction with a new fast transmit antenna selection (FTAS) technique, to determine the set of users to transmit to and the antenna over which the data associated to each user should be transmitted. The proposed scheduler is applied for packet transmission in high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), taking advantage of the use of adaptive modulation and coding while coping with the constraints on the maximum number of simultaneous codes a user equipment can support, the limited uplink signalling, and the absence of fast power control.

For a MIMO channel which has multiple orthonormal vectors as channel spatial information, we exploit the geometrical structure of orthonormality while quantizing the spatial information matrix. The parameterization is of two types: one is in terms of a set of unit-norm vectors with different lengths, and the other is in terms of a minimal number of scalar parameters. These parameters are shown to be independent for the i.i.d. flat-fading Rayleigh channel, facilitating efficient quantization. In the first scheme, each of the unit-norm vectors is independently quantized with a finite number of bits using an optimal vector quantization (VQ) technique. Bit allocation is needed between the vectors, and the optimum bit allocation depends on the operating SNR of the system. In the second scheme, the scalar parameters are quantized. In slowly time-varying channels, the scalar parameters are also found to be smoothly changing over time, leading to the development of a simple quantization and feedback method using adaptive delta modulation. The results show that the proposed feedback scheme has a channel tracking feature and achieves a capacity very close to perfect feedback with a reasonable feedback rate","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4095379/04114278.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4095379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient feedback methods for MIMO channels based on parameterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114278/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient feedback methods for MIMO channels based on parameterization","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9269310","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4114278/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient feedback methods for MIMO channels based on parameterization","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09201S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4114280,"authors":[{"name":"Justin S.

First, the detection problem is formulated as an inference problem in a graphical model that models a hybrid dynamic system with both continuous and discrete variables. Then, based on the expectation propagation (EP) framework, we develop a smoothing algorithm to address the inference problem and visualize this algorithm using factor graphs. As a generalization of loopy belief propagation, EP efficiently approximates Bayesian estimation by iteratively propagating information between different nodes in the graphical model and projecting the posterior distributions into the exponential family. We use window-based EP smoothing for online estimation as in the signal detection problem. Window-based EP smoothing achieves accuracy similar to that obtained by batch EP smoothing, as shown in our simulations, while reducing delay time. Compared to sequential Monte Carlo filters and smoothers, the new method has lower computational complexity since it makes analytically deterministic approximation instead of Monte Carlo approximations. Our simulations demonstrate that the new receiver achieves accurate detection without the aid of any training symbols or decision feedbacks. Furthermore, the new receiver achieves accuracy comparable to that achieved by sequential Monte Carlo methods, but with less than one-tenth computational cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4095379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4095379/04114285.pdf","startPage":"348","endPage":"355","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Window-based expectation propagation for adaptive signal detection in flat-fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Window-based expectation propagation for adaptive signal detection in flat-fading channels","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4114285/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9269317","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Window-based expectation propagation for adaptive signal detection in flat-fading channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0701_348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063411S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4095379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4095379","articleId":"4114285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4114324,"authors":[{"name":"Sameer M.

Carrier sense multiple-access approaches produce excessive transmission collisions at high vehicle densities and are vulnerable to a variety of denial of service (DoS) attacks.

This paper presents a novel adaptation of the explicit time slot allocation protocols for IVC networks. The protocol adaptive space-division multiplexing (ASDM) requires no control messages, provides protection against a range of DoS attacks, significantly improves bandwidth utilization, and automatically adjusts the time slot allocation in response to changes in vehicle densities. This paper demonstrates the need for and the effectiveness of this new protocol.

While car drivers are already assisted by advanced guidance and navigation facilities, continuous on-trip assistance for multimodal travelers is still in its infancy. Especially when it comes to situations of modal change, travelers get discouraged by the increased complexity and the lack of adequate information and guidance. Thus, the goal of our research over the past three years has been to integrate existing information systems and to design and implement the prototype of a digital personal travel companion for multimodal travelers.

However, the supply voltage and power consumption of the RF front-end and analog sections do not scale in a similar fashion. In fact, in many state-of-the-art communication transceivers, RF and analog sections can consume more energy compared to the digital part. In this paper, first, a system level energy model for all the components in the RF and analog front-end is presented. Next, the RF and analog front-end energy consumption and communication quality of three representative systems are analyzed: a single user point-to-point wireless data communication system, a multi-user code division multiple access (CDMA)-based system and a receive-only video distribution system. For the single user system, the effect of occupied signal bandwidth, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), symbol rate, constellation size, and pulse-shaping filter roll-off factor is analyzed; for the CDMA-based multi-user system, the effect of the number of users in the cell and multiple access interference (MAI) along with the PAR and filter roll-off factor is studied; for the receive-only system, the effect of 1/f noise for direct-conversion receiver and the effect of IF frequency for low-IF architecture on the RF front-end power consumption is analyzed.

Based on the proposed architectures, a (8176, 7154) Euclidian geometry-based QC-LDPC code decoder is implemented on Xilinx field programmable gate array (FPGA) Virtex-II 6000, where an efficient nonuniform quantization scheme is employed to reduce the size of memories storing soft messages.

This paper presents a system for computing the brachial artery diameter in real-time by analyzing B-mode ultrasound images. The method is based on a robust edge detection algorithm which is used to automatically locate the two walls of the vessel. The measure of the diameter is obtained with subpixel precision and with a temporal resolution of 25 samples/s, so that the small dilations induced by the cardiac cycle can also be retrieved. The algorithm is implemented on a standalone video processing board which acquires the analog video signal from the ultrasound equipment. Results are shown in real-time on a graphical user interface. The system was tested both on synthetic ultrasound images and in clinical studies of flow-mediated dilation.

Our study aims to provide a good approximate solution to this specific problem with the makespan minimization (Cmax) as the objective function. Considering, the success of the genetic algorithms developed for scheduling problems, we apply this metaheuristic to tackle with this problem. We develop a genetic algorithm with a new crossover operator which is a combination between the SJOX crossover operator proposed by Ruiz and Maroto [1] and the NXO crossover operator proposed by Oguz and Ercan [2]. The design of our genetic algorithm is different compared to the classical structure of the genetic algorithm especially in the encoding of solutions. For the calibration of our metaheuristic's parameters, we conduct several experimental designs. Our algorithm is tested with benchmark problems presented in [3]. The results show that the proposed genetic algorithm is an efficient approach for solving the multiprocessor flow shop problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114666/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9398041","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4114666/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Genetic Algorithm in the Multiprocessor Flow Shop to Minimize the Makespan","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Genetic Algorithm in the Multiprocessor Flow Shop to Minimize the Makespan","confLoc":"Troyes, France","sourcePdf":"ICSSSM-2-73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064028S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4114390","isNumber":"4114593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4114390","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4114593","articleId":"4114666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4114733,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Hui","affiliation":["College of Economic and Management, Dalian Maritime University, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Hui","id":"37287514400"},{"name":"Fu Ce","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, China"],"firstName":"Fu","lastName":"Ce","id":"37297746300"},{"name":"Xie Yiwu","firstName":"Xie","lastName":"Yiwu","id":"37294641300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0451-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0450-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-1890"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-1904"}],"articleNumber":"4114733","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114733","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Sampling methods","Analog-digital conversion","Distortion","Chaotic communication","Software radio","Educational institutions","Economic forecasting","Engineering management","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter","communication system","manufacturing process","digital signal processing","T-model neural network","chaotic neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["A/D Conversion","Software Radio","Chaotic Neural Network","Adaptive Filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSSSM.2006.320787","pdfPath":"/iel5/4114390/4114593/04114733.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSSM.2006.320787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of Converter System Based on Neural Network","abstract":"The behavior of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) strongly affects the global performance of the modern communication systems in terms of metrological uncertainty Due to errors in the manufacturing process, all ADCs in a time interleaved ADC system are not exactly identical. It means that gain and offset mismatch errors are introduced in the digital signal processing. These errors cause distortion in the sampled signal. In this paper we present a method based on T-model neural network for compensation of the mismatch errors. The compensation can be working while the ADCs are still running. The method is also adaptive to slow changes of the errors parameters. Combining with prediction of signal based on chaotic neural network, we can reach obvious improvement for ADC system and save a large amount of calculating time.

As a result, a gain and gain-bandwidth product performance similar to that of an amplifier using a gate-driven approach is obtained.

Emerging state-of-the-art switching supplies, in fact, are now exploring ways to use this sensed-current information to improve transient response, power efficiency, and compensation performance by appropriately self-adjusting, on the fly, frequency, inductor ripple current, switching configuration (e.g., synchronous to/from asynchronous), and other operating parameters. The discontinuous, non-integrated, and inaccurate nature of existing lossless current-sensing schemes, however, impedes their widespread adoption, and lossy solutions are not acceptable. Lossless, filter-based techniques are continuous, but inaccurate when integrated on-chip because of the inherent mismatches between the filter and the power inductor. The proposed G\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</sub>\n-C filter-based, fully integrated current-sensing CMOS scheme circumvents this accuracy limitation by introducing a self-learning sequence to start-up and power-on-reset. During these seldom-occurring events, the gain and bandwidth of the internal filter are matched to the response of the power inductor and its equivalent series resistance (ESR), effectively measuring their values. A 0.5 mum CMOS realization of the proposed scheme was fabricated and applied to a current-mode buck switching supply, achieving overall DC and AC current-gain errors of 8% and 9%, respectively, at 0.8 A DC load and 0.2 A ripple currents for 3.5 muH-14 muH inductors with ESRs ranging from 48 mOmega to 384 mOmega (other lossless, state-of-the-art solutions achieve 20%-40% error, and only when the nominal specifications of the power MOSFET and/or inductor are known). Since the self-learning sequence is non-recurring, the power losses associated with the foregoing solution are minimal, translating to a 2.6% power efficiency savings when compared to the more traditional but accurate series-sense resistor (e.g., 50 mOmega) technique.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.891721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114741","startPage":"665","endPage":"679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4114741/04114749.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Accurate, Continuous, and Lossless Self-Learning CMOS Current-Sensing Scheme for Inductor-Based DC-DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4114749/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Accurate, Continuous, and Lossless Self-Learning CMOS Current-Sensing Scheme for Inductor-Based DC-DC Converters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9370636","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Accurate, Continuous, and Lossless Self-Learning CMOS Current-Sensing Scheme for Inductor-Based DC-DC Converters","sourcePdf":"42jssc03-forghanizadeh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076659S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4114741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4114741","articleId":"4114749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4114751,"authors":[{"name":"Ankush Goel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Electrophysics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4114741/4114751/4114751-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ankush Goel (S'05) received the B.Tech. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Chennai, India, and the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

These sub-elements having opposite error magnitudes are grouped together to form matched elements thus permitting an accurate multi-bit MDAC to be created without using an explicit trimming network. A random search algorithm enables the self-configuration process by quickly regrouping the sub-elements to reduce the spread between the reconstructed elements. The proposed state machine based permutation algorithm allows near unique permutations of the sub-elements and achieves a near unity state repetition ratio with a simple hardware implementation. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) system is designed with the self-configuration algorithm contained in the same die, and improvement in capacitor matching is demonstrated after the self-configuration process.

A linearity error smaller than 3.1%, a sensitivity dynamic range of 78.8 (37.9 dB) with the largest sensitivity of S = 890 mV/muW at 660 nm, an offset voltage smaller than 0.53 mV, a largest maximum power consumption of only 3.2 mW, a small-signal frequency bandwidth up to 189 MHz, a large-signal rise time/fall time down to 3.7 ns/3.3 ns, and an output noise level down to -77.8 dBm (for a frequency of 50 MHz and a resolution bandwidth of 30 kHz) are achieved.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.891720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4114741/04114767.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.891720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power BiCMOS Optical Receiver With Voltage-Controlled Transimpedance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114767/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power BiCMOS Optical Receiver With Voltage-Controlled Transimpedance","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9370650","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4114767/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power BiCMOS Optical Receiver With Voltage-Controlled Transimpedance","sourcePdf":"42jssc03-tadic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107343S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4114741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4114741","articleId":"4114767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4114772,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastien Amiot","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Caen, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/4114770/4114772/4114772-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sebastien Amiot was born in France in 1975.

We propose two techniques to achieve the fast start-up equalization without an error propagation. The first one is a channel estimation scheme, which consists of a tap-selected correlation and a modified least-mean-square algorithm, to estimate accurately long and complex channels. The second one is a general training DFE (GT-DFE) to overcome the shortage of a training sequence in the VSB signal. The GT-DFE calculates the coefficients of the DFE prior to the equalization with the knowledge of the channel estimation, reference tap (symbol timing of DFE) and its position, i.e., decision delay, in the feedforward filter (FFF). Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation scheme provides a reliable performance comparable to that of conventional schemes. It is also shown that a GT-DFE-based DFE provides 7dB~9 dB higher start-up signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as compared to the DFE without the GT-DFE in severe channels. Moreover, the GT-DFE-based DFE provides a faster convergence speed as much as 2.4times10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n~6times10 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n symbols to converge within 1 dB of the final SINR as compared to the DFE without the GT-DFE","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2006.887171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114774","startPage":"38","endPage":"47","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4114774/04114775.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2006.887171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Start-Up Decision Feedback Equalizer Based on Channel Estimation for 8VSB DTV System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Channel estimation","Digital TV","Signal to noise ratio","Robustness","Timing","Delay estimation","Filters","Field-flow fractionation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation theory","decision feedback equalisers","digital television","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["start-up decision feedback equalizer","channel estimation","8VSB DTV system","eight-level vestigial sideband digital television","tap-selected correlation","least-mean-square algorithm","feedforward filter","FFF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","decision feedback equalizers","digital TV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Fast Start-Up Decision Feedback Equalizer Based on Channel Estimation for 8VSB DTV System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4114775/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9446993","publicationDate":"March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Start-Up Decision Feedback Equalizer Based on Channel Estimation for 8VSB DTV System","sourcePdf":"53tbc01-baek-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063096S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4114774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4114774","articleId":"4114775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4114777,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["Department of E&E,State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai","id":"37270328400"},{"name":"Zhi-xing Yang","affiliation":["Department of E&E,State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-xing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280277800"},{"name":"Chang-yong Pan","affiliation":["Department of E&E,State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chang-yong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37280267400"},{"name":"Shi-gang Tang","affiliation":["Department of E&E,State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shi-gang","lastName":"Tang","id":"37286739400"},{"name":"Tao-tao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of E&E,State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao-tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288850700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"4114777","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":750},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on LUT Based Predistortion Method for HPA with Memory","abstract":"Most existing methods for HPA predistortion with memory effects are based on polynomial or indirect learning structures.

In the past, Mobile TV was often associated with broadcast transmission. However, unicast technology is sufficient in many cases, especially since mobile users prefer to access content on-demand, rather than following a fixed schedule. In this paper we will focus on 3G mobile networks, which have been primarily optimized for unicast services. Based on a traffic model we will discuss the capacity limits of 3G networks for unicast distribution of Mobile TV. From the results it can be concluded that the capacity is sufficient for many scenarios. In order to address scenarios in which broadcast is a more appropriate technology, 3GPP has defined a broadcast extension, called Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS). MBMS introduces shared radio broadcast bearers and has thus the capabilities of a real broadcasting technology. We will give a short overview about MBMS including a discussion on MBMS capacity. Since MBMS is primarily a new transport technology, additional application and service layer technologies are required, like electronic service guide and service protection. These mechanisms are standardized by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and are favorably combined with MBMS or 3G unicast distribution in order to create complete end-to-end solutions. In order to optimize a system for delivery of broadcast services over 3G networks, the advantages of broadcast and unicast should be combined. We argue that hybrid unicast-broadcast delivery offers the best system resource usage and also the best user experience, and is thus favorable not only for broadcast delivery in 3G networks, but actually also for non-cellular broadcast systems like DVB-H or DMB","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2007.891711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4114770/04114796.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2007.891711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delivery of Broadcast Services in 3G Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114796/","displayDocTitle":"Delivery of Broadcast Services in 3G Networks","volume":"53","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9347219","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4114796/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delivery of Broadcast Services in 3G Networks","sourcePdf":"53tbc01-hartung-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060011S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4114770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4114770","articleId":"4114796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4114799,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungtae Kang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/4114770/4114799/4114799-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyungtae Kang received B.S.

By varying the radio channel conditions, RS coding scheme and other system parameters, we determined energy-efficient cache configurations and operating ranges for each RS encoding scheme, corresponding to given levels of service quality in a video application.

codec prediction mechanisms. The H.264/AVC standard suggests some new error-resilient features to enable reliable transmission of compressed video signal over lossy packet networks. Two of those new features are the Redundant Slices and the Flexible Macro-Block Ordering (FMO). In this paper we propose a new error-resilient scheme which merges the H.264/AVC FMO feature with a new technique for dynamic allocation of redundant slices depending on the wireless channel fading parameters. We suggest using a unique smart dynamic redundant slices allocation scheme which considers the dynamic wireless channel parameters rather than using the classical standard static allocation. The proposed redundant slice allocation algorithm is based on both Average Fade Duration (AFD), and Level Cross Rate (LCR) channel's characteristics. Moreover, we propose a new Explicit Spiral-Interleaved (ESI) flexible macroblocks ordering technique, which outperforms all other FMO types. The new ESI ordering results in effective error scattering which maximize the number of correctly received macroblocks located around corrupted macroblocks, leading to better error concealment. The proposed scheme greatly improves video transmission quality over lossy wireless transmission channels. Simulations results for wireless channel characterized by Rayleigh fading indicate that the proposed method improves the standard static allocation of redundant slices in terms of PSNR by about 2.5dB. Performance evaluations show that our approach is especially suited for applications such as video conferencing and mobile TV, where typically a specific main important Region of Interest should be more carefully protected","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4114770/04114801.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Error-Resilient Scheme Based on FMO and Dynamic Redundant Slices Allocation for Wireless Video Transmission","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2006.889694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2006.889694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"New Error-Resilient Scheme Based on FMO and Dynamic Redundant Slices Allocation for Wireless Video Transmission","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9347230","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4114801/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Error-Resilient Scheme Based on FMO and Dynamic Redundant Slices Allocation for Wireless Video Transmission","sourcePdf":"53tbc01-katz-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047146S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4114770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4114770","articleId":"4114801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4114804,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hung Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/4114774/4114804/4114804-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Hung Kuo received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1992 and 1994, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, USA, in 2003, all in Electrical Engineering.","He was with Computer and Communications Research Laboratories/Industrial Technology Research Institute (CCL/ITRI), Taiwan, as a DSP Design Engineer from 1996 to 1998.

The short system delay is achieved adopting a demodulation scheme without an additional lowpass filter to remove harmonics, an intelligent slicer of a trellis decoder with a trace back depth of 1 for equalization, and an equi-ripple filter for the 8-VSB pulse shaping filter. To maintain the synchronization, the frequency offset information extracted from the received signal is reflected on a re-transmitting signal. Distinguished features of the EDOCR are adaptive equalization with the intelligent slicer which corrects symbol errors caused by on-air interface including the signal loopback, and the signal processing scheme which demodulates the received signal to a baseband symbol and re-modulates the symbol. Hence, the EDOCR can produce an exact replica of the main transmitter's signal with high SNR although there may be adjacent channels and input signal is distorted by multipath and noise. Finally, the performance evaluation of the designed EDOCR in both simulation and laboratory tests are presented and implementations of single frequency networks employing EDOCRs are discussed. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2006.886453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4114774/04114805.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"37","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2006.886453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Design of Equalization Digital On-Channel Repeater for Single Frequency Network ATSC System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Design of Equalization Digital On-Channel Repeater for Single Frequency Network ATSC System","volume":"53","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9446992","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design of Equalization Digital On-Channel Repeater for Single Frequency Network ATSC System","sourcePdf":"53tbc01-lee-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055112S","chronDate":"March  2007","isNumber":"4114774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4114805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4114809,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Luby","affiliation":["Digital Fountain, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/4114770/4114809/4114809-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Luby cofounded Digital Fountain, Inc. in 1998, where he currently holds the position of Chief Technology Officer.

Raptor codes are known to have characteristics very close to ideal and provide a wide range of operating flexibility and efficiency unmatched by other codes, and in particular they are an excellent implementation of fountain codes. Until now, investigations of the application of Raptor codes to UMTS and EPGRS have used an overall system model that does not accurately model the physical channel and user mobility, simplistically assuming independent random packet losses at the application layer. We investigate MBMS in UMTS in a much more realistic and complete simulation environment by considering advanced and complete channel models that simulate the physical channel and user mobility in a cellular network. We use this realisitic simulation environment to determine optimal system parameters under different mobility models, with different bearer parameters, and without and with selective combining. More specifically, we investigate joint settings of the Raptor code rate, the Turbo code rate, transmission power, etc., to find settings which provide reliable download delivery of files using minimal transmission energy. One of our main results is that optimal system-wide operating points use low transmission power and a modest amount of Turbo coding that results in relatively large radio packet loss rates that is compensated for by using a substantial amount of Raptor coding. These optimal operating points use far less transmission energy for download delivery of files than possible operating points without Raptor","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

To make the variance of the jammed bits same as the other un-jammed bits, a scaling factor is used to adjust the amplitude of the received signal of the jammed bits. This processing benefits the followed Chase decoder. The upper and lower bounds of turbo product codes over such channels are derived and simulations have been performed to evaluate the derived bounds.

It is shown in this paper that CDD can achieve desirable transmit diversity gain over uncorrelated channel with or without receiver diversity. However, in reality, the respective signal paths between spatially separated antennas and the mobile receiver is likely to be correlated because of insufficient antenna separation at the transmitter and the lack of scattering effect of the channel. Under this spatially correlated channel, it is apparent that CDD cannot achieve the same diversity gain as obtained under the uncorrelated channel. In this paper, a new upper bound on the pairwise error probability (PEP) of the CDD with spatial correlation of two transmit antennas is derived. The upper bound is used to study the CDD theoretical error performance and diversity gain losses over a generalized spatially correlated Rayleigh channel. This theoretical analysis is validated by the simulation of DVB-H systems with two transmit antennas and the CDD scheme.

In particular, it has a strong influence on the power gain, energetic efficiency, and reliability of the device. The thermal optimization of device geometry is therefore a key issue, together with precise measurements of temperature within the channel area. In this paper, we have used scanning thermal microscopy to perform temperature mapping, at variable dc bias points, on an AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor made on epilayers grown on silicon carbide substrate. We have analyzed the variation of the thermal resistance values, which are deduced from these measurements, with bias conditions <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$V_{\\rm GS}$</tex></formula> and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$V_{\\rm DS}$</tex></formula>. The observed nonlinear behavior is found to be in excellent agreement with physical simulations, strongly pointing out the large variability of the extension of the dissipation area with the dc bias conditions. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TED.2006.890380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2006.890380","startPage":"385","endPage":"390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4114830/04114831.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SThM Temperature Mapping and Nonlinear Thermal Resistance Evolution With Bias on AlGaN/GaN HEMT Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"SThM Temperature Mapping and Nonlinear Thermal Resistance Evolution With Bias on AlGaN/GaN HEMT Devices","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2007","volume":"54","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4114831/","accessionNumber":"9335764","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114831/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SThM Temperature Mapping and Nonlinear Thermal Resistance Evolution With Bias on AlGaN/GaN HEMT Devices","sourcePdf":"54ted03-aubry.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174738S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4114830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4114830","articleId":"4114831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":4114832,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Brouk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kidron Microelectronics Center, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4114830/4114832/4114832-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Igor Brouk was born in Moscow, Russia, on January 17, 1968.

Two technologies have been newly implemented, namely: 1) the optimized well structure and 2) Cu wiring. The well design has been optimized both for the array device and the peripheral circuit in order to realize full functionality and good retention characteristics.

Given the manufacturing challenges associated with future nanotube-based interconnect solutions, determining the impact of process variations on this new technology relative to standard copper interconnect is vital for predicting the reliability of nanotube-based interconnect. In this paper, we investigate the impact of process variations on future interconnect solutions based on carbon nanotube bundles. Leveraging an equivalent RLC model for SWCNT bundle interconnect, we calculate the relative impact of ten potential sources of variation in SWCNT bundle interconnect on resistance, capacitance, inductance, and delay. We compare the relative impact of variation for SWCNT bundles and standard copper wires as process technology scales and find that SWCNT bundle interconnect will typically have larger overall three-sigma variations in delay. In order to achieve the same percentage variation in both SWCNT bundles and copper interconnect, the percentage variation in bundle dimensions must be reduced by up to 63% in 22-nm process technology","doi":"10.1109/TED.2006.890364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"446","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2006.890364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114830","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4114830/04114852.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","equivalent circuits","integrated circuit interconnections","nanoelectronics","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process variations","VLSI interconnect","single-walled carbon nanotubes","SWCNT","nanotube interconnect","equivalent RLC model","22 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carbon nanotube","interconnect","statistical process variations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Process Variations for Carbon Nanotube Bundles for VLSI Interconnect","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114852/","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4114852/","accessionNumber":"9335772","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of Process Variations for Carbon Nanotube Bundles for VLSI Interconnect","sourcePdf":"54ted03-nieuwoudt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08735S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4114830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4114830","articleId":"4114852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4114862,"authors":[{"name":"Jos Mara Tirado","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic,Control and Communications Engineering, University of Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4114830/4114862/4114862-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Tirado was born in Madrigal de la Vera, C\u00e1ceres, Spain, in 1972.

These events, also referred to as single-event upsets (SEUs), will become more problematic in future technologies. This paper presents a binary content-addressable memory (CAM) design with high immunity to SEUs. Conventionally, error-correcting codes (ECC) have been used in SRAMs to address this issue, but these techniques are not immediately applicable to CAMs because they depend on processing the full contents of the memory word outside the array, which is not possible in a normal CAM access. The proposed design consists of a new matching technique that uses coding to increase the Hamming distance between words, in conjunction with a modified matchline sensing scheme. The result is a CAM design that reduces the SER with no increase in delay or power dissipation, and with only a 12% increase in area","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9454271","htmlLink":"/document/4114964/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Soft-Error Tolerant Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) Using An Error-Correcting-Match Scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Soft-Error Tolerant Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) Using An Error-Correcting-Match Scheme","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"CICC-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049125S","chronDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4114893","isNumber":"4114894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4114893","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4114894","articleId":"4114964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4114969,"authors":[{"name":"Sizhong Chen","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sizhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277600900"},{"name":"Fei Sun","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37069539300"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0076-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0075-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"4114969","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Detectors","Signal design","MIMO","Very large scale integration","Computational complexity","Quadrature amplitude modulation","CMOS technology","Throughput","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-output signal detector","MIMO communication systems","high spectral efficiency","VLSI","nonlinear MIMO signal detectors","64-QAM","CMOS technology","0.13 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114969","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/4114893/4114894/04114969.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2006.320901","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2006.320901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Soft-Output Signal Detector Design and Implementation for MIMO Communication Systems with High Spectral Efficiency","abstract":"VLSI implementations of nonlinear MIMO signal detectors are not trivial, particularly for systems with high spectral efficiency.

But most features can be elucidated only fully by a novel MCU mechanism MCBI (multi-coupled bipolar interaction) proposed by the authors, giving clues for SEU tolerant sub-100nm design","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2006.321010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2006","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/4114893/4114894/04114997.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4114894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2006.321010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4114997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spreading Diversity in Multi-cell Neutron-Induced Upsets with Device Scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4114997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Spreading Diversity in Multi-cell Neutron-Induced Upsets with Device Scaling","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9454282","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","conferenceDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4114997/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spreading Diversity in Multi-cell Neutron-Induced Upsets with Device Scaling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"CICC-00-103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054713S","chronDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4114893","isNumber":"4114894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4114893","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4114894","articleId":"4114997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115000,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Arsovski","affiliation":["IBM Silicon Solutions, Essex Junction, USA"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Arsovski","id":"37297662900"},{"name":"Reid Wistort","affiliation":["IBM Silicon Solutions, Essex Junction, USA"],"firstName":"Reid","lastName":"Wistort","id":"37282772700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0076-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0075-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"4115000","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":613},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","Timing","Uncertainty","Automatic testing","Time measurement","Power measurement","Energy consumption","Hardware","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","content-addressable storage","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-referenced sense amplifier","across-chip-variation immune sensing","content-addressable memories","sense-line precharge","random device variation","self-referenced sensing scheme","CMOS","450 MHz","10 mW","65 nm","0.6 to 1.7 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115000","abstract":"A memory sense-amplifier self-calibrates during sense-line precharge to reduce the required signal development and minimize data capture timing uncertainty caused by random device variation.

The ADC adopts a power efficient amplifier sharing architecture in which a set of switches is introduced to reduce the influence between the two opamp-sharing successive stages. A new configuration is used in the first stage of the ADC to avoid using a dedicated sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) circuit at the input and to avoid the matching requirement between the first multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) and flash input signal paths, which is very strict in a traditional SHA-less architecture. The measured differential and integral nonlinearities of the prototype show less than 0.57 least significant bit (LSB) and 0.8 LSB respectively at full sampling rate. The ADC exhibits higher than 9.1 effective number of bits (ENOB) for input frequencies up to 30 MHz, which is the twofold Nyquist rate (fs/2), at 30 MS/s.

To improve parametric yield of nano-scaled memories, different circuit and architectural level techniques can be used. In this paper, we first analyze and model different SRAM failures due to parameter variations, and discuss test methodologies to test for process variation induced failures. Next, we describe two different self-repairing techniques-at the circuit level, using adaptive body biasing and at the architecture level, using built-in-self-test (BIST), redundancy and address remapping. The discussed self-repair mechanisms can improve design yield much beyond what can be achieved using row/column redundancy and error correcting codes (ECC) alone","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9464639","htmlLink":"/document/4115020/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SRAMs in Scaled Technologies under Process Variations: Failure Mechanisms, Test & Variation Tolerant Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAMs in Scaled Technologies under Process Variations: Failure Mechanisms, Test & Variation Tolerant Design","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"CICC-00-126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055146S","chronDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4114893","isNumber":"4114894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4114893","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4114894","articleId":"4115020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115030,"authors":[{"name":"Che-fu Liang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-fu","lastName":"Liang","id":"37289742200"},{"name":"Sy-chyuan Hwu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sy-chyuan","lastName":"Hwu","id":"37297671400"},{"name":"Shen-iuan Liu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shen-iuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280143000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0076-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0075-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"4115030","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1061},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Clocks","CMOS technology","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Phase locked loops","Jitter","Passive optical networks","Filters","Phase detection","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","CMOS digital integrated circuits","phase detectors","synchronisation","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst-mode CDR circuit","clock and data recovery circuit","CMOS technology","gated voltage-controlled oscillator","quadrature generator","phase-aligning loop","half-rate bang-bang phase detector","digital phase interpolator","10 Gbit/s","200 mW","0.18 micron","10.44 ps","1.8 V","32 bit"]}],"abstract":"A 10Gbps burst-mode clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit has been fabricated in 0.18mum CMOS technology.

The proposed circuit uses a charge transfer readout similar to CCD; thus, the summing of the signal charges can be implemented easily compared with other typical CMOS readout circuits for TDI arrays. The weakness of TDI arrays related to defective pixels can be solved by integrating a dead pixel elimination circuit. In addition, the proposed method can be applied to a TDI arrays with large depths, so a high signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be acquired. The readout chip has been fabricated using a 0.6 mum standard CMOS process for 150times64 CdTe X-ray detector arrays.

A tail-free CMOS amplifier having a large oscillating amplitude was used to minimize the VCO phase noise. The tank inductor has an octagonal patterned metal cage to shield it from the noise radiated by the digital side of the IC. A high resolution capacitor-DAC was used to bring the oscillating frequency within 0.1% of the target value, resulting in a sub-150MHz/V VCO gain. A virtually constant tuning-gain was achieved with a variable capacitance implemented with constant metal finger capacitors and FET voltage controlled resistors. This varactor-less LC-VCO can be implemented in any standard digital CMOS technology that has thick top metal layers. The supply pushing was reduced by balancing the positive voltage coefficient gate capacitances with the negative voltage coefficient drain diffusion capacitances. The power consumption was reduced to about half with a tuned load clock buffer.

This presents a serious challenge to systems that might attempt to use a high-rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to sample these signals, as prescribed by the Shannon/Nyquist sampling theorem. In these situations, however, the information level of the signal is often far lower than the actual bandwidth, which prompts the question of whether more efficient schemes can be developed for measuring such signals. In this paper we propose a system that uses modulation, filtering, and sampling to produce a low-rate set of digital measurements. Our \"analog-to-information converter\" (AIC) is inspired by the theory of compressive sensing (CS), which states that a discrete signal having a sparse representation in some dictionary can be recovered from a small number of linear projections of that signal. We generalize the CS theory to continuous-time sparse signals, explain our proposed AIC system in the CS context, and discuss practical issues regarding implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115115/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9308666","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4115115/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analog-to-Information Conversion via Random Demodulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog-to-Information Conversion via Random Demodulation","confLoc":"Richardson, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"DCAS-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055626S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115092","isNumber":"4115093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115092","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"4115093","articleId":"4115115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4115116,"authors":[{"name":"Chitranjan K.

However, the optimal scheduling requires that the full channel state information (CSI) for all users be available to the transmitter. In this work it is shown that the same rate growth holds even if the feedback rate from the users to the transmitter is reduced to 1-bit per fading block. A simple analysis for this setup is presented, resulting in a closed form expression for the achievable ergodic sum-rate. The mechanism of setting a sub-optimal threshold is elucidated by simple lower and upper bounds to the sum-rate.

However, it may not be effective for TCP flows since (a) there is no strict QoS requirement in TCP traffic; and (b) it is difficult to estimate the amount of required bandwidth due to dynamic changes of the sending rate. In this letter, we propose a new uplink scheduling scheme for best-effort TCP traffic in IEEE 802.16 networks. The proposed scheme does not need any bandwidth request process for allocation. Instead, it estimates the amount of bandwidth required for a flow based on its current sending rate. Through simulation, we show that the proposed scheme is effective to allocate bandwidth for TCP flows.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2007.061509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4115136/04115144.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"148","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2007.061509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TCP-Aware Uplink Scheduling for IEEE 802.16","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"TCP-Aware Uplink Scheduling for IEEE 802.16","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4115144/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9411333","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TCP-Aware Uplink Scheduling for IEEE 802.16","sourcePdf":"cl_0702_146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037403S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4115136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4115136","articleId":"4115144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4115147,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-woo So","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-woo","lastName":"So","id":"37293500300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4115147","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Performance analysis","Internet telephony","Media Access Protocol","Frequency conversion","Analytical models","Modulation coding","Traffic control","Queueing analysis","Speech analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency division multiple access","IEEE standards","Internet telephony","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice-over-Internet protocol","VoIP service","wireless mobile network","IEEE 802.16e","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA system","downlink performance analysis"]}],"abstract":"The voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service is expected to be widely supported in wireless mobile networks, though its feasibility and capacity have not been studied in relation to the emerging IEEE 802.16e orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system.

Multi-carrier transmission over frequency-selective fading is employed. In particular, this work is concerned with the question of obtaining an adaptation technique that will keep the transmitted power as constant as possible over all subcarriers, i.e. quasi-constant transmission power, assuming a general, un-constrained set of coded-modulation schemes. A computationally efficient algorithm is described for solving this so-called minimum-deviation problem. The proposed solution is shown to be optimum under a given set of constraints. It is also demonstrated, via simulations, to provide throughput comparable to other known methods whose aim is to optimize system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2006.321076","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115231/4115232/04115239.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2006.321076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit loading for OFDM with Quasi-constant transmission power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115239/","displayDocTitle":"Bit loading for OFDM with Quasi-constant transmission power","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115239/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit loading for OFDM with Quasi-constant transmission power","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"EEEI-00-7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031572S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115231","isNumber":"4115232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115231","xplore-issue":"4115232","articleId":"4115239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115247,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

OFDM is a linear modulation, therefore large PAPR requires large linear dynamic range of the transmitter (TX) as well as the receiver (RX) paths. The weak point in the TX-RX chain is the Power Amplifier (PA). As known, a linear PA which is able to amplify signals with large PAPR has to have a large dynamic range that results with low power efficiency, thus by reducing PAPR one may improve the efficiency of PA. A PAPR reducing method in OFDM, based on SeLective Mapping (SLM) is considered. As known, SLM requires transmitting a Side Information (SI). Increasing the SLM order reduces the PAPR but increases the size of SI. In order to transmit the SI some power and bandwidth are needed, those are taken from the total power and bandwidth budget and thus lowering the capacity. On the other hand the reduced PAPR improves the PA efficiency, thus increases the channel capacity. Accordingly maximal value of channel capacity is expected as well as an optimal SLM order.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2006.321129","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115231/4115232/04115263.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2006.321129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115232","startPage":"138","endPage":"140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On channel capacity of OFDM with SLM method for PAPR reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On channel capacity of OFDM with SLM method for PAPR reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115263/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4115263/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On channel capacity of OFDM with SLM method for PAPR reduction","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"EEEI-00-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047855S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115231","isNumber":"4115232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115231","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4115232","articleId":"4115263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115265,"authors":[{"name":"Ishai Ilani","affiliation":["Company Scientist of Actelis Networks, Israel"],"firstName":"Ishai","lastName":"Ilani","id":"37283949700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0229-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0230-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4115265","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point to Multipoint Channel Estimation by \"Abuse\" of Receivers","abstract":"With increasing bandwidths and decreasing loop lengths, crosstalk becomes the main impairment in VDSL systems. For downstream communication, crosstalk precompensation techniques have been designed to cope with this issue by using the collocation of the transmitters. These techniques naturally need an accurate estimation of the crosstalk channel responses. This paper investigates the issue of estimating and tracking these channels. It was previously thought that efficient estimation schemes must use some part of the upstream or downstream bit rates. Moreover, it was assumed that the training signals and their duration must be coordinated between the collocated transmitters and the receivers. In this paper, a new algorithm is presented that practically needs no real-time coordination between the transmitters and the receivers and only needs a very narrow-band control channel between the transmitters and the receivers. The principle is to define two different types of precoding matrices, namely estimation precoding matrices (EPM) for estimation and tracking and cancellation precoding matrices (CPM) for the actual FEXT precompensation. During the estimation period the information symbols are modulated by the estimation precoding matrices, which cause the transmitted symbols to be slightly distorted. These distorted signals \"abuse\" the adaptive filters at the receivers, and cause the filters to converge to parameters that are functions of the crosstalk channel responses. The proposed estimation algorithm allows upgrading of SISO VDSL systems into FEXT cancelled systems by upgrading the transmitters alone without replacing the existing receivers.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115231/4115232/04115265.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2006.321131","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2006.321131","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115265","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitters","Crosstalk","Feedback","Bandwidth","Adaptive filters","Frequency estimation","Attenuation","Degradation","Additive noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cancellation precoding matrices","estimation precoding matrices","FEXT","MIMO","VDSL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115265/","displayDocTitle":"Point to Multipoint Channel Estimation by \"Abuse\" of Receivers","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4115265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Point to Multipoint Channel Estimation by \"Abuse\" of Receivers","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"EEEI-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069937S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115231","isNumber":"4115232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115231","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4115232","articleId":"4115265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4115271,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The demand for reducing cost per gigabytes is one of the main reasons for using electronic equalizers which are very cost-effective. The common and useful optimization criterion to estimate the DFE coefficients is the minimum mean square error (MMSE). However, the MMSE solution does not achieve optimal performances, and the minimum BER (MBER) is the ultimate performances criterion. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the probability of error with DFE and examine the optimal optimization criterion, MBER for DFE in optical communication system. A BER performance comparison analysis shows that the MBER optimization criterion introduces improvements over the conventional minimum MSE optimization criterion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115231/4115232/04115271.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2006.321137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2006.321137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum BER criteria for DFE in Optical Communication System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Optical fiber communication","Decision feedback equalizers","Intersymbol interference","Optical noise","Optical receivers","Chromatic dispersion","Mean square error methods","Stimulated emission","Optical filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFE","MBER","MMSE","optical communication system","EDC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Minimum BER criteria for DFE in Optical Communication System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115271/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum BER criteria for DFE in Optical Communication System","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"EEEI-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046214S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115231","isNumber":"4115232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115231","xplore-issue":"4115232","articleId":"4115271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115286,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantin Moiseev","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Konstantin","lastName":"Moiseev","id":"37294217500"},{"name":"Shmuel Wimer","affiliation":["Mobile Platform Group, Intel Israel (74) Limited, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shmuel","lastName":"Wimer","id":"37294219200"},{"name":"Avinoam Kolodny","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Avinoam","lastName":"Kolodny","id":"37298838100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0229-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0230-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4115286","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Noise reduction","Very large scale integration","Crosstalk","Integrated circuit interconnections","Circuit noise","CMOS technology","Uncertainty","Wires","Coupling circuits"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective technique for simultaneous interconnect channel delay and noise reduction in nanometer VLSI design","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2006.321062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115232","endPage":"240","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115231/4115232/04115286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2006.321062","startPage":"236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115286","abstract":"Capacitive coupling is the primary source of noise in nanometer technology digital CMOS VLSI circuits.

Delay uncertainty optimization can be seen as a subset of interconnect delay optimization. This paper addresses the problem of ordering and sizing parallel wires in a single metal layer within an interconnect channel of a given width, such that cross-capacitances are optimally shared for simultaneous noise and delay minimization. Using an Elmore delay model including cross capacitances for a bundle of wires and well-known crosstalk models, we show that \"symmetric hill\" wire ordering according to the strength of signal drivers, which is known to optimize channel timing characteristics, can be used also for minimizing channel noise metrics.

This extends similar previous results proved over the erasure channel and over the AWGN channel, indicating the step function property of the EXIT chart is rather general. It follows that, for a common class of iterative receivers where the error correcting decoder must operate at the first iterations at rate above capacity (such as in turbo equalization, turbo channel estimation, parallel and serial concatenated coding and the like), classical good codes which achieve capacity over the relevant channels are not effective and should be replaced by different new ones.

However, the extracted features may be unreliable for anomaly detection in textures due to inconsistencies between the assumed background model and the true data. In this paper, we present an anomaly detection scheme which relies on a statistical model of textures and is specifically designed for detection of anomalies in textures. Motivated by recent works on texture segmentation and texture classification, we introduce a multi-resolution feature space that facilitates anomaly detection with constant false alarm rate for a wide range of textures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, when applied to images containing background texture, achieves improved detection results and lower false alarm rate than a competitive anomaly detection scheme.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2006.321102","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115231/4115232/04115310.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2006.321102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Anomalies in Textures Based on Multi-Resolution Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115310/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Anomalies in Textures Based on Multi-Resolution Features","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115310/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Anomalies in Textures Based on Multi-Resolution Features","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"EEEI-00-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049367S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115231","isNumber":"4115232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115231","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4115232","articleId":"4115310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4115315,"authors":[{"name":"Alba Sloin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Alba","lastName":"Sloin","id":"37294267400"},{"name":"David Burshtein","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Burshtein","id":"37272732600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0229-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0230-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4115315","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Hidden Markov models","Iterative algorithms","Kernel","Support vector machine classification","Error analysis","Speech analysis","Speech recognition","Maximum likelihood estimation","Pattern recognition"]}],"abstract":"We present a method that uses a set of maximum-likelihood (ML) trained discrete HMM models as a baseline system, and an SVM training scheme to re-score the results of the baseline HMMs. It turns out that the re-scoring model can be represented as an un-normalized HMM.

Simulation results validate that the BER improvement achieved by using the BER-allocation algorithm in the MIMO-OFDM case is significant.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2006.321120","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","startPage":"403","endPage":"407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2006.321120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115232","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115231/4115232/04115321.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 24th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Throughput","Channel state information","Fading","Power system modeling","OFDM","Collision mitigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive loading for MIMO and MIMO-OFDM channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115321/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115321/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive loading for MIMO and MIMO-OFDM channels","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"EEEI-00-89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073981S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115231","isNumber":"4115232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115231","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4115232","articleId":"4115321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115340,"authors":[{"name":"Santanu Chaudhuri","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Santanu","lastName":"Chaudhuri","id":"37289489200"},{"name":"Warren Anderson","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Warren","lastName":"Anderson","id":"37290721000"},{"name":"John Bryan","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Bryan","id":"37300581300"},{"name":"James McCall","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"McCall","id":"37287599700"},{"name":"Sanjay Dabral","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Dabral","id":"37294307200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4107"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4115"}],"articleNumber":"4115340","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":863},"abstract":"Jitter amplification characteristics of different forwarded clock channels at 6.4 and 9.6 Gb/s are illustrated with model correlations.

There have been many macromodeling techniques proposed in the past to model both the active and passive components of an electrical interface. These macromodels help in reducing the simulation time and CPU memory consumption while maintaining the accuracy. A full blown design space exploration is needed to find the worst case corner(s) of an electrical interface. The number of simulations needed for this would be in the order of thousands. Performing these simulations, even with scalable I/O macromodels, is cumbersome and parsing the output data from these simulations is equally tedious. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is described to find the worst case corner(s) in highspeed server electrical analysis. It has been shown that by using GA based approach the worst case corner(s) can be estimated without performing a full-blown Monte Carlo sweep. Scalable I/O macromodels are used along with GA based approach to enhance the efficiency of the proposed technique","doi":"10.1109/EPEP.2006.321194","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Electrical Performane of Electronic Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115326/4115327/04115354.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Electrical Performane of Electronic Packaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEP.2006.321194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms with Scalable I/O Macromodels to Find the Worst Case Corner in High-Speed Server Electrical Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Performance analysis","Driver circuits","Central Processing Unit","Monte Carlo methods","Circuit simulation","Voltage","Space exploration","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","genetic algorithms","queueing theory","time-domain synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","scalable I/O macromodels","worst case corner","high speed server electrical analysis","time domain electrical analysis","high seed high end server systems","simulation time","CPU memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithms with Scalable I/O Macromodels to Find the Worst Case Corner in High-Speed Server Electrical Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115354/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9253332","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithms with Scalable I/O Macromodels to Find the Worst Case Corner in High-Speed Server Electrical Analysis","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"EPEP-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054399S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115326","isNumber":"4115327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115326","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4115327","articleId":"4115354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115364,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Song","affiliation":["Advanced Research and Development, Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Song","id":"37289223100"},{"name":"Feng Ling","affiliation":["Advanced Research and Development, Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Ling","id":"38557084900"},{"name":"Warren Harris","affiliation":["Advanced Research and Development, Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Warren","lastName":"Harris","id":"38558901200"},{"name":"Aykut Dengi","affiliation":["Advanced Research and Development, Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Aykut","lastName":"Dengi","id":"38556542500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4107"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4115"}],"articleNumber":"4115364","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115364","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Circuit simulation","Least squares approximation","Computational modeling","Scattering parameters","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Frequency domain analysis","Vectors","Robustness","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","computational electromagnetics","multiport networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband rational model","adaptive frequency sampling","full-wave simulation","vector fitting"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a stable broadband rational modeling approach through adaptive frequency sampling for full-wave simulation.

The entire procedure is numerically rigorous without making any theoretical approximation. The computational complexity only involves solving a single layer irrespective of the original problem size.

The main focus of this paper is to propose MANAGE1 as a design of a new stream cipher system to be used for data encryption in CDMA wireless networks. This new cipher system is intended to replace the offered data encryption algorithm in CDMA networks known as ORYX. The proposed cipher system is being assessed from different aspects. The first aspect addresses the period and linear complexity profiles of the generated keystream.

The aim of the paper is to test the efficiency of implementing an independent component analysis (ICA) based estimator of the transmitted symbols preceded by principal component analysis (PCA) pre-processing of the received data to reduce dimension and decrease the noise effects. The noisy ICA algorithm is used either as: (1) a pre-processor prior to conventional detection: The idea here is to estimate the mixing matrix that contains the basic vectors and fading terms using the separating matrix and PCA subspace or as (2) a post-processor attached to a linear DS-CDMA receiver. Numerical simulations indicate that the first schema could constitute a powerful tool for channel and symbols estimations and has the advantage that it doesn't necessitate any prior knowledge of the users' codes or paths delays and strengths except providing a short pilot sequence (presenting 1% to 4% of the transmitted symbols of the user of interest) that is used to give a good enough initial guess of the demising matrix columns and so force the ICA iteration to be in the wanted user subspace. The second schema shows performance comparable to or superior than the exact blind detectors at relatively high SNR values","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084035/4115468/04115514.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2006.320454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2006.320454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Enhancement of Downlink Multiuser DS-CDMA Detectors Using Processing by Independent Component Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Independent component analysis","Additive white noise","Principal component analysis","AWGN","Gaussian noise","Delay estimation","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","code division multiple access","independent component analysis","interference suppression","matrix algebra","multiuser detection","principal component analysis","radio receivers","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink multiuser DS-CDMA detectors","independent component analysis","received digital signal generation","linear signal detection","synchronous multiuser direct sequence code division multiple access","spreading codes","additive white Gaussian noise","signal-to-noise ratios","user power distributions","principal component analysis","noise reduction","mixing matrix estimation","separating matrix","linear DS-CDMA receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation","independent component analysis","multiuser detection","principal component analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance Enhancement of Downlink Multiuser DS-CDMA Detectors Using Processing by Independent Component Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9232336","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"5-7 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Enhancement of Downlink Multiuser DS-CDMA Detectors Using Processing by Independent Component Analysis","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"ICCES-00-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044323S","chronDate":"5-7 Nov. 2006","isNumber":"4115468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084035","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4115514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4115524,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The selection of optimized encoding method for network composition is necessary to accommodate a maximum number of subscribers that have simultaneous access over the local area network and the bandwidth of subscriber services available on it. When composing this encoder/decoder optically, passive elements are exclusively used, if possible, so as to make the composition method simple and economical. In this paper we present an analysis of OCDMA passive communication networks focusing on the modeling of optical encoder/decoder blocks for different types of delay elements. The main objective of the paper is to study the performance of these networks including the effect of the passive encoder/decoder parameters such as splitter and optical delay line losses. Different types of delay lines are proposed including optical fibers and fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) as delay elements for the selection of the optical delay line which achieves a better performance.

Despite some scattered results, a principled approach towards \"when and where to take a step\" has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present methods for computing capture points and the capture region, the region on the ground where a humanoid must step to in order to come to a complete stop. The intersection between the capture region and the base of support determines which strategy the robot should adopt to successfully stop in a given situation. Computing the capture region for a humanoid, in general, is very difficult. However, with simple models of walking, computation of the capture region is simplified. We extend the well-known linear inverted pendulum model to include a flywheel body and show how to compute exact solutions of the capture region for this model. Adding rotational inertia enables the humanoid to control its centroidal angular momentum, much like the way human beings do, significantly enlarging the capture region. We present simulations of a simple planar biped that can recover balance after a push by stepping to the capture region and using internal angular momentum. Ongoing work involves applying the solution from the simple model as an approximate solution to more complex simulations of bipedal walking, including a 3D biped with distributed mass.","doi":"10.1109/ICHR.2006.321385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHR.2006.321385","startPage":"200","endPage":"207","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115555/4115556/04115602.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 6th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capture Point: A Step toward Humanoid Push Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Capture Point: A Step toward Humanoid Push Recovery","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115602/","accessionNumber":"9528364","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115602/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capture Point: A Step toward Humanoid Push Recovery","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"ICHR-00-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069134S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115555","isNumber":"4115556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115555","citationCount":"613","xplore-issue":"4115556","articleId":"4115602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":4115614,"authors":[{"name":"Ch.

The tuning circuit of the power pick-up is based on the LCL configuration and provides a simple relationship between the open circuit voltage of the pick-up coil and the output voltage regardless of the load variation. The use of magnetic amplifier as a variable inductor offers significant advantages where the inductance is dynamically varied using a controller and BJT to deliver power under a variety of load conditions. The proposed method can significantly improve the overall performance of the ICPT (inductively coupled power transfer) system by producing continuous waveforms within the system at all times.

So according to the application characteristics of fault analysis of power system, this paper uses lossless compression for the useful frequency band signal and lossy compression for the unimportant frequency band signal. A data compression method is proposed for fault transient signal according to the special requirements of power system. Firstly, put up the simulation circuit, gather the fault data and then dispersed wavelet transform is employed to decompose the fault signal into information of various frequency bands. Then different quantization and codes are used to frequency bands respectively, such as the method of Huffman code is employed to compress low frequency band, threshold quantification is used for high frequency bands. The simulation in MATLAB6.5 shows that the method proposed has a good compression rate and wide potential in application.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2006.321803","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115872/4115873/04115973.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2006.321803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power System Fault Data Compression Using the Wavelet Transform and Vector Quantification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4115973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4115973/","displayDocTitle":"Power System Fault Data Compression Using the Wavelet Transform and Vector Quantification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10312513","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4115973/","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Fault Data Compression Using the Wavelet Transform and Vector Quantification","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"IMPACT-00-100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039964S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115872","isNumber":"4115873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115872","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4115873","articleId":"4115973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4116011,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

A novel design employing PWM switching, for shaping the trip curve, has been simulated and a prototype suggested. Matlab/Simulink simulations based on practical traction substation parameters show expected voltages and currents at various points in the circuit. A simplified traction schematic diagram shows the basis of the simulations and an area of typical application. A block schematic diagram highlights the basic electrical design.

It has potential benefits in curbing emissions and reducing the consumption of irreplaceable fuel reserves. However, the penetration of wind power into traditional fuel- based generation systems will also cause some implications such as security concerns due to its unpredictable nature. Thus, in economic power dispatch with power penetration, a reasonable tradeoff between system risk and operational cost is desired. In this paper, a bi-objective economic dispatch problem considering wind penetration is formulated, which treats economic and security impacts as conflicting objectives. A modified multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is adopted to develop a power dispatch scheme which is able to achieve the compromise between economic and security requirements. The numerical simulations including sensitivity analysis are carried out based on a typical IEEE test power system to show the validity and applicability of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2006.321416","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115872/4115873/04116026.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2006.321416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tradeoff Between Risk and Cost in Economic Dispatch Including Wind Power Penetration Using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Tradeoff Between Risk and Cost in Economic Dispatch Including Wind Power Penetration Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","accessionNumber":"10312566","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4116026/","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoff Between Risk and Cost in Economic Dispatch Including Wind Power Penetration Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"IMPACT-00-153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055209S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115872","isNumber":"4115873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115872","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4115873","articleId":"4116026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4116028,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoyin Wen","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyin","lastName":"Wen","id":"37285285600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0110-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0111-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4116028","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":743},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy storage","Batteries","Power systems","Ceramics","Temperature","Power system stability","Displays","Costs","Safety","Particle separators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supplies to apparatus","secondary cells","sodium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage technology","Sodium Sulfur Battery","temperature stability","energy density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sodium sulfur battery","beta-alumina","energy storage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116028","abstract":"Sodium sulfur battery is one of the most promising candidates for energy storage application.

Therefore in theory the zero-sequence active current passing through the fault line is greater than others in absolute value. Energy function is the integrating of product of zero-sequence voltage with zero-sequence current. The fault line's energy function value is negative, while the non-fault's is positive. If three-phase earth capacitance is imbalanced, zero-sequence voltage produces, which will produce zero-sequence current passing through all the line.

This paper analyzes the influences in different compensation conditions in theory.

It acts by making full use of the advantageous interactions among controllers while minimizing adverse interactions such that power system oscillations are suppressed effectively.

In the scheme, B-spline membership fuzzy neural network is employed to predict future harmonic compensating current. In order to make the predictive model compact and accurate, a genetic algorithm with an efficient search strategy is developed to optimize the weighting factors, the knot positions and the control points of the B-spline membership fuzzy neural networks. Based on the model output, branch-and-bound optimization method is adopted to produce proper value of control vector. This control vector is adequately modulated by means of a space vector PWM modulator which generates proper gating patterns of the inverter switches to maintain tracking of reference current. Fuzzy neural network based predictive algorithm is used in internal model control scheme to compensate for process disturbances, measurement noise and modeling errors. Experiment on an actual system is implemented.

Voltage source converter (VSC) based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) has the advantages of flexible operation and control and the disadvantages of high cost. Combining the advantages of the two kinds of transmissions, a novel hybrid HVDC transmission type is analyzed in this paper, which the sending terminal adopts phase control converter (PCC) and the receiving terminal adopts VSC. The hybrid HVDC system can supply to passive network, supply reactive power to AC system and expediently extend to two bi-terminal or multi-terminal systems from conventional HVDC system. The expressions of voltage, current and power in rectifier and inverter sides are deduced. The relationship between the operational variables and control variables is analyzed. The basic regulation characteristics are gotten. The simulation model is founded based on the simulation software PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that the hybrid HVDC system could be operated steadily when the system active power changes slowly and quickly. It has the application prospect in scope of long distance small load supplying, multi-terminal DC system connection and system black-start etc.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2006.321914","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115872/4115873/04116235.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2006.321914","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operational Mechanism and Characteristic Analysis of Novel Hybrid HVDC system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Operational Mechanism and Characteristic Analysis of Novel Hybrid HVDC system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116235/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4116235/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10312773","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operational Mechanism and Characteristic Analysis of Novel Hybrid HVDC system","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"IMPACT-00-362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049009S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115872","isNumber":"4115873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115872","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4115873","articleId":"4116235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4116242,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed N.

Therefore, accurate Excitation models are of great importance in the simulation and the investigation of the power system transient phenomena. In this paper, a nonlinear identification method for the excitation system (EXS) of Mianhuatan power plant in China is presented. Two different identification methods, i.e., genetic algorithm and prediction error method (PEM) are used and compared. In the genetic algorithm, a block-diagram for the EXS is suggested at first. In the investigated excitation system, measurement was performed at no-load operation condition to obtain step response used for the identification of the parameters for the model. The simulation results and the comparison show the good accuracy of both methods. Although the model based on parameter obtained by the genetic algorithm shows a better fit when its output response is compared with that obtained with the prediction error method.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2006.321951","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115872/4115873/04116242.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2006.321951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Parameter Identification of Excitation System based on a Genetic Algorithm Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Genetic algorithms","Power system modeling","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Power system dynamics","Power system simulation","Power system transients","Power generation","Performance evaluation","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","hydroelectric power stations","power system parameter estimation","power system transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model parameter identification","excitation system","genetic algorithm technique","power system transient phenomena","nonlinear identification","Mianhuatan hydro power plant","prediction error method","no-load operation condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["excitation system","parameter estimation","genetic algorithm method","prediction error method (PEM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Model Parameter Identification of Excitation System based on a Genetic Algorithm Techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4116242/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10312780","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Parameter Identification of Excitation System based on a Genetic Algorithm Techniques","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"IMPACT-00-369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095487S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115872","isNumber":"4115873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115872","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4115873","articleId":"4116242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4116250,"authors":[{"name":"H.y.

This paper proposes an alternative technique to effectively characterize voltage variations of all durations. It uses wavelet analysis to zoom into a high frequency band for the time information, and the fundamental frequency band for the magnitude change. It is shown to be effective even for very short interruption, which is difficult to determine using the RMS method. Compared to other wavelet methods, its low computational requirement makes it suitable for real-time application.

A dual fitness scheme that takes both objective and constraint into account is adopted to evaluate the survival chance of any particle, thus avoid the drawbacks of traditional penalty method. In the evolution process, if the population best particle has no update during a prescribed number of consecutive generations, it is regarded as a local optimum solution and the searching space around this particle is locked to prevent other particles flying into it. And this particle is saved as one of the candidate solution. In the end, by comparing the fitness of all saved particles and the current population best particle, the optimum value can be obtained. This improved particle swarm algorithm is then successfully applied to IEEE118 bus system optimization problem.

A novel approach is proposed in this paper for fast prediction of loadability margins with respect to small-signal stability based on neural networks. Small-signal stability boundaries are constructed by means of loading the power system until the stability limits are reached from a base operating point along various loading directions. Back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) for different contingencies are trained to approximate these stability boundaries. A search algorithm is then proposed to predict the loadability margins from any stable operating point along arbitrary loading directions through an iterative technique based on the trained BPNNs. The simulation results for the IEEE two-area benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for on-line prediction of loadability margins.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116344/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10312882","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4116344/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast Prediction of Loadability Margins by Constructing a Small-Signal Stability Boundary Based on Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Prediction of Loadability Margins by Constructing a Small-Signal Stability Boundary Based on Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"IMPACT-00-471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059376S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115872","isNumber":"4115873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115872","xplore-issue":"4115873","articleId":"4116344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4116345,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Power system stabilizer (PSS) and flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices are used to enhance system stability. In large systems multi-machine, using only conventional PSS may not provide sufficient damping for inter- area oscillations. In these cases, FACTS power oscillation damping controllers are effective solutions. But uncoordinated local control of FACTS devices and PSS's may cause destabilizing interactions. In this paper, using objective function which maximizes the function, the total damping ratios of the system are optimized and dynamic stability of the system will be improved. In this method all the operation conditions are considered. Simulation results for a large system and different operation conditions of the system shows that this method has a good efficiency and can be effective solution for this problem in a large system. This method can be effective for the coordinating of multi-controllers in large power systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2006.321541","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115872/4115873/04116345.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2006.321541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordination of PSS and FACTS Damping Controllers in Large Power Systems for Dynamic Stability Improvement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Coordination of PSS and FACTS Damping Controllers in Large Power Systems for Dynamic Stability Improvement","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4116345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10312883","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordination of PSS and FACTS Damping Controllers in Large Power Systems for Dynamic Stability Improvement","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"IMPACT-00-472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042386S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115872","isNumber":"4115873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115872","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4115873","articleId":"4116345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4116349,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Ma","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Ma","id":"37293357300"},{"name":"Zhao Yang Dong","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhao Yang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37275835400"},{"name":"Pei Zhang","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289129500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0110-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0111-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4116349","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1488},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116349","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system dynamics","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Sensitivity analysis","Power system analysis computing","Power system stability","Control systems","Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Power system control","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","power system control","power system planning","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalue sensitivity analysis","dynamic power system","power system controller design","system operating parameters","augmented system matrix","IEEE 5-machine 14-bus system","power system planning","power system control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eigenvalue sensitivity","power system","system state matrix","small signal stability"]}],"abstract":"Eigenvalue sensitivity analysis has been an effective tool for power system controller design.

The underlying idea is to train an artificial neural network ANN to learn the behaviour of an external power system. After training, the ANN can be attached to the study system at its boundary buses, replacing the external power system and reproducing its behaviour. The equivalent model proposed in the article expresses the relationship between the power flows in the interconnection lines and the phase and voltage of the boundary buses. Thus, no external system information is required for constructing the equivalent. The model is functional in both directions, i.e using power flows as inputs and phasor voltages as outputs or using phasor voltages as inputs and power flows as outputs. The method was implemented and evaluated on the IEEE-30 bus system and on the Chinese Jiangxi province power system containing 294 buses. The results show that, given appropriate training, the ANN can serve as a model for a power system in an accurate and robust manner. Contrary to the classical methods, the non-linear character of the ANN enables it to accurately model the functioning of the external system also after major operating condition changes such as branch and generator outages.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2006.321647","pdfPath":"/iel5/4115872/4115873/04116384.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2006.321647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4115873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Neural Networks to the Identification of Steady State Equivalents of External Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Application of Neural Networks to the Identification of Steady State Equivalents of External Power Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","accessionNumber":"10312922","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4116384/","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Neural Networks to the Identification of Steady State Equivalents of External Power Systems","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"IMPACT-00-511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072422S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4115872","isNumber":"4115873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4115872","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4115873","articleId":"4116384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4116387,"authors":[{"name":"Li Feng","affiliation":["Chongqing Electric Power Corporation, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Feng","id":"37290912600"},{"name":"Jianjun He","affiliation":["Chongqing Electric Power Corporation, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"He","id":"37291509700"},{"name":"Qingyun Kong","affiliation":["Chongqing Electric Power Corporation, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qingyun","lastName":"Kong","id":"37298880300"},{"name":"Lin Guo","affiliation":["Chongqing Electric Power Corporation, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37288442700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0110-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0111-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4116387","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Load forecasting","Shape","Artificial neural networks","Industrial power systems","Helium","High performance computing","Mining industry","Association rules","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","fuzzy set theory","load forecasting","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-objective algorithm","particle swarm optimization","electrical short-term load forecasting","fuzzy rule-based classifier","electrical load pattern classification","Pareto optimum rules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Association rule mining","Fuzzy rule-based classifier","Multi-objective optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Load forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116387","abstract":"Based on the knowledge of historical data sets, a fuzzy rule-based classifier for electrical load pattern classification is set up.

Recently, the 60 GHz band has received much attention due to its 5 GHz of available spectrum. However, the propagation of signals in this band is strongly hindered by attenuation and line-of-sight requirements. The situation gets worse in the in-building environment where signal propagation is obstructed by physical objects such as walls, furniture etc. In this paper, we present a novel radio over fiber (RoF) architecture that is cost-effective and is able to deliver high data-rate of the order of gigabits. To ensure a seamless communication environment at the 60 GHz band, we propose the concept of extended cells (EC) in order to create sufficient overlap areas. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture by simulating an in-building network at the 60 GHz band employing the RoF and EC concepts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4116563/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9420279","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Toward a Seamless Communication Architecture for In-building Networks at the 60 GHz band","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Seamless Communication Architecture for In-building Networks at the 60 GHz band","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"LCN-00-73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054811S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4116489","isNumber":"4116490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4116489","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4116490","articleId":"4116563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4116569,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Duy Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Technology, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Anh Duy","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38186305500"},{"name":"Deniz Gurkan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Technology, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"Gurkan","id":"37291717900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0418-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0419-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4116569","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"abstract":"This paper presents the performance analysis of a code translation (conversion) module for an optical code-division multiple access (O-CDMA) local area network (LAN) system.

The system architecture and design are first detailed, followed by a description of the current working implementation, which is based on our DSYS25z sensing nodes. Results of a series of real experimental tests regarding connectivity, sensing and network performance are then discussed. The analysis of link characteristics in the car-park scenario shows unexpected reliability patterns which have a strong influence on MAC and routing protocol design. Two unexpected link reliability patterns are identified and documented. First, the presence of the objects (cars) being sensed can cause significant interference and degradation in communication performance. Second, link quality has a high temporal correlation but a low spatial correlation. From these observations we conclude that a) the construction and maintenance of a fixed topology is not useful and b) spatial rather than temporal message replicates can improve transport reliability","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2006.322020","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2006 31st IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4116489/4116490/04116625.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4116490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2006.322020","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2006 31st IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","startPage":"588","endPage":"595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Car-Park Management using Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Car-Park Management using Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116625/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4116625/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9420334","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Car-Park Management using Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"LCN-00-135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15736S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4116489","isNumber":"4116490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4116489","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4116490","articleId":"4116625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":4116633,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Osterlind","affiliation":["Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Osterlind","id":"37298511200"},{"name":"Adam Dunkels","affiliation":["Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Dunkels","id":"37279690100"},{"name":"Joakim Eriksson","affiliation":["Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Eriksson","id":"37273830700"},{"name":"Niclas Finne","affiliation":["Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Finne","id":"37298512700"},{"name":"Thiemo Voigt","affiliation":["Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden"],"firstName":"Thiemo","lastName":"Voigt","id":"37279685900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0418-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0419-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4116633","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":461,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2342},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116633","abstract":"Simulators for wireless sensor networks are a valuable tool for system development. However, current simulators can only simulate a single level of a system at once. This makes system development and evolution difficult since developers cannot use the same simulator for both high-level algorithm development and low-level development such as device-driver implementations. We propose cross-level simulation, a novel type of wireless sensor network simulation that enables holistic simultaneous simulation at different levels.

Besides typical accounting mechanisms and the emerging area of charging in next generation networks, especially network security solutions rely on efficient and optimized monitoring. Network monitoring in high-speed networks is usually based on flow accounting and aggregation techniques represent a necessary enhancement in order to cope with increasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the ever-growing network capacities. In this paper, we propose a flexible flow aggregation mechanism that can be directly employed on a monitoring probe to reduce the memory and processing demands. Alternatively, it can work as a concentrator that collects flow data from multiple monitoring probes, combines and aggregates them and forwards the results to an analyzer. We verified and evaluated the aggregation mechanism by integrating it into our monitoring probe Vermont. Our approach opens new prospects for high-speed network monitoring and allows coping with special situations that cannot be treated satisfyingly by traditional flow accounting, such as distributed denial-of-service attacks causing very high numbers of flows. Aggregated flow data are an easy-to-handle form of packet information especially for anomaly detection and accounting issues","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Flow Aggregation for Adaptive Network Monitoring","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2006 31st IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2006.322180","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2006 31st IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4116489/4116490/04116641.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2006.322180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4116490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Flow Aggregation for Adaptive Network Monitoring","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4116641/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9420347","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Flow Aggregation for Adaptive Network Monitoring","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"LCN-00-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088605S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4116489","isNumber":"4116490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4116489","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4116490","articleId":"4116641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4116653,"authors":[{"name":"Dijiang Huang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Dijiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37289786600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0418-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0419-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4116653","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Information theory","Mobile computing","Communication systems","Protocols","Peer to peer computing","Computer science","Time measurement","Electronic mail","Communication system traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","mobile communication","packet switching","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless mobile ad-hoc networks","evidence theory based anonymity measurement","probability assignments","packet delivery paths"]}],"abstract":"We propose an evidence theory based anonymity measuring approach for wireless mobile ad-hoc networks.

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging. We are currently exploring labeling flows as suspicious and non-suspicious based on telltales of hosts being compromised","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2006.322210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2006.322210","startPage":"967","endPage":"974","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2006 31st IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4116489/4116490/04116687.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2006 31st IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4116490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Usilng Machine Learning Technliques to Identify Botnet Traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Usilng Machine Learning Technliques to Identify Botnet Traffic","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4116687/","accessionNumber":"9420382","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116687/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Usilng Machine Learning Technliques to Identify Botnet Traffic","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"LCN-00-197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056572S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4116489","isNumber":"4116490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4116489","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4116490","articleId":"4116687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4116705,"authors":[{"name":"Yiping Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/4116696/4116705/4116705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiping Xing (S'03) received the BS degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2001 and the ME degree from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey, in 2004, both in electrical engineering.

With the increasing demand for wireless communication, efficiently using the spectrum resource has become an essential issue. With the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) spectrum policy reform, secondary spectrum sharing has gained increasing interest. One of the policy reforms introduces the concept of an interference temperature - the total allowable interference in a spectral band. This means that secondary users can use different transmit powers as long as the sum of these power is less than the interference threshold. In this paper, we study two problems in secondary spectrum access with minimum signal to interference noise ratio (quality of service (QoS)) guarantee under an interference temperature constraint. First, when all the secondary links can be supported, a nonlinear optimization problem with the objective to maximize the total transmitting rate of the secondary users is formulated. The nonlinear optimization is solved efficiently using geometric programming techniques. The second problem we address is, when not all the secondary links can be supported with their QoS requirement, it is desirable to have the spectrum access opportunity proportional to the user priority if they belong to different priority classes. In this context, we formulate an operator problem which takes the priority issues into consideration. To solve this problem, first, we propose a centralized reduced complexity search algorithm to find the optimal solution. Then, in order to solve this problem distributively, we define a secondary spectrum sharing potential game. The Nash equilibria of this potential game are investigated. The efficiency of the Nash equilibria solutions are characterized. It is shown that distributed sequential play and an algorithm based on stochastic learning attain the equilibrium solutions. Finally, the performances are examined through simulations","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.50","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4116696/04116705.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4116696","startPage":"423","endPage":"433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access with QoS and Interference Temperature Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4116705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access with QoS and Interference Temperature Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4116705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9363084","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4116705/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access with QoS and Interference Temperature Constraints","sourcePdf":"h0423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121845S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4116696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"338","xplore-issue":"4116696","articleId":"4116705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4116717,"authors":[{"name":"I.

As only the mechanical structure of this desktop robot was purchased, the following tasks were undertaken. First, the design and construction of a novel robot controller. Second, the development of a Matlab toolbox that includes: generic robotic functions, specific functions for the Rhino robot, and a three-dimensional computer graphical simulator. Third, the development of a suitable programming environment for robot operation. Fourth, the development of laboratory experiments for teaching robotics. The user interface allows the students to program experiences on robotics, such as, direct and inverse kinematics, manipulation tasks, trajectory following and visual guided movements.

Our 80 test subjects had an even mixture of both aforementioned disciplines. Each participant is asked to listen to a melody played on a piano and to repeat the melody himself verbally. Both the original melody and participants repetition is recorded and frequency and amplitude response is analyzed by using fast Fourier transform (FFT). This information is then used to train a neural network.

The general idea is to modulate the varying envelope signal using squarewave signals with varying width and subsequently drive a class D-type power amplifier. The linearity in the modulator is ensured by a novel combination of low frequency feedback combined with predistortion. Measurements on a frequency wise down-scaled prototype show that the RF-PWM modulator modulates a UMTS signal with more than 17 dB margin to the modulation mask and EVM below 0.5% RMS.

Numerical results have shown that using variance reduction techniques from statistics can result in significant improvements over Monte Carlo sampling in terms of the number of samples needed for convergence of the optimal objective value and optimal solution to a stochastic optimization problem. Among these techniques are stratified sampling and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. However, for problems in high dimension, it may be computationally inefficient to calculate quasi-Monte Carlo point sets in the full dimension. Rather, we wish to identify which dimensions are most important to the convergence and implement a Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling scheme with padding, where the important dimensions are sampled via quasi-Monte Carlo sampling and the remaining dimensions with Monte Carlo sampling. We then incorporate this sampling scheme into an external sampling algorithm (ES-QMCP) to solve stochastic optimization problems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4117570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2006.323158","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4117569/4117570/04117682.pdf","startPage":"774","endPage":"782","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2006.323158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quas-Monte Carlo Strategies for Stochastic Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Quas-Monte Carlo Strategies for Stochastic Optimization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4117682/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9453292","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4117682/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quas-Monte Carlo Strategies for Stochastic Optimization","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WSC-00-112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102132S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4117569","isNumber":"4117570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4117569","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4117570","articleId":"4117682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":4117766,"authors":[{"name":"Michael P.

However, the precision of the real-time data varies depending on the level of data aggregation. For example, minute-by-minute data are more precise than hourly average data. This paper explores the ability to create an accurate estimate of the evolving state of transportation systems using real-time roadway data aggregated at various update intervals. It is found that simulation based on inflow data aggregated over a short time interval is capable of providing a superior representation of the real world over longer aggregate intervals. However, the perceived improvements are minimal under congested conditions and most pronounced under un-congested conditions. In addition, outflow constraints should be considered during congested flow periods, otherwise significant deviation from the real world performance may arise","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4117570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2006.323242","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4117569/4117570/04117766.pdf","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1421","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2006.323242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation of Real-Time Dynamic Data Driven Transportation Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation of Real-Time Dynamic Data Driven Transportation Simulation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4117766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9463297","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4117766/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation of Real-Time Dynamic Data Driven Transportation Simulation","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WSC-00-196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05681S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4117569","isNumber":"4117570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4117569","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4117570","articleId":"4117766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4117838,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Soon Chong","affiliation":["Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["CHIN SOON CHONG obtained his degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the City University of London, UK.

Another issue concerns the inherent coupling between the experimental frame used to measure system response and the system itself. This coupling can lead to an unrealistic simulation of the system in that the data contains the interaction of the system with the experimental frame.

The MIMO channel characterization in different environments and for different operating frequency bands is a crucial factor in the design of new systems and standards, and for adequate planning of existing systems. This article makes two main contributions. First, the experimental characterization of a 2 times 2 MIMO channel at a frequency of 2.4 GHz in a canonical outdoor-indoor scenario is presented. The channel characterization performed includes the analysis of the spatial correlation between the MIMO system subchannels and its impact on the channel capacity. Second, on the basis of the capacity results obtained, a proposal is made for the use of a 2 times 2 MIMO system in outdoor-indoor scenarios for BFWA applications in metropolitan environments. The proposal is based on the experimentally verified hypothesis that the path loss due to building penetration can be practically compensated for by the diversity gain of 2 times 2 systems","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2006.323344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4077879/04117978.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2006.323344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical analysis of a 2 x 2 MIMO channel in outdoor-indoor scenarios for BFWA applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4117978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4117978/","displayDocTitle":"Empirical analysis of a 2 x 2 MIMO channel in outdoor-indoor scenarios for BFWA applications","volume":"48","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9294666","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4117978/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical analysis of a 2 x 2 MIMO channel in outdoor-indoor scenarios for BFWA applications","sourcePdf":"482006-in-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079708S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4077879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4077879","articleId":"4117978","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4118023,"authors":[{"name":"Gonca Cakir","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey","Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engneering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/4077879/4118023/4118023-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":[]},"firstName":"Gonca","lastName":"Cakir","id":"38189074000"},{"name":"Mustafa Cakir","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Cakir","id":"38187355900"},{"name":"Levent Sevgi","affiliation":["Civil Aviation College, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Levent","lastName":"Sevgi","id":"37273499500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9243"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4143"}],"articleNumber":"4118023","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip","Circuit synthesis","Circuit analysis","Finite difference methods","MATLAB","Power engineering and energy","Visualization","Band pass filters","Computer science education","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering education","finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip circuits","network analysis","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual FDTD-based microstrip circuit design","virtual education","research tool","microstrip circuit analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD methods","microstrip circuits","hybrid junctions","impedance matching","filters","bandgap structures","power dividers","bandpass filters","coupling circuits"]}],"abstract":"A novel FDTD-based virtual education/research tool is introduced, and characteristic examples are presented.

The technique generates, from the measured capacitance, a whole volumetric image of the region enclosed by the geometrically three-dimensional capacitance sensor. This development enables a real-time, 3-D imaging of a moving object or a real-time volume imaging (4-D) to be realized. Moreover, it allows total interrogation of the whole volume within the domain (vessel or conduit) of an arbitrary shape or geometry. The development of the ECVT imaging technique primarily encloses the 3-D capacitance sensor design and the volume image reconstruction technique. The electrical field variation in three-dimensional space forms a basis for volume imaging through different shapes and configurations of ECT sensor electrodes. The image reconstruction scheme is established by implementing the neural-network multicriterion optimization image reconstruction (NN-MOIRT), developed earlier by the authors for the 2-D ECT. The image reconstruction technique is modified by introducing into the algorithm a 3-D sensitivity matrix to replace the 2-D sensitivity matrix in conventional 2-D ECT, and providing additional network constraints including 3-to-2-D image matching function. The additional constraints further enhance the accuracy of the image reconstruction algorithm.

The narrow notched (rejection) band was introduced by using a new technique which involves embedding open stubs in the first and last connecting lines in order to reject any undesired existing radio signal which may interfere with the determined UWB passband. The bandwidth of the notched filter can be controlled by adjusting the width of the stubs or the gaps or both. The length of the stubs can be tuned to select a specific frequency for the notched band. The embedded stubs can be used to excite single or double band-reject response.

This shift in behavior is controlled by the input statistic and by a single time constant. The learning rule has been implemented in a neuromorphic very large scale integration (VLSI) chip as part of a neurally inspired spike signal image processing system. The latter is the result of the European Union research project Convolution AER Vision Architecture for Real-Time (CAVIAR). Since it is implemented as a spike-based learning rule (which is most convenient in the overall spike-based system), even if it is tuned to show rate behavior, no explicit long term average signals are computed on the chip.

On the basis of decomposition and coordination strategy for interconnected dynamic systems, the proposed neural network has a two-level hierarchical structure: several local optimization subnetworks at the lower level and one coordination subnetwork at the upper level. A goal-coordination method is used to coordinate the interactions between the subsystems. By nesting the dynamic equations of the subsystems into their corresponding local optimization subnetworks, the number of dimensions of the neural network can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, the subnetworks at both the lower and upper levels can work concurrently. Therefore, the computation efficiency, in comparison with the consecutive executions of numerical algorithms on digital computers, is increased dramatically. The proposed method is extended to the case where the control inputs of the subsystems are bounded. The stability analysis shows that the proposed neural network is asymptotically stable.

Typically, face representations obtained by ICA involve unsupervised learning and high-order statistics. In this paper, we develop an enhancement of the generic ICA by augmenting this method by the Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA); hence, its abbreviation, FICA. The FICA is systematically developed and presented along with its underlying architecture. A comparative analysis explores four distance metrics, as well as classification with support vector machines (SVMs). We demonstrate that the FICA approach leads to the formation of well-separated classes in low-dimension subspace and is endowed with a great deal of insensitivity to large variation in illumination and facial expression. The comprehensive experiments are completed for the facial-recognition technology (FERET) face database; a comparative analysis demonstrates that FICA comes with improved classification rates when compared with some other conventional approaches such as eigenface, fisherface, and the ICA itself","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Using an Enhanced Independent Component Analysis Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.885436","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4118251/04118266.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.885436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Using an Enhanced Independent Component Analysis Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4118266/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9350545","pubMedId":"17385637","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Using an Enhanced Independent Component Analysis Approach","sourcePdf":"18tnn02-kwak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147812S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4118251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4118251","articleId":"4118266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4118267,"authors":[{"name":"Marios Kyperountas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4118251/4118267/4118267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marios Kyperountas received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Florida Atlantic University (FAU), Boca Raton, in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

The algorithm is applied to similarity, or matching error, data and provides a general solution for overcoming the \"small sample size\" (SSS) problem, where the lack of sufficient training samples causes improper estimation of a linear separation hyperplane between the classes. Two independent phases constitute the proposed method. Initially, a set of weighted piecewise discriminant hyperplanes are used in order to provide a more accurate discriminant decision than the one produced by the traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) methodology. The expected classification ability of this method is investigated throughout a series of simulations. The second phase defines proper combinations for person-specific similarity scores and describes an outlier removal process that further enhances the classification ability.

The feedback layers provide local and global recurrences via nonlinear processing elements. In these feedback layers, weighted sums of the delayed outputs of the hidden and of the output layers are passed through certain activation functions and applied to the feedforward neurons via adjustable weights. Both online and offline training procedures based on the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm are developed. The adjoint model of the MFLNN is built to compute the derivatives with respect to the MFLNN weights which are then used in the training procedures. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method with a trust region approach is used to update the MFLNN weights. The performance of the MFLNN is demonstrated by applying to several illustrative temporal problems including chaotic time series prediction and nonlinear dynamic system identification, and it performed better than several networks available in the literature","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.885439","startPage":"373","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.885439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4118251/04118279.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multifeedback-Layer Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118279/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multifeedback-Layer Neural Network","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4118279/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9350534","pubMedId":"17385626","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multifeedback-Layer Neural Network","sourcePdf":"18tnn02-savran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10399S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4118251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4118251","articleId":"4118279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4118281,"authors":[{"name":"Rashad Sharaf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Rashad","lastName":"Sharaf","id":"37267896700"},{"name":"Aboelmagd Noureldin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Aboelmagd","lastName":"Noureldin","id":"37267892700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4118281","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":733},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118281","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite navigation systems","Neural networks","Global Positioning System","Vehicles","Intelligent sensors","Artificial intelligence","Inertial navigation","Kalman filters","Filtering","Accelerometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","inertial navigation","radial basis function networks","road vehicles","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor integration","satellite based vehicular navigation","radial basis function neural networks","land vehicles","global positioning system","inertial sensors","data fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NNs)","data fusion","global positioning system (GPS)","inertial navigation","Kalman filtering"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Geographic Information Systems","Motor Vehicles","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Spacecraft","Systems Integration","Transducers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.890811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4118251/04118281.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.890811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor Integration for Satellite-Based Vehicular Navigation Using Neural Networks","abstract":"Land vehicles rely mainly on global positioning system (GPS) to provide their position with consistent accuracy.

In this paper, a novel hierarchical structure for complex temporal sequence learning is proposed. Hierarchical organization, a prediction mechanism, and one-shot learning characterize the model. In the lowest level of the hierarchy, we use a modified Hebbian learning mechanism for pattern recognition. Our model employs both active 0 and active 1 sensory inputs. A winner-take-all (WTA) mechanism is used to select active neurons that become the input for sequence learning at higher hierarchical levels. Prediction is an essential element of our temporal sequence learning model. By correct prediction, the machine indicates it knows the current sequence and does not require additional learning. When the prediction is incorrect, one-shot learning is executed and the machine learns the new input sequence as soon as the sequence is completed. A four-level hierarchical structure that isolates letters, words, sentences, and strophes is used in this paper to illustrate the model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9350532","pubMedId":"17385624","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4118284/","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Anticipation-Based Temporal Sequences Learning in Hierarchical Structure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anticipation-Based Temporal Sequences Learning in Hierarchical Structure","sourcePdf":"18tnn02-starzyk2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061248S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4118251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4118251","articleId":"4118284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4118286,"authors":[{"name":"Sitao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4118251/4118286/4118286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sitao Wu received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, P.R.

The proposed nine-level converter uses only eight MOSFETs. Unlike conventional PWM, the NPE PWM does not generate excessively narrow pulses, so that power semiconductors nonideal delays and switching times are still negligible. Therefore, the nine-level output voltage THD, mostly introduced in the power stage, is strongly reduced. With the NPE technique, the resolution of the generated PWM is no longer limited by the switching speed of the output switches, but only by the frequency of digital processing circuit. Simulation and experimental results from a laboratory prototype are presented in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2006.889912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2006.889912","startPage":"425","endPage":"434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4118287/04118288.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow Pulse Elimination PWM for Multilevel Digital Audio Power Amplifiers Using Two Cascaded H-Bridges as a Nine-Level Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Narrow Pulse Elimination PWM for Multilevel Digital Audio Power Amplifiers Using Two Cascaded H-Bridges as a Nine-Level Converter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4118288/","accessionNumber":"9348767","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118288/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow Pulse Elimination PWM for Multilevel Digital Audio Power Amplifiers Using Two Cascaded H-Bridges as a Nine-Level Converter","sourcePdf":"22tpel02-antunes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062418S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4118287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4118287","articleId":"4118288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4118290,"authors":[{"name":"Angus T.

In an effort to decrease cost and increase ease of implementation, the commutation signals are obtained without the motor neutral voltage, multistage analog filters, A/D converters, or the complex digital phase shift (delay) circuits which are indispensable in the conventional sensorless control algorithms. In the proposed method, instead of detecting the zero crossing point of the nonexcited motor back electromagnetic force (EMF) or the average motor terminal to neutral voltage, the commutation signals are extracted directly from the specific average line to line voltages with simple RC circuits and comparators. In contrast to conventional methods, the neutral voltage is not needed; therefore, the commutation signals are insensitive to the common mode noise. Moreover, the complex phase shift circuit can be eliminated. As a result, the proposed control algorithm can be easily interfaced with the cost effective commercial Hall effect sensor based commutation integrated circuits. Due to its inherent low cost, the proposed control algorithm is particularly suitable for cost sensitive products such as air purifiers, air blowers, cooling fans, and related home appliances.

In these conditions, dangerous leakage currents (common-mode currents) can appear through the stray capacitance between the PV array and the ground. In order to avoid these leakage currents, different inverter topologies that generate no varying common-mode voltages, such as the half-bridge and the bipolar pulsewidth modulation (PWM) full-bridge topologies, have been proposed. The need of a high-input voltage represents an important drawback of the half-bridge. The bipolar PWM full bridge requires a lower input voltage but exhibits a low efficiency. This letter proposes a new high-efficiency topology that generates no varying common-mode voltage and requires the same low-input voltage as the bipolar PWM full bridge.

recent single-stage topological solutions proposed for buck-boost energy conversion with all favorable advantages of three-level switching retained. Despite their effectiveness in achieving voltage buck-boost conversion, existing three-level Z-source inverters use two LC impedance networks and two isolated dc sources, which can significantly increase the overall system cost and require a more complex modulator for balancing the network inductive voltage boosting. Offering a number of less costly alternatives, this letter presents the design and control of two three-level Z-source inverters, whose output voltage can be stepped down or up using only a single LC impedance network connected between the dc input source and either a neutral-point-clamped (NPC) or dc-link cascaded inverter circuitry. Through careful design of their modulation scheme, both inverters can function with the minimum of six device commutations per half carrier cycle (similar to that needed by a traditional buck three-level NPC inverter), while producing the correct volt-sec average and inductive voltage boosting at their ac output terminals. Physically, the designed modulation scheme can conveniently be implemented using a generic \"alternative phase opposition disposition\" carrier-based modulator with the appropriate triplen offset and time advance/delay added. The designed inverters, having a reduced passive component count, are lastly tested in simulation and experimentally using a laboratory prototype with the captured results presented in a later section of the letter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9337271","htmlLink":"/document/4118325/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Three-Level Z-Source Inverters Using a Single <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Impedance Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Level Z-Source Inverters Using a Single <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Impedance Network","sourcePdf":"22tpel02-ploh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043542S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4118287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"4118287","articleId":"4118325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4118327,"authors":[{"name":"Nagaraju Pogaku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4118287/4118327/4118327-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nagaraju Pogaku (S'04) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Osmania University, Hyderabad, India, in 2000, the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering (with a specialization in power electronics and power systems) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, in 2003, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Imperial College, London, U.K.","His research interests include distributed generation, microgrids, application of power electronics to power systems, and power system deregulation."]},"firstName":"Nagaraju","lastName":"Pogaku","id":"37946814300"},{"name":"Milan Prodanovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4118287/4118327/4118327-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Milan Prodanovi\u0107 (M'01) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 1996 and the Ph.D. degree from Imperial College, London, U.K., in 2004.","He is currently a Research Associate at Imperial College.

This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed \"modes\") indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models.

Since the dynamic characteristics and motor parameters of the LPCM are highly nonlinear and time varying, a TSGAC system is therefore investigated based on direction-based genetic algorithm with the spirit of total sliding-mode control (TSC) and fuzzy-based evolutionary procedure to achieve high-precision position control under a wide operation range. In this control scheme, a GAC system is utilized to be the major controller, and the stability can be indirectly ensured by the concept of TSC without strict constraints and detailed system knowledge. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed drive and control system is verified by numerical simulations and experimental results in the presence of uncertainties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9337254","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4118333/","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of Total Sliding-Mode-Based Genetic Algorithm Control for Hybrid Resonant-Driven Linear Piezoelectric Ceramic Motor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Total Sliding-Mode-Based Genetic Algorithm Control for Hybrid Resonant-Driven Linear Piezoelectric Ceramic Motor","sourcePdf":"22tpel02-wai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091265S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4118287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4118287","articleId":"4118333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4118365,"authors":[{"name":"Joe Smetana","affiliation":["Advanced Technology, Plano, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6104/4118341/4118365/4118365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joe Smetana is a Principal Engineer with Advanced Technology, Alcatel, Plano, TX, and a Distinguished Member of the Technical Staff of the Alcatel Technical Academy.

First, to achieve high-bandwidth current control characteristics, an improved deadbeat current controller with delay compensation is adopted. The compensation method forces the delay elements, which are caused by voltage calculation, PWM, and synchronous frame rotation, to be equivalently placed outside the closed-loop control system. Hence, their effect on the closed-loop stability is eliminated, and the current controller can be designed with a higher bandwidth. Second, to relax the parameter sensitivity issue of the deadbeat controller and to realize a control scheme with reduced sensors, a novel adaptive self-tuning load model is emerged in the control structure. The adaptive model is designed with low computational demand to estimate in real time the load parameters (R,L) and the back-electromotive-force voltage simultaneously. A unified solution to the present nonlinear estimation problem is presented by adopting a parallel observer structure. Furthermore, the adaptive model has the necessary phase advance of the estimated quantities, which compensates for the total system's delay.

For an application requiring regenerative capability, each power cell must be constructed with a three- or single-phase pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) rectifier as front end. The choice of single-phase PWM rectifiers for the input of the cells results in a reduced number of power switches and a simpler input transformer than the three-phase equivalent. However, its control is not as straightforward. This paper proposes the use of higher order resonant controllers in the classical control structure of the single-phase PWM rectifier.

The dynamic PD allows an adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACPR) improvement of 15.7 dB, which is superior to conventional PDs that linearize static AM-AM and AM-PM. The dynamic PD was designed using an HBT generating nonlinearity, a short circuit at the baseband (les4 MHz), and a load circuit for the HBT at the RF fundamental band (ap1.95 GHz). Volterra-series analysis was performed to understand the mechanism of the dynamic PD. The analysis revealed that the short circuit at the baseband enabled the dynamic PD generating third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) with opposite phase to the fundamental tone (i.e., antiphase IMD3). The antiphase IMD3 allows dynamic gain compression, which linearizes the dynamic gain expansion of a PA with low quiescent current. The analysis also revealed that the IMD3 amplitude of the dynamic PD can be adjusted by load impedance at the RF fundamental band, which enables the gradient of dynamic AM-AM and AM-PM to be optimized to linearize the PA.

Such systems describe, for example, the controlled dynamics of a rigid body. His main controllability theorem applied the concept of finiteness embodied in the Hilbert basis theorem to develop a controllability condition which could be verified by checking the rank of an explicit finite dimensional operator. During the mid-1980s, Baillieul collaborated with M. Levi to develop a control theory for rotating elastic systems. Recently, he has written a number of papers on motion planning and control of kinematically redundant manipulators, and he has become interested in problems associated with anholonomy in planning motions for robots which have elastic joints and other components which store energy. Much of his present research is devoted to applying the methods of dynamical systems theory and classical geometric nonlinear control theory to problems of current technological interest. In particular, he is working on applications of mathematical control theory to fluid structure interactions, microelectromechanism dynamics, adaptive optics, and network mediated control of large scale device arrays. Recent developments in this research has led him to work on the interplay between communications and information theory and control."]},"firstName":"John","lastName":"Baillieul","id":"37265825600"},{"name":"Panos J.

Network protocol stacks may instead be holistically analyzed and systematically designed as distributed solutions to some global optimization problems. This paper presents a survey of the recent efforts towards a systematic understanding of layering as optimization decomposition, where the overall communication network is modeled by a generalized network utility maximization problem, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem, and the interfaces among layers are quantified as functions of the optimization variables coordinating the subproblems. There can be many alternative decompositions, leading to a choice of different layering architectures. This paper surveys the current status of horizontal decomposition into distributed computation, and vertical decomposition into functional modules such as congestion control, routing, scheduling, random access, power control, and channel coding. Key messages and methods arising from many recent works are summarized, and open issues discussed.

Such a localization process might include prediction of future target location, recalling a sequence of previously visited places or, for the motor control circuit, actuating a successful movement. Typically, target localization is carried out by fusing images from two eyes, in the case of binocular vision, wherein the challenge is to have the images calibrated before fusion. In the field of machine vision, a typical problem of interest is to localize the position and orientation of a network of mobile cameras (sensor network) that are distributed in space and are simultaneously tracking a target. Inspired by the animal visual circuit, we study the problem of binocular image fusion for the purpose of localizing an unknown target in space. Guided by the dynamics of \"eye rotation\", we introduce control strategies that could be used to build machines with multiple sensors. In particular, we address the problem of how a group of visual sensors can be optimally controlled in a formation. We also address how images from multiple sensors are encoded using a set of basis functions, choosing a \"larger than minimum\" number of basis functions so that the resulting code that represents the image is sparse. We address the problem of how a sparsely encoded visual data stream is internally represented by a pattern of neural activity. In addition to the control mechanism, the synaptic interaction between cells is also subjected to \"adaptation\" that enables the activity waves to respond with greater sensitivity to visual input. We study how the rat hippocampal place cells are used to form a cognitive map of the environment so that the animal's location can be determined from its place cell activity. Finally, we study the problem of \"decoding\" location of moving targets from the neural activity wave in the cortex","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118464/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","volume":"95","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9340501","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bio-Inspired Networks of Visual Sensors, Neurons, and Oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-Inspired Networks of Visual Sensors, Neurons, and Oscillators","sourcePdf":"95jproc01-ghosh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071722S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","isNumber":"4118453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4118464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4118465,"authors":[{"name":"Joo P.

At lower levels in the factory infrastructure, networks provide higher reliability, visibility, and diagnosability, and enable capabilities such as distributed control, diagnostics, safety, and device interoperability. At higher levels, networks can leverage internet services to enable factory-wide automated scheduling, control, and diagnostics; improve data storage and visibility; and open the door to e-manufacturing. This paper explores current trends in the use of networks for distributed, multilevel control, diagnostics, and safety. Network performance characteristics such as delay, delay variability, and determinism are evaluated in the context of networked control applications. This paper also discusses future networking trends in each of these categories and describes the actual application of all three categories of networks on a reconfigurable factory testbed (RFT) at the University of Michigan. Control, diagnostics, and safety systems are all enabled in the RFT utilizing multitier networked technology including DeviceNet, PROFIBUS, OPC, wired and wireless Ethernet, and SafetyBUS p.

Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms.

We highlight the importance of a new class of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for network-centric military urban operations. We review some of the UAVs that have been developed in recent years, and that are under development, with particular attention to their endurance, portability, performance, payload, and communication capabilities. Selected university testbeds are also briefly noted. Over the last few years there has been considerable research focused on how these small UAVs, both individually and collectively, can operate autonomously in urban environments and help capture and communicate needed information. We discuss some of this research; specific topics covered include guidance and control for autonomous operation, multi-UAV coordination and route optimization, and ad-hoc networking with UAV nodes.

In contrast to traditional control and estimation problems, here the observation and control packets may be lost or delayed. The unreliability of the underlying communication network is modeled stochastically by assigning probabilities to the successful transmission of packets. This requires a novel theory which generalizes classical control/estimation paradigms. The paper offers the foundations of such a novel theory. The central contribution is to characterize the impact of the network reliability on the performance of the feedback loop. Specifically, it is shown that for network protocols where successful transmissions of packets is acknowledged at the receiver (e.g., TCP-like protocols), there exists a critical threshold of network reliability (i.e., critical probabilities for the successful delivery of packets), below which the optimal controller fails to stabilize the system. Further, for these protocols, the separation principle holds and the optimal LQG controller is a linear function of the estimated state. In stark contrast, it is shown that when there is no acknowledgement of successful delivery of control packets (e.g., UDP-like protocols), the LQG optimal controller is in general nonlinear. Consequently, the separation principle does not hold in this circumstance","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2006.887306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2006.887306","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4118453/04118476.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foundations of Control and Estimation Over Lossy Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Foundations of Control and Estimation Over Lossy Networks","volume":"95","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9340500","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118476/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Foundations of Control and Estimation Over Lossy Networks","sourcePdf":"95jproc01-schenato.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076027S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","isNumber":"4118453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"929","articleId":"4118476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4118486,"authors":[{"name":"David Borland","affiliation":["University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Borland","id":"37295624700"},{"name":"Russell M.

Several attacks on symmetric and public-key cryptosystems have been described in the literature and some dedicated error-detection techniques have been proposed to foil them. The proposed techniques are ad hoc ones and exploit specific properties of the cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we propose a general framework for error detection in symmetric ciphers based on an operation-centered approach. We first enumerate the arithmetic and logic operations included in the cipher and analyze the efficacy and hardware complexity of several error-detecting codes for each such operation.

This paper explores the benefits of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) for power management in server farms. Unlike previous work, which addressed DVS on individual servers and on load-balanced server replicas, this paper addresses DVS in multistage service pipelines. Contemporary Web server installations typically adopt a three-tier architecture in which the first tier presents a Web interface, the second executes scripts that implement business logic, and the third serves database accesses. From a user's perspective, only the end-to-end response across the entire pipeline is relevant. This paper presents a rigorous optimization methodology and an algorithm for minimizing the total energy expenditure of the multistage pipeline subject to soft end-to-end response-time constraints. A distributed power management service is designed and evaluated on a real three-tier server prototype for coordinating DVS settings in a way that minimizes global energy consumption while meeting end-to-end delay constraints. The service is shown to consume as much as 30 percent less energy compared to the default (Linux) energy saving policy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4118665/04118669.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.1003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.1003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Voltage Scaling in Multitier Web Servers with End-to-End Delay Control","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","network servers","pipeline processing","power aware computing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic voltage scaling","multitier Web server","end-to-end delay control","power management","load-balanced server","multistage service pipeline processing","three-tier architecture","distributed power management service","global energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power management","voltage control","soft real-time systems","network servers","pipeline processing","distributed algorithms","optimization methods."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Voltage Scaling in Multitier Web Servers with End-to-End Delay Control","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4118669/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9435134","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Voltage Scaling in Multitier Web Servers with End-to-End Delay Control","sourcePdf":"t0444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138412S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4118665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"4118665","articleId":"4118669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4118671,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Zhigang Wang","affiliation":["Centre for Grid Computing, Cambridge-Cranfield High Performance Computing Facility,AMAC/SOE, Cranfield University, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4118665/4118671/4118671-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frank Zhigang Wang received the PhD degree in information technology from the University of Plymouth in 1999.

As an FTP server, GOS with a slimmed OS, with a total volume of around 150 MB, outperforms the standard GridFTP by 20-40 percent. As a file server, GOS-FS acts as a network/grid interface, enabling a user to perform searches and access resources without downloading them locally. In the real-world tests between Cambridge and Beijing, where the transfer distance is 10,000 km, the multistreamed GOS-FS file opening/saving resulted in a remarkable performance increase of about 2-25 times, compared to the single-streamed network file system (NFSv4).

This motivates interests in new computing models. One such model is called error tolerance. Classically, during the postmanufacturing test process, chips are classified as being bad (defective) or good. The main premise in error-tolerant computing is that some bad chips that fail classical go/no-go tests and do indeed occasionally produce erroneous results actually provide acceptable performance in some applications. Thus, new test techniques are needed to classify bad chips according to categories based upon their degree, of acceptability with respect to predetermined applications. One classification criterion is error rate. In this paper, we first describe a simple test structure that is a minor extension to current scan-test and built-in self-test structures and that can be used to estimate the error rate of a circuit. We then address three theoretical issues. First, we develop an elegant mathematical model that describes the key parameters associated with this test process and incorporates bounds on the error in estimating error rate and the level of confidence in this estimate. Next, we present an efficient testing procedure for estimating the error rate of a circuit under test. Finally, we address the problem of assigning bad chips to bins based on their error rate. We show that this can be done in an efficient, hence cost-effective, way and discuss the quality of our results in terms of such concepts as increase effective yield, yield loss, and test escape","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.1017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4141231/04118682.pdf","startPage":"650","endPage":"661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.1017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4141231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Error Rate in Defective Logic Using Signature Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118682/","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Error Rate in Defective Logic Using Signature Analysis","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9435151","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4118682/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Error Rate in Defective Logic Using Signature Analysis","sourcePdf":"t0650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092902S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4141231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4141231","articleId":"4118682","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4118686,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Zhuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4118683/4118686/4118686-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ling Zhuo received the bachelor's degree in engineering from Tsinghua University in 2000.

In this paper, we study designs for floating-point matrix multiplication, a fundamental kernel in a number of scientific applications, on reconfigurable computing systems. We first analyze design trade-offs in implementing this kernel. These trade-offs are caused by the inherent parallelism of matrix multiplication and the resource constraints, including the number of configurable slices, the size of on-chip memory, and the available memory bandwidth. We propose three parameterized algorithms which can be tuned according to the problem size and the available hardware resources. Our algorithms employ linear array architecture with simple control logic. This architecture effectively utilizes the available resources and reduces routing complexity. The processing elements (PEs) used in our algorithms are modular so that it is easy to embed floating-point units into them. Experimental results on a Xilinx Virtex-ll Pro XC2VP100 show that our algorithms achieve good scalability and high sustained GFLOPS performance. We also implement our algorithms on Cray XD1.

The system collects locally-generated peer feedbacks and aggregates them to yield the global reputation scores. Surprisingly, most previous work ignored the distribution of peer feedbacks. We use a trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among peers. After examining the eBay transaction trace of over 10,000 users, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. Our mathematical analysis justifies that power-law distribution is applicable to any dynamically growing P2P systems, either structured or unstructured. We develop a robust and scalable P2P reputation system, PowerTrust, to leverage the power-law feedback characteristics. The PowerTrust system dynamically selects small number of power nodes that are most reputable using a distributed ranking mechanism. By using a look-ahead random walk strategy and leveraging the power nodes, PowerTrust significantly improves in global reputation accuracy and aggregation speed. PowerTrust is adaptable to dynamics in peer joining and leaving and robust to disturbance by malicious peers. Through P2P network simulation experiments, we find significant performance gains in using PowerTrust. This power-law guided reputation system design proves to achieve high query success rate in P2P file-sharing applications. The system also reduces the total job makespan and failure rate in large-scale, parameter-sweeping P2P Grid applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PowerTrust: A Robust and Scalable Reputation System for Trusted Peer-to-Peer Computing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1021","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4118683/04118688.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"PowerTrust: A Robust and Scalable Reputation System for Trusted Peer-to-Peer Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4118688/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PowerTrust: A Robust and Scalable Reputation System for Trusted Peer-to-Peer Computing","sourcePdf":"l0460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08038S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4118683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"471","xplore-issue":"4118683","articleId":"4118688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4118689,"authors":[{"name":"Eunjin Jung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4118683/4118689/4118689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eunjin (EJ) Jung graduated from Seoul National University in 1999 and received the MS and PhD degrees in computer sciences from the University of Texas at Austin in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

The issued certificates in a network constitute a set of certificate chains between users. A user u can obtain the public key of another user v from a certificate chain from u to v in the network. For the certificate chain from u to v, u is called the source of the chain and v is called the destination of the chain. Certificates in each chain are dispersed between the source and destination of the chain such that the following condition holds. If any user u needs to securely send messages to any other user v in the network, then u can use the certificates stored in u and v to obtain the public key of v (then u can use the public key of v to set up a shared key with v to securely send messages to v). The cost of dispersing certificates in a set of chains among the source and destination users in a network is measured by the total number of certificates that need to be stored in all users. A dispersal of a set of certificate chains in a network is optimal if no other dispersal of the same chain set has a strictly lower cost. In this paper, we show that the problem of computing optimal dispersal of a given chain set is NP-complete. Thus, minimizing the total number of certificates stored in all users is NP-complete. We identify three special classes of chain sets that are of practical interests and devise three polynomial-time algorithms that compute optimal dispersals for each class.

In the context of middleware systems, new algorithms to answer top-k queries have been recently proposed. Among these, the threshold algorithm (TA) is the most well-known instance due to its simplicity and memory requirements. TA is based on an early-termination condition and can evaluate top-k queries without examining all the tuples. This top-k query model is prevalent not only over middleware systems, but also over plain relational data. In this work, we analyze the challenges that must be addressed to adapt TA to a relational database system. We show that, depending on the available indices, many alternative TA strategies can be used to answer a given query. Choosing the best alternative requires a cost model that can be seamlessly integrated with that of current optimizers. In this work, we address these challenges and conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of the resulting techniques by characterizing which scenarios can take advantage of TA-like algorithms to answer top-k queries in relational database systems","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.1011","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4118700/04118709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.1011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"523","endPage":"537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Threshold Algorithm: From Middleware Systems to the Relational Engine","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4118709/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9415650","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Threshold Algorithm: From Middleware Systems to the Relational Engine","sourcePdf":"k0523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098293S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4118700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4118700","articleId":"4118709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4118712,"authors":[{"name":"Dacheng Tao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Systems, Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4118700/4118712/4118712-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dacheng Tao received the BEng degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), the MPhil degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and the PhD degree from the University of London (UoL).

In many applications, it is reasonable to assume that all the positive samples are alike and thus that the region of the feature space occupied by the positive samples can be described by a single hypersurface. However, for the negative samples, previous RF methods either treat each one of the negative samples as an isolated point or assume the whole negative set can be described by a single convex hypersurface. In this paper, we argue that these treatments of the negative samples are not sound. Our belief is all positive samples are included in a set and the negative samples split into a small number of subsets, each one of which has a simple distribution. Therefore, we first cluster the negative samples into several groups; for each such negative group, we build a marginal convex machine (MCM) subclassifier between it and the single positive group which results in a series of subclassifiers. These subclassifiers are then incorporated into a biased MCM (BMCM) for RF. Experiments were carried out to prove the advantages of BMCM-based RF over previous methods for RF","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Negative feedback","Radio frequency","Support vector machines","Image retrieval","Kernel","Support vector machine classification","Content based retrieval","Feedback loop","Boosting","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","image classification","image retrieval","pattern clustering","relevance feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative sample analysis","relevance feedback","content-based image retrieval","online binary classifier","single convex hypersurface","marginal convex machine subclassifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content-based image retrieval (CBIR)","relevance feedback (RF)","marginal convex machine (MCM)","biased marginal convex machine (BMCM)","kernel marginal convex machine (KMCM)","kernel biased marginal convex machine (KBMCM)."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.1003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4118700/04118712.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.1003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative Samples Analysis in Relevance Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Negative Samples Analysis in Relevance Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118712/","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4118712/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9415653","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative Samples Analysis in Relevance Feedback","sourcePdf":"k0568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073003S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4118700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4118700","articleId":"4118712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":4118734,"authors":[{"name":"David Hubbard","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hubbard","id":"37294469400"},{"name":"Bryan Morse","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Bryan","lastName":"Morse","id":"37283072200"},{"name":"Colin Theodore","affiliation":["Ames Research Center, San Jose State University Foundation, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Theodore","id":"37294469600"},{"name":"Mark Tischler","affiliation":["Ames Research Center, U.S. Army Aero flight dynamics Directorate, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Tischler","id":"37294472200"},{"name":"Timothy McLain","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"McLain","id":"37294472600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5790"}],"articleNumber":"4118734","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Global Positioning System","Aircraft navigation","Testing","Tracking","Cameras","Military aircraft","Motion estimation","Performance evaluation","Position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace testing","aircraft navigation","computer vision","control engineering computing","correlation methods","helicopters","laser ranging","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","vision-based navigation","vision-based landing","rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle","rotorcraft UAV","flight test","US Army PALACE project","Moravec pseudo normalized correlation tracking algorithm","laser range","aircraft attitude","relative motion","GPS equivalent","position estimation"]}],"abstract":"A rotorcraft UAV provides an ideal experimental platform for vision-based navigation.

Our system first captures the video of an IM train, and applies image processing and machine learning techniques developed in this work to identify the various types of loads as containers and trailers. The whole process relies on a sequence of following tasks -robust background subtraction in each frame of the video, estimation of train velocity, creation of mosaic of the whole train from the video and classification of train loads into containers and trailers.

This problem is so called the small sample size (SSS) problem. In order to solve this problem, a new supervised learning method called two-dimensional CCA (2DCCA) is developed in this paper. Different from traditional CCA method, 2DCCA directly extracts the features from image matrix rather than matrix-to-vector transformation. In practice, the covariance matrix extracted by 2DCCA is always full rank. Hence the small sample size (SSS) problem can be effectively dealt with by this new developed method. The theory foundation of 2DCCA method is firstly developed, and the construction method for the class-membership matrix Y which is used to precisely represent the relationship between samples and classes in the 2DCCA framework is then clarified. Simultaneously, the analytic form of the generalized inverse of such class-membership matrix is derived. From our experiment results on face recognition, we clearly find that not only the SSS problem can be effectively solved, but also better recognition performance than several other CCA based methods has been achieved","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4118721/4118722/04118772.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV '07)","doi":"10.1109/WACV.2007.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WACV.2007.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2DCCA: A Novel Method for Small Sample Size Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Covariance matrix","Feature extraction","Multidimensional systems","Principal component analysis","Sun","Supervised learning","Multidimensional signal processing","Biomedical imaging","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","covariance matrices","face recognition","feature extraction","matrix inversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","2D canonical correlation analysis","small sample size problem","feature extraction","image matrix","covariance matrix","class-membership matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"2DCCA: A Novel Method for Small Sample Size Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4118772/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9365779","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2DCCA: A Novel Method for Small Sample Size Face Recognition","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"27940043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068931S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4118721","isNumber":"4118722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4118721","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4118722","articleId":"4118772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4118815,"authors":[{"name":"Deborah Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Deborah","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37289926700"},{"name":"Kevin W.

The analysis proceeds by creating a generation system model for each group. The models of the unconventional groups are modified hourly depending on the limitations of energy. All the models are combined hourly to find the loss of load expectation and the frequency of capacity deficiency for the hour in question. This procedure is accomplished using a discrete state algorithm as well as the method of cumulants.

The constraints are the operating limits of the control variables, power line flows, and bus voltages.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1985.323466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4118829/04118854.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1985.323466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118829","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A United Approach to Optimal Real and Reactive Power Dispatch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A United Approach to Optimal Real and Reactive Power Dispatch","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4118854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-104","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1985","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A United Approach to Optimal Real and Reactive Power Dispatch","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-104-n5-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067784S","chronDate":"May  1985","isNumber":"4118829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"392","articleId":"4118854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4118855,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The stopping set analysis is performed on the cyclically lifted code ensemble assuming uniformly random lifting sequences, and the suppressing effect/weight of the cyclic lifting is identified for the first time, based on which the ensemble FER error floor can be analytically determined and a scaling law is derived. BoUe the first-order and high-order suppressing effects are discussed and quantified by different methods including the explicit expression, an algorithmic upper bound, and an algebraic lower bound. The mismatch between the suppressing weight and the stopping distances explains the dramatic performance discrepancy among different cyclically lifted codes when the underlying base codes have degree 2 variable nodes or not. For the former case, a degree augmentation method is further introduced to mitigate this metric mismatch, and a systematic method of constructing irregular codes of low FER error floors is presented. Both regular and irregular codes of very low FER error floors are reported, for which the improvement factor ranges from 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n - 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4 </sup>\n when compared to the classic graph-based code ensembles","doi":"10.1109/ITW2.2006.323762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW2.2006.323762","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","pdfPath":"/iel5/4119225/4119226/04119260.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4119226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code Annealing and the Suppressing Effect of the Cyclically Lifted LDPC Code Ensemble","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4119260/","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Code Annealing and the Suppressing Effect of the Cyclically Lifted LDPC Code Ensemble","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9475883","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4119260/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code Annealing and the Suppressing Effect of the Cyclically Lifted LDPC Code Ensemble","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ITW2-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096086S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4119225","isNumber":"4119226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4119225","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4119226","articleId":"4119260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4119261,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Chatzigeorgiou","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Chatzigeorgiou","id":"37296788500"},{"name":"Miguel R.

The Declercq and Fossorier's algorithm speeds up the computation by reducing the number of configurations, while our algorithm uses the dynamic programming instead. Compared with the configuration reduction algorithm, the dynamic programming one is simpler at the design stage because it has less parameters to tune. Furthermore, it does not have the performance degradation problem caused by the configuration reduction because it searches the whole configuration space efficiently through dynamic programming.

Then, we show that the lower bound of Kashyap and Vardy on the stopping distance of an LDPC code is also a lower bound on the pseudo-weight of a pseudo-codeword of this LDPC code with girth 4, and this lower bound is tight if and only if this pseudo-codeword is a real multiple of a codeword. Using these results we further show that for some LDPC codes, there are no other minimum pseudo-codewords except the real multiples of minimum codewords. This means that LP decoding for these LDPC codes is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the ratio of the probabilities of decoding errors of LP decoding and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding approaches to 1 as the signal-to-noise ratio leads to infinity.

Over a Binary Erasure Channel, RS codes perform with optimal results and approach the maximum channel capacity. In this paper, we apply RS codes to packet wireless transmission over the uncorrelated flat Rayleigh fading channel. It is shown that by using an RS code concatenated with BCH codes and using hard decisions, better results are obtained than using bit interleaved LDPC codes, with soft-decision decoding. The BCH code is used to correct small numbers of errors due to noise and also to detect the presence of deep fades, in which case the entire packet is erased. Erased packets are corrected by the RS code. We also discuss the effect of overall code rate on the net performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","pdfPath":"/iel5/4119225/4119226/04119271.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","doi":"10.1109/ITW2.2006.323773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW2.2006.323773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4119226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Concatenated Reed-Solomon Coding with Hard-decision to Soft-decision LDPC Coding for the Rayleigh Fading Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Reed-Solomon codes","Parity check codes","Fading","Decoding","Error correction codes","Error correction","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Turbo codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4119271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Concatenated Reed-Solomon Coding with Hard-decision to Soft-decision LDPC Coding for the Rayleigh Fading Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4119271/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Concatenated Reed-Solomon Coding with Hard-decision to Soft-decision LDPC Coding for the Rayleigh Fading Channel","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ITW2-00-45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064517S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4119225","isNumber":"4119226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4119225","xplore-issue":"4119226","articleId":"4119271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4119272,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293557500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0067-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0068-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4119272","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119272","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Software algorithms","Iterative algorithms","HDTV","Iterative decoding","Sum product algorithm","Digital video broadcasting","Wiring","Minimization","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","decoding","single-scan min-sum algorithms for"]}],"abstract":"Many implementations for decoding LDPC codes are based on the (normalized/offset) min-sum algorithm due to its satisfactory performance and simplicity in operations. Usually, each iteration of the min-sum algorithm contains two scans, the horizontal scan and the vertical scan.

It can also reduce memory usage or wiring because it only needs the addressing from check nodes to variable nodes while the original min-sum algorithm requires that addressing plus the addressing from variable nodes to check nodes. To cut down memory usage or wiring further, another version of the single-scan min-sum algorithm is presented where the messages of the algorithm are represented by single bit values instead of using fixed point ones.

This paper offers an alternative approach to understand the normalized min-sum algorithm.

Rather than a blessing, this attribute is treated as an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE 802.11). Physical-layer network coding (PNC), however, has been proposed to take advantage of this attribute. Unlike \"conventional\" network coding which performs arithmetic coding on digital bit streams after they are decoded, PNC makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves and applies the network coding arithmetic at the physical layer. As a result, the destructive effect of interference is eliminated and the capacity of networks is boosted significantly. A key requirement of PNC is synchronization among nodes, which has not been addressed previously. This is the focus of this paper. Specifically, we investigate the impact of imperfect synchronization (i.e., finite synchronization errors) on PNC. We show that with BPSK modulation, PNC still yields significantly higher capacity than straightforward network coding when there are synchronization errors.

It can achieve very nearly outage capacity with the optimal selection method while keeping low computational complexity. Besides, the bit error rate (BER) performance under space-time block coding (STBC) transmit scheme demonstrates the significant performance of the proposed selection algorithm","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Antenna Subset Selection for MIMO Wireless Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","doi":"10.1109/ITW2.2006.323848","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","pdfPath":"/iel5/4119225/4119226/04119346.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW2.2006.323848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4119226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119346","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4119346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Fast Antenna Subset Selection for MIMO Wireless Systems","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4119346/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9485118","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Antenna Subset Selection for MIMO Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ITW2-00-120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074453S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4119225","isNumber":"4119226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4119225","xplore-issue":"4119226","articleId":"4119346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4119352,"authors":[{"name":"Liu An","affiliation":["School of EECS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"An","id":"37288109400"},{"name":"Luo Wu","affiliation":["School of EECS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Luo","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290618400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0067-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0068-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4119352","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Parity check codes","Spread spectrum communication","Filters","Sampling methods","Correlators","Phase estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","iterative decoding","matched filters","maximum likelihood estimation","parity check codes","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient iterative synchronization scheme","LDPC-coded DS-SS systems","iterative timing scheme","carrier phase recovery scheme","LDPC-coded direct sequence spread spectrum systems","chip-matched filter","decoding iteration","maximum likelihood theory","AWGN channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an efficient iterative timing and carrier phase recovery scheme is proposed for LDPC-coded direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) systems.

In the latter, multiple base stations serving different cells are grouped to form distributed antenna systems that can be exploited as large MIMO systems. For example, concepts such as joint detection in the uplink and joint transmission in the downlink can be applied in order to cancel or suppress inter-cell interference. In this paper, we focus on the uplink and introduce a framework to investigate capacity bounds in cellular networks that use conventional single-cell links or employ multi-cell joint detection. We observe both an ideal hexagonal cell setup and also the existing GSM cell setup in downtown Dresden, while initially computing the capacities based on idealistic assumptions, and then successively introducing more and more non-idealistic aspects, to finally obtain a good estimate of performance bounds in a real-world system.

By applying the DSW, we show that the near-capacity performance can be approached with a significantly reduced complexity","doi":"10.1109/ITW2.2006.323702","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop - ITW '06 Chengdu","pdfPath":"/iel5/4119225/4119226/04119366.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW2.2006.323702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4119226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection Switching in an Iterative Receiver for MIMO-BICM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119366","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4119366/","displayDocTitle":"Detection Switching in an Iterative Receiver for MIMO-BICM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9485133","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4119366/","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection Switching in an Iterative Receiver for MIMO-BICM systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ITW2-00-140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072101S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4119225","isNumber":"4119226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4119225","xplore-issue":"4119226","articleId":"4119366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4119367,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37292398300"},{"name":"Xudong Guo","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37292757900"},{"name":"Xinmei Wang","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xinmei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281379300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0067-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0068-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4119367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian approximation","Detectors","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Iterative decoding","Random variables","Signal processing","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","interleaved codes","modulation coding","radio receivers","signal detection","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified Gaussian approximation detector","space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation schemes","receiver complexity","turbo-type iterative receiver structure","a posteriori probability decoder","central limited theorem","Gaussian random variable","log-likelihood ratio","optimal detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119367","abstract":"To reduce the receiver complexity of space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation (ST-BICM) schemes, this paper describes a turbo-type iterative receiver structure consisting of a modified Gaussian approximation detector (MGA) and an a posteriori probability (APP) decoder.

However, for mobile applications, channel time-variations in one OFDM symbol introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) which degrades the performance.

Therefore, the performance of coherent OFDM systems greatly depends on the ability to accurately estimate the effective dynamic channel. In this paper, we analyze the ICI in OFDM systems when it operates over time-varying dispersion channels, and build an auto-regressive (AR) model of the channel dynamics based on the Jakes' model.

This paper investigates the causes of impedance mismatches and their effects on the group delay of a wideband signal propagating through a system containing transmission lines between various subassemblies. Due to practical limitations, all subassemblies present non-ideal input and output impedance matches to the transmission lines connecting them together. Therefore, this produces the case of two impedance mismatches separated by a length of transmission line. This, in turn, causes sinusoidal group delay (as well as amplitude) variations to occur. There can also be multiple mismatches between a transmission line source and load due to components such as switches, power splitters, directional couplers, etc., inserted between the source and load. The periodic frequency of these sinusoidal group delay variations as well as their peak-to-valley amplitudes depend on the absolute magnitude of the reflection coefficients of the impedance mismatches, the electrical length of the transmission line between them, and the transmission loss of the transmission line. The group delay variations can cause significant signal distortion even with normally assumed sufficient values of voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) at the input and output ports of the subassemblies. This paper presents various methods to predict the values of these group delay variations. In addition, practical compensation methods to reduce or eliminate the group delay variations are given.","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.1987.323870","publicationTitle":"29th ARFTG Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"29th ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4119407/4119408/04119428.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.1987.323870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4119408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Delay Caused by Impedance Mismatch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 June 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4119428/","displayDocTitle":"Group Delay Caused by Impedance Mismatch","volume":"11","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","conferenceDate":"12-13 June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Delay Caused by Impedance Mismatch","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-11-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027624S","chronDate":"12-13 June 1987","isNumber":"4119408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4119407","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4119428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4119463,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper describes a DSP-based RF test technique which extracts the gain compression and phase distortion characteristics of an amplifier from measurements performed with a digitally-modulated test stimulus. The technique utilizes the magnitude variations inherent in phase-shift keyed (PSK) modulation to sweep the input power to an amplifier, instead of using a power sweep from a network analyzer. By downconverting the modulated signal and digitizing in the time domain, the magnitude and phase of the modulation may be measured at the input and output of the amplifier. Using the modulation instead of a cw power sweep to drive the amplifier into compression might produce better correlation between test results and actual operation, at least for PSK modulation schemes. We have demonstrated this new technique experimentally on a commercial power amplifier, where we compare network analyzer power sweep data to DSP-based results using BPSK signals at two different bit rates. For this amplifier at 1 kbps the DSP-based measurement of saturation agrees with the network analyzer measurement and demonstrates the validity of the new technique. At 100 kbps, the amplifier saturation behavior during BPSK operation differs from that measured on the network analyzer in two repects: the nonlinearity of the amplifier decreases at the higher bit rate, and the saturation shows significant time-domain hysteresis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["RF signals","Distortion measurement","Frequency measurement","Gain measurement","Phase measurement","Phase distortion","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Digital modulation","Testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.1995.327133","publicationTitle":"46th ARFTG Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"46th ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4119802/4119803/04119811.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4119803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.1995.327133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Digitally-Modulated Signals to Measure the Gain Compression and Phase Distortion of a Radio Frequency Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using Digitally-Modulated Signals to Measure the Gain Compression and Phase Distortion of a Radio Frequency Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4119811/","isConference":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-1 Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 1995-Dec. 1 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Digitally-Modulated Signals to Measure the Gain Compression and Phase Distortion of a Radio Frequency Amplifier","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-28-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030057S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 1995-Dec. 1 1995","isNumber":"4119803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4119802","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4119811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4119812,"authors":[{"name":"John F.

To overcome these constraints, we present an integral strategy for spread spectrum simulation and test, which will be illustrated using the North American Digital Cellular, IS-95 standard. Taking advantage of HP-EEsof's Circuit Envelope Simulator developed for the simulation of RF circuits driven by complex signals, we have implemented the complete IS-95 standard in their Microwave Design System (MDS). This facilitates simulation and test at the hardware and software level using physical CDMA signals as defined in the simulator and generated externally. CDMA design examples are introduced and considered in some depth. This method can be extended for testing a wide variety of circuits intended for use in other communication systems such as W-CDMA, GSM and DECT.","displayPublicationTitle":"51st ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4119958/4119959/04119964.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"51st ARFTG Conference Digest","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.1998.327275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.1998.327275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4119959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4119964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and Verification of CDMA Power Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Power amplifiers","Circuit simulation","Circuit testing","Spread spectrum communication","Microwave circuits","Radio frequency","RF signals","Standards development","Signal design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile communication","CDMA","Verification","Virtual loop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4119964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1998","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and Verification of CDMA Power Amplifiers","isConference":true,"volume":"33","publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and Verification of CDMA Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-33-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027999S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1998","isNumber":"4119959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4119958","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4119964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
