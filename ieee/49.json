The as-deposited Ni-Fe/Fe-Mn and NiO/Ni-Fe films exhibit strong exchange coupling, while the Ni-Fe/Ni-Mn films require annealing to enhance exchange coupling. Both H/sub UA/ and H/sub CE/ follow an inverse dependence of the Ni-Fe film thickness in all cases, as expected from the interface nature of exchange coupling. The Fe-Mn film thickness required for the onset of exchange coupling is much smaller than the Ni-Mn and NiO film thicknesses. The thermal stability of the Ni-Fe/Ni-Mn films is superior to that of the Ni-Fe/Fe-Mn and NiO/Ni-Fe films. To explain annealing effects on exchange coupling in the Ni-Fe/Ni-Mn films, we propose an exchange-coupling model consistent with models applied to the Ni-Fe/Fe-Mn and NiO/Ni-Fe films in previous studies. Uniform-field tests of the MR sensors longitudinally biased by the three types of exchange-coupled films show quiet and stable MR responses in all cases. We evaluate the exchange-coupled films based on desired properties for the sensor stabilization, and then discuss their merits and deficiencies.","doi":"10.1109/20.490063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/10520/00490063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.490063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10520","startPage":"2585","endPage":"2590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exchange-coupled Ni-Fe/Fe-Mn, Ni-Fe/Ni-Mn and NiO/Ni-Fe films for stabilization of magnetoresistive sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exchange-coupled Ni-Fe/Fe-Mn, Ni-Fe/Ni-Mn and NiO/Ni-Fe films for stabilization of magnetoresistive sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5121880","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exchange-coupled Ni-Fe/Fe-Mn, Ni-Fe/Ni-Mn and NiO/Ni-Fe films for stabilization of magnetoresistive sensors","sourcePdf":"00490063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050913S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","articleId":"490063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":490072,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Conclusions are drawn with regard to the adequacy of the wide sense uncorrelated scattering model as a consistent model for the indoor radio channel.","doi":"10.1109/49.490225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10455/00490225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10455","startPage":"405","endPage":"410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analysis of measured impulse response functions of 2.0 GHz indoor radio channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis of measured impulse response functions of 2.0 GHz indoor radio channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251295","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis of measured impulse response functions of 2.0 GHz indoor radio channels","sourcePdf":"00490225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045116S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"48","articleId":"490225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":490226,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

Three linear signal combining techniques are considered: signal selection (SEL), maximal ratio combining (MRC), and equal gain combining (EGC). The computations of received fading envelopes are performed by means of an analytical model, based on a three-dimensional ray-tracing (RT)/uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) technique; the reliability of the adopted approach is confirmed by comparison with some test measurements. The electromagnetic field components are adequately processed to obtain the single branch and combined signal envelope. The results show the very significant benefits that can be achieved both in terms of diversity gain and diversity advantage for both diversity techniques.

Unfortunately, the coverage region for a transceiver depends heavily on the type of building and on the placement of walls within the building. Traditionally, therefore, transceiver locations have been selected by human experts who rely on experience and heuristics to obtain the optimum (or near-optimum) placement. This paper describes an interactive software system that can be used to assist in transceiver placement. It is intended to be easy to use by individuals who are not experts at wireless communication system design. After the user has selected transceiver locations within a graphical floor plan, the system interprets the floor plan and uses simple path loss models to estimate coverage regions for each transceiver. These regions are highlighted, enabling the user to assess the total coverage. This paper describes the methodology used to compute the coverage regions for multifloored buildings and discusses the effect of interference sources. The resulting system is expected to be useful in the specification of indoor wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/49.490227","startPage":"420","endPage":"430","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10455/00490227.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive computation of coverage regions for wireless communication in multifloored indoor environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Transceivers","Radio frequency","Floors","Buildings","Telephony","Indoor environments","Wireless LAN","Cost function","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","transceivers","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","building","telecommunication computing","software tools","radiowave propagation","data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive computation","coverage regions","multifloored indoor environments","indoor wireless communication systems","radio frequency transceivers","RF transceivers","optimum communication coverage","walls","transceiver locations","interactive software system","transceiver placement","graphical floor plan","path loss models","total coverage","interference sources","visualisation tool"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490227/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Interactive computation of coverage regions for wireless communication in multifloored indoor environments","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5251297","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive computation of coverage regions for wireless communication in multifloored indoor environments","sourcePdf":"00490227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048663S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"55","articleId":"490227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":490228,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is intended to help in establishing design guidelines for indoor wireless communications systems using millimeter waves. It deals with measurements obtained for the narrow and wideband indoor radio channels at 37.2 GHz within a typical concrete building at Laval University. Two kinds of transmission antennas, omnidirectional and directional, are used to investigate the propagation characteristics for the indoor channel. Under line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, the distance-power law exponent is found to be lower than the free space condition with walls playing a major role on the sustaining of high level signals. Large- and smallscale variations extracted from the original data are shown to follow log-normal and Rice distributions, respectively. The observed wideband impulse response has delay spread extending over a range up to 40 ns and a maximum root mean square (rms) value of about 16 ns. Both amplitude and phase behaviors of the signals are available for a better understanding of the various effects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10455/00490228.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.490228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental characterization of EHF multipath indoor radio channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indoor radio communication","Wideband","Frequency","Multipath channels","Guidelines","Wireless communication","Millimeter wave measurements","Millimeter wave propagation","Antenna measurements","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave antennas","millimetre wave propagation","multipath channels","indoor radio","millimetre wave measurement","directive antennas","log normal distribution","delays","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["characterization","multipath channel","design guidelines","indoor wireless communications systems","millimeter waves","wideband indoor radio channel","narrowband indoor radio channel","concrete building","transmission antennas","directional antennas","omnidirectional antennas","propagation characteristics","line-of-sight conditions","distance-power law exponent","free space condition","Rice distribution","log-normal distribution","wideband impulse response","delay spread","maximum root mean square value","EHF","37.2 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Experimental characterization of EHF multipath indoor radio channels","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental characterization of EHF multipath indoor radio channels","sourcePdf":"00490228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050147S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"36","articleId":"490228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":490229,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The work reported in this paper investigated the effects of the radiation patterns of the antennas at remote terminals on multipath propagation characteristics. These effects were investigated by indoor propagation measurements at 60 GHz conducted in a modern office room and by ray-tracing simulations based on geometrical optics. Multipath channel characteristics are compared in terms of impulse responses and their root-mean-square (rms) delay spreads for an omnidirectional antenna and for three directive antennas with different beam widths. From the results of measurements and ray-tracing simulations, the use of a directive antenna at the remote terminal is demonstrated to be an effective method of reducing the effects of multipath propagation. Further reduction in the multipath effects is found to be achieved by the use of circular polarization instead of linear polarization with the directive antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","volume":"14","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5251299","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of antenna directivity and polarization on indoor multipath propagation characteristics at 60 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of antenna directivity and polarization on indoor multipath propagation characteristics at 60 GHz","sourcePdf":"00490229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069126S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"166","articleId":"490229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":490232,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The performance of a correlation receiver has been evaluated for a multipath channel and in the presence of an additional multiple access interference. We analyze the problem of decision feedback equalization (DFE) for such a system. In order to understand the potential of the system with equalization, we first study the steady-state behavior of the equalizer for a minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. The investigation is carried out for a receiver made of a bank of filters matched to both the symbol shape and the channel, and for a two path channel. Assuming transmission of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) symbols, an exact expression of the bit error probability is obtained in the form of an integral. Then adaptive least mean square (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) structures are derived. The performance of the adaptive RLS algorithm is demonstrated by means of computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/49.490235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490235","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10455/00490235.pdf","startPage":"502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO DFE equalization for multitone DS/SS systems over multipath channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490235/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO DFE equalization for multitone DS/SS systems over multipath channels","volume":"14","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5251305","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO DFE equalization for multitone DS/SS systems over multipath channels","sourcePdf":"00490235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039101S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","articleId":"490235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":490236,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This equalization scheme is appropriate whenever conventional equalizers are not capable of tracking phase variations in selective fading channels. The received signal is first converted to a baseband signal and then sent through a differential detector. A nonlinear processor before the equalizer generates the needed nonlinear terms that are weighted and summed in the equalizer. Nonlinear intersymbol interference at the output of the differential detector is dealt with by minimizing an error signal between the output of the equalizer and the detected data.

However, the decoding of turbo-codes relies on the application of soft input/soft output decoders. Such decoders can be realized either using maximum a posteriori (MAP) symbol estimators or MAP sequence estimators, e.g., the a priori soft output Viterbi algorithm (APRI-SOVA). In this paper, the structure of turbo-code encoders as well as of turbo-code decoders is described. In particular, four different decoder structures are illustratively characterized and their error rate performance capabilities compared in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as flat Rayleigh-fading channels based on extensive simulation results for short frames used for speech transmission in the uplink of a digital mobile radio system applying code division multiple access and joint detection. The decoders are investigated as follows: 1) the MAP symbol estimator-based approach used by Berrou et al.

Intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) is employed, which results in equivalent baseband channels with a nonnegativity constraint on the input. The power efficiencies of modulation schemes are compared at 30 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s over an ensemble of experimentally determined multipath channels. Carrier selection and power shaping are examined as methods for improving MSM performance. It is found that MSM schemes can allow operation at higher data rates than single-carrier modulation schemes without equalization. Moreover, MSM schemes can be more bandwidth-efficient and also can provide a simple and flexible method for multiple access to the channel. However, they are not as power efficient as single-carrier schemes, and this will limit their use to applications which are not power limited.","doi":"10.1109/49.490239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10455/00490239.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-subcarrier modulation for nondirected wireless infrared communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-subcarrier modulation for nondirected wireless infrared communication","volume":"14","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251309","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490239/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-subcarrier modulation for nondirected wireless infrared communication","sourcePdf":"00490239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03663S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"220","articleId":"490239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":490240,"authors":[{"name":"Mo-Han Fong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Mo-Han Fong","id":"37301748100"},{"name":"V.K.

The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of user capacity. In order to incorporate traffic with a wide range of source rates, line rates (adjusted data rates before spreading) have to be selected for transmission. For traffic with source rates higher than the line rate of concern, we propose the use of concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences to subdivide a high rate stream into parallel line rate streams. Therefore, in this paper, we first analyze the properties of the concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences. The results are used to evaluate their performance for homogenous voice traffic in various cellular mobile environments with multipath fading, lognormal shadowing, and path loss. Our results show that the proposed spreading scheme offers a significant improvement in the forward link capacity as compared to using the conventional nonconcatenated long PN sequence, especially if the multipath fading is Rician (e.g., microcellular and indoor picocellular systems). Incorporating the notion of line rate, we then evaluate the performance of a system with integrated voice and video traffic. Special emphasis is placed on the effect of line rate selection on the overall capacity which leads to the optimal selection of line rates.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00490240.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10455/00490240.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.490240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences and their application to cellular DS-CDMA systems with integrated traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Multiaccess communication","Telecommunication traffic","Fading","Delay effects","Shadow mapping","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","Rician channels","Facsimile"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","cellular radio","telecommunication traffic","multipath channels","fading","voice communication","visual communication","data communication","channel capacity","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences","cellular DS-CDMA systems","integrated traffic","direct sequence code-division multiple access","performance","user capacity","source rate","line rates","parallel line rate stream","homogenous voice traffic","multipath fading","lognormal shadowing","path loss","forward link capacity","Rician channel","video traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences and their application to cellular DS-CDMA systems with integrated traffic","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251310","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences and their application to cellular DS-CDMA systems with integrated traffic","sourcePdf":"00490240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062464S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"55","articleId":"490240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":490257,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Che","affiliation":["Quantum Corporation, Advanced Recording Technology, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Che","id":"37358252300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"490257","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":74,"totalDownloads":107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Testing","Distortion measurement","Magnetic heads","Frequency domain analysis","Analytical models","Magnetostatic waves","Measurement techniques","Optimization methods","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial response channels","maximum likelihood detection","magnetic recording","frequency-domain analysis","magnetic disc storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinearity measurements","write precompensation studies","PRML recording channel","nonlinear transition shift","partial erasure","frequency domain method","write current optimization","semi-contact recording","MR playback","correlation factor","optimal write precompensation level","spinstand experiments","disk drives"]}],"abstract":"A general overview of nonlinearity measurement techniques is presented.

Based on spin-stand measurements, noise spatial correlations of dibit transitions at small bit intervals is characterized as two statistically independent correlation modes: the coherent amplitude fluctuation of the dipulse and shift-in-unison of the entire dipulse waveform. In the density region where supralinear noise enhancement is relatively pronounced, the amplitude fluctuation mode dominates the noise spatial correlation. It is found that the correlated medium noise can degrade the performance of a (0, k) coded PR4-ML channel by 5-6 dB over white Gaussian noise. However, (1, k) coded EPR4 and EEPR4 channels are much more immune to the coherent amplitude fluctuation mode noise. It is concluded that in the supralinear noise region, (1, k) coded EPR4 and EEPR4 channels could have much improved performance over (0, k) coded PR4 channel in the medium noise dominated environment.","doi":"10.1109/20.490278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/10520/00490278.pdf","startPage":"3087","endPage":"3089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.490278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of medium noise correlation on various partial response channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490278/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of medium noise correlation on various partial response channels","volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5128286","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of medium noise correlation on various partial response channels","sourcePdf":"00490278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044771S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","articleId":"490278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":490290,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The algorithms operate within a self-referencing matched filter synchronizer structure, and are particularly useful in reducing synchronization overhead on links designed to carry packet-type services. The main distinguishing characteristic between the two schemes is that one uses hard-decision while the other uses soft-decision detection. The proposed schemes are especially applicable to reverse link transmissions in quasisynchronous CDMA systems in which timing at portable terminals is established via pilot and synchronization signals received on respective code-division channels from the home base. If discontinuous (bursty) transmission is used on reverse links, the acquisition process is required for each transmission burst because of the propagation time uncertainty. Analysis of the algorithms on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels reveals that their performance depends significantly on the choice of synchronizer parameters and the average despread signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). When this choice is proper, acquisition over a single preamble of relatively short duration can be achieved with high probability. The soft-decision scheme introduces a performance advantage of between 4-9 dB depending on the length of the synchronizing preamble.","doi":"10.1109/49.490291","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"570","endPage":"579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10455/00490291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid acquisition algorithms for synchronization of bursty transmissions in CDMA microcellular and personal wireless systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Algorithm design and analysis","AWGN","Spread spectrum communication","Matched filters","Timing","Uncertainty","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Gaussian channels","Rayleigh channels","fading","synchronisation","personal communication networks","cellular radio","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","matched filters","packet radio networks","signal detection","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid acquisition algorithms","synchronization","bursty transmissions","CDMA","microcellular wireless systems","personal wireless systems","spread spectrum links","code division multiple access","self-referencing matched filter synchronizer structure","packet-type services","hard-decision scheme","soft-decision detection","reverse link transmissions","quasisynchronous CDMA systems","code-division channels","additive white Gaussian noise","Rayleigh fading channels","despread signal-to-interference ratio","soft-decision scheme","4 to 9 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Rapid acquisition algorithms for synchronization of bursty transmissions in CDMA microcellular and personal wireless systems","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5251312","publicationDate":"April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490291/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid acquisition algorithms for synchronization of bursty transmissions in CDMA microcellular and personal wireless systems","sourcePdf":"00490291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050906S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","articleId":"490291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":490292,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It addresses the three main issues of radio access, namely the channel reuse, the multiple access, and the handover problems, in complete adherence to packet-switching principles. The CDPA channel reuse mechanism is a completely new alternative with respect to time-division, frequency-division, or code-division multiple-access (TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA, respectively), which achieve communication parallelism by subdividing the bandwidth a priori among cells. In CDPA, a single frequency channel is used and parallel transmissions are achieved through the \"capture\" capability of receivers. The hybrid reservation-polling multiple access mechanism used in CDPA is able to integrate any kind of traffic and guarantees almost immediate retransmission of packets that are not captured, thus assuring their correct reception. Finally, the packet-switching approach allows connectionless communications with any base station (BS), and eliminates the need for extra radio traffic in managing handovers. This turns out to be very effective in local area systems where the required high bandwidth is obtained by using a pico-cell structure. We present the CDPA architecture, discuss some implementation issues, and evaluate its performance under a variety of system parameters and operating conditions, using analytical and simulation methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10456/00490412.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.490412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10456","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capture-division packet access for wireless personal communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Frequency","GSM","Interference","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Land mobile radio","Narrowband","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal communication networks","cellular radio","packet reservation multiple access","packet switching","frequency allocation","subscriber loops","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capture division packet access","wireless personal communications","third generation mobile systems","cellular systems","radio access","channel reuse","system parameters","handover problems","packet switching","picocell structure","performance evaluation","communication parallelism","bandwidth","single frequency channel","parallel transmissions","receivers","hybrid reservation-polling multiple access","traffic integration","packet retransmission","connectionless communications","base station","simulation","analytical methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Capture-division packet access for wireless personal communications","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5270330","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capture-division packet access for wireless personal communications","sourcePdf":"00490412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061488S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"51","articleId":"490412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":490414,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Low-power PCS systems require a dense grid of radio ports to provide connectivity to the telephone network. Analog transport has a number of important advantages over digital transmission facilities, including the flexibility to support a variety of air interface formats, shared infrastructure cost with other services such as video distribution, and centralized call processing allowing the use of low cost and simple radio ports. A simulcast technique can be used in such systems to permit low rates of handoff (no handoff within each simulcast area) and sharing of hardware resources among multiple radio ports. This paper provides a detailed model and a simulation analysis of the cochannel interference and noise performance as well as the resource sharing benefit of a simulcast PCS system. Several potential PCS air interfaces are considered, including time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques. Our investigation shows that the impact of multiple antenna noise in a simulcast system is offset by the improved signal-to-interference (SIR) ratio brought about by distributed antennas. Even with distributed antennas, multiple antenna noise places a limit on the maximum number of radio ports that can be assigned to each simulcast group. This limit, however, is shown to have little impact on the achievable resource sharing benefit of simulcasting (i.e., grouping beyond this limit has diminishing returns). A saving of 40% to 60%, in terms of the required central hardware resources, is typical for both TDMA and CDMA systems in suburban environments.","doi":"10.1109/49.490414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10456/00490414.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10456","startPage":"632","endPage":"643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of simulcast wireless techniques for personal communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of simulcast wireless techniques for personal communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5270332","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of simulcast wireless techniques for personal communication systems","sourcePdf":"00490414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06637S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"45","articleId":"490414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":490415,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

The CDMA PCS distributed antenna system was set up with three nodes, each having two time-delayed elements, in a Qualcomm two story office building in San Diego. This paper presents measurement and modeling results on coverage, voice quality (frame error rate), reduction of transmit power, and path diversity for the in-building CDMA PCS distributed antenna system. Wideband CDMA signal coverage was predicted by using a ray tracing tool to find optimum placement of the distributed antennas. Using three nodes mounted in the ceiling space between the first and second floors, with each active element transmitting at -5 dBm in the system, the ray-tracing prediction shows good signal coverage in both floors of the building. The prediction results are confirmed by measurements at numerous discrete points with a standard deviation of 3.3 dB. Measurements using various combinations of number of nodes and delay elements showed significant time and path diversity advantages for the CDMA-distributed antenna system in indoor radio environments. Trade-offs between diversity gain and self-interference due to uncaptured finger energy in fringe areas are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CDMA-distributed antenna system for in-building personal communications services","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.490415","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10456/00490415.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10456","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"A CDMA-distributed antenna system for in-building personal communications services","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5270333","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CDMA-distributed antenna system for in-building personal communications services","sourcePdf":"00490415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031337S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"28","articleId":"490415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-18"},{"_id":490417,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

For those combining schemes, a reduction in complexity is achieved by limiting the number of combined signals to small values and by increasing the number of received signals. Bit error rate (BER) performance of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) with predetection combining of selected signals (CSS) and BER performance of differential BPSK with postdetection CSS are analyzed for slow fading and Rayleigh-distributed envelope statistics. Predetection maximal ratio combining of signals that comes from a single group or several groups of diversity channels as well as postdetection combining of received signals for groups of channels are considered. In comparing predetection combining with groups (PCG) and predetection combining of the best signals (PCB), we observe that the required SNR for achieving a certain BER is approximatively the same (with PCG having a slight advantage of 0.5 dB) for a given number, N, of diversity channels and L combined signals. Furthermore. PCG is equivalent to PCB for L=N since both techniques then correspond to conventional predetection maximal ratio combining (MRC), PCG and PCB are also equivalent when L=1 as both schemes then correspond to conventional selection combining. A small degradation of approximately 2 dB in the required SNR is observed when postdetection diversity reception with groups (PDG) is used instead of PCG. For L=N, PDG reduces to post detection MRC. The PDG technique is considered more suitable than PCB or PCG for MM-indoor wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/49.490418","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10456/00490418.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.490418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"674","endPage":"682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection diversity combining with multiple antennas for MM-wave indoor wireless channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Selection diversity combining with multiple antennas for MM-wave indoor wireless channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490418/","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5270336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection diversity combining with multiple antennas for MM-wave indoor wireless channels","sourcePdf":"00490418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033979S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"43","articleId":"490418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":490419,"authors":[{"name":"Jianming Wu","affiliation":["Electric and Computer Engineering Division Faculty of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Jianming Wu","id":"37350156600"},{"name":"R.

Handoff dropping or cell overload are consequences of congestion in wireless networks. Our call admission control algorithm takes into consideration the number of calls in adjacent cells, in addition to the number of calls in the cell where a new call request is made, in order to make a call admission decision. This is done by every base station in a distributed manner without the involvement of the network call processor. The admission condition is simple enough that the admission decision can be made in real time. Furthermore, we show that our distributed call admission control scheme limits the handoff dropping or the cell overload probability to a predefined level almost independent of load conditions.

Notwithstanding the many examples of such sectionalizations for particular codes that appeared in the literature, no systematic method for finding the best sectionalization of a given trellis is presently known. We present a polynomial-time algorithm which produces the optimal sectionalization of a given trellis T in time O(n/sup 2/), where n is the length of the code generated by T. The algorithm is developed in a general setting of certain operations and functions defined on the set of trellises; it therefore applies to both linear and nonlinear codes, and easily accommodates a broad range of optimality criteria. The particular optimality criterion based on minimizing the total number of additions and comparisons required for maximum-likelihood trellis decoding is investigated in detail: several different methods for decoding a given trellis are discussed and compared in a number of examples.

Some portions of this new decoding algorithm operate on symbols of length lgq bits; other portions operate on somewhat longer symbols. In the worst case, the total number of calculations required by the new decoding algorithm is proportional to nr, where n is the code's block length and r is its redundancy. This worst case workload is very similar to prior algorithms. But in many applications, average-case workload and error-correcting performance are both much better. The input to the new algorithm consists of n received symbols from GF(q), and n nonnegative real numbers, each of which is the reliability of the corresponding received symbol. Any conceivable errata pattern has a \"score\" equal to the sum of the reliabilities of its locations with nonzero errata values. A max-likelihood decoder would find the minimum score over all possible errata patterns. Our new decoding algorithm finds the minimum score only over a subset of these possible errata patterns. The errata within any candidate errata pattern may be partitioned into \"errors\" and \"erasures,\" depending on whether the corresponding reliabilities are above or below an \"erasure threshold.\" Different candidate errata patterns may have different thresholds, each chosen to minimize its corresponding ERRATA COUNT, which is defined as 2/spl middot/(number of errors)+(number of erasures). The new algorithm finds an errata pattern with minimum score among all errata patterns for which ERRATA COUNT/spl les/r+1 where r is the redundancy of the RS code. Conventional algorithms also require that the erasure threshold be set a priori; the new algorithm obtains the best answer over all possible settings of the erasure threshold. Conventional cyclic RS codes have length n=q-1, and their locations correspond to the nonzero elements of GF(q). The new algorithm also applies very naturally to RS codes which have been doubly extended by the inclusion of 0 and /spl infin/ as additional locations.","doi":"10.1109/18.490539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.490539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/10454/00490539.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounded distance+1 soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Bounded distance+1 soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","volume":"42","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5270970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded distance+1 soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","sourcePdf":"00490539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106249S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"66","articleId":"490539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":490540,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Based either on probabilistic properties or on the structure of the code considered, three improvements to the algorithm devised by Fossorier and Lin (see ibid., vol.41, no.9, p.1379-1396, 1995) are presented. These modifications allow large computation savings or significant decoding speedup with little error performance degradation. First, a reduced probabilistic list of codeword candidates is associated with order-i reprocessing of a given code. It results in a large reduction of the maximum number of computations with a very small degradation in performance. Then, a probabilistic stopping criterion is introduced for order-0 reprocessing. This new test significantly decreases the average number of computations when appropriately implemented. Finally, the application of the algorithm to coset decoding is considered for |u|u+v| constructed codes. In addition to the conventional coset decoding, a new adaptive practically optimum coset decoding method is presented where at each reprocessing stage, the number of surviving cosets decreases. Suboptimum closest coset decoding is also investigated. It is shown that two-stage decoding with the algorithm of Fossorier and Lin offers a large variety of choices, since the reprocessing order of each stage can be determined independently.","doi":"10.1109/18.490541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.490541","startPage":"738","endPage":"750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/10454/00490541.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient soft-decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient soft-decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5270972","publicationDate":"May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient soft-decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","sourcePdf":"00490541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028692S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"48","articleId":"490541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":490542,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Trott","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Trott","id":"37274266500"},{"name":"S.

This paper contains new methods to construct efficient balanced codes. To design a balanced code, an information word with a low number of 1's or 0's is compressed and then balanced using the saved space. On the other hand, an information word having almost the same number of 1's and 0's is encoded using the single maps defined by Knuth's (1986) complementation method. Three different constructions are presented. Balanced codes with r check bits and k information bits with k/spl les/2/sup r+1/-2, k/spl les/3/spl times/2/sup r/-8, and k/spl les/5/spl times/2/sup r/-10r+c(r), c(r)/spl isin/{-15, -10, -5, 0, +5}, are given, improving the constructions found in the literature. In some cases, the first two constructions have a parallel coding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/18.490545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/10454/00490545.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.490545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of some new efficient balanced codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490545/","displayDocTitle":"Design of some new efficient balanced codes","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5277051","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of some new efficient balanced codes","sourcePdf":"00490545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047204S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"57","articleId":"490545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":490546,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Zhang","affiliation":["Communication Sciences Institute, Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhen Zhang","id":"37279639300"},{"name":"V.K.

Two versions of the gold-washing data compression algorithm, one with codebook innovation interval and the other with finitely many codebook innovations, are considered. The version of the gold-washing algorithm with codebook innovation interval k is a variant of the gold-washing algorithm such that the codebook is innovated once every k+1 source words during the process of encoding the entire source. It is demonstrated that when this version of the gold-washing algorithm is applied to encode a stationary, /spl phi/-mixing source, the expected distortion performance converges to the distortion rate function of the source as the codebook length goes to infinity. Furthermore, if the source to be encoded is a Markov source or a finite-state source, then the corresponding sample distortion performance converges almost surely to the distortion rate function. The version of the gold-washing algorithm with finitely many codebook innovations is a variant of the gold-washing algorithm in which after finitely many codebook innovations, the codebook is held fixed and reused to encode the forthcoming source sequence block by block. Similar results are shown for this version of the gold-washing algorithm.

These channels have memory due to the Markov channel variation. We obtain the FSMC capacity as a function of the conditional channel state probability. We also show that for i.i.d. channel inputs, this conditional probability converges weakly, and the channel's mutual information is then a closed-form continuous function of the input distribution. We next consider coding for FSMCs. In general, the complexity of maximum-likelihood decoding grows exponentially with the channel memory length. Therefore, in practice, interleaving and memoryless channel codes are used. This technique results in some performance loss relative to the inherent capacity of channels with memory. We propose a maximum-likelihood decision-feedback decoder with complexity that is independent of the channel memory. We calculate the capacity and cutoff rate of our technique, and show that it preserves the capacity of certain FSMCs. We also compare the performance of the decision-feedback decoder with that of interleaving and memoryless channel coding on a fading channel with 4PSK modulation.","doi":"10.1109/18.490551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/10454/00490551.pdf","startPage":"868","endPage":"886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.490551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity, mutual information, and coding for finite-state Markov channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Capacity, mutual information, and coding for finite-state Markov channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490551/","publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5270980","volume":"42","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity, mutual information, and coding for finite-state Markov channels","sourcePdf":"00490551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074328S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"211","articleId":"490551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":490552,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The CEO deploys a team of L agents who observe independently corrupted versions of {X(t)}/sub t=1//sup /spl infin//. Because {X(t)} is only one among many pressing matters to which the CEO must attend, the combined data rate at which the agents may communicate information about their observations to the CEO is limited to, say, R bits per second. If the agents were permitted to confer and pool their data, then in the limit as L/spl rarr//spl infin/ they usually would be able to smooth out their independent observation noises entirely. Then they could use their R bits per second to provide the CEO with a representation of {X(t)} with fidelity D(R), where D(/spl middot/) is the distortion-rate function of {X(t)}. In particular, with such data pooling D can be made arbitrarily small if R exceeds the entropy rate H of {X(t)}. Suppose, however, that the agents are not permitted to convene, Agent i having to send data based solely on his own noisy observations {Y/sub i/(t)}.

Furthermore, we show that, under the assumed constraint of finite-length filters, the relative delay between the equalizer and the target impulse response plays a crucial role in optimizing performance. We describe a new characterization of the optimum delay and show how to compute it.

If the observations at the different sensors consist of noisy versions of random signals which were produced by the same source, then these observations may not be independent. It is also possible that the noise distribution may not be completely known. Cases where weak random signals are observed in possibly non-Gaussian additive noise are considered. The focus is on cases where the sensor tests are based only on the ranks and signs of the observations. Numerical results are provided which indicate that distributed schemes based on ranks and signs are less sensitive to the exact noise statistics when compared to optimum schemes based directly on the observations. This is especially true for some cases where the actual noise distribution has heavy tails, which can cause the optimum schemes based directly on the observations to perform poorly. Analytical forms are given for the locally optimum sensor test statistics based on the ranks and signs of the observations, and we use these to find the best distributed detection schemes for some cases. In the course of obtaining our results, a general set of necessary conditions is given which provide the analytical forms of the locally optimum distributed sensor tests for cases where the observations are discrete random variables. Conditions of this type have not been given previously.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/10454/00490555.pdf","startPage":"931","endPage":"942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.490555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.490555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally optimum distributed detection of correlated random signals based on ranks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Testing","Sensor fusion","Statistical distributions","Additive noise","Probability distribution","Statistical analysis","Random variables","Robustness","Arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","statistical analysis","random noise","correlation methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locally optimum distributed detection","correlated random signals","statistical model","observation ranks","observation signs","noisy random signals","noise distribution","weak random signals","nonGaussian additive noise","sensor tests","numerical results","optimum detection schemes","locally optimum sensor test statistics","necessary conditions","locally optimum distributed sensor tests","discrete random variables"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Locally optimum distributed detection of correlated random signals based on ranks","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally optimum distributed detection of correlated random signals based on ranks","sourcePdf":"00490555.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035952S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"29","articleId":"490555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":490559,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Existing multicast routing mechanisms were intended for use within regions where a group is widely represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. When group members, and senders to those group members, are distributed sparsely across a wide area, these schemes are not efficient; data packets or membership report information are occasionally sent over many links that do not lead to receivers or senders, respectively. We have developed a multicast routing architecture that efficiently establishes distribution trees across wide area internets, where many groups will be sparsely represented. Efficiency is measured in terms of the router state, control message processing, and data packet processing, required across the entire network in order to deliver data packets to the members of the group. Our protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture: (a) maintains the traditional IP multicast service model of receiver-initiated membership, (b) supports both shared and source-specific (shortest-path) distribution trees, (c) is not dependent on a specific unicast routing protocol, and (d) uses soft-state mechanisms to adapt to underlying network conditions and group dynamics. The robustness, flexibility, and scaling properties of this architecture make it well-suited to large heterogeneous internetworks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/10558/00490743.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.490743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.490743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The PIM architecture for wide-area multicast routing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicast protocols","Routing protocols","Unicast","Internet","Jacobian matrices","Bandwidth","Process control","Computer science","Costs","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide area networks","internetworking","network routing","transport protocols","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide area multicast routing","communication costs reduction","bandwidth","data packets","membership report information","multicast routing architecture","shared distribution trees","wide area internets","efficiency","router state","control message processing","data packet processing","protocol independent multicast architecture","IP multicast service model","receiver initiated membership","shortest path distribution trees","source specific distribution trees","soft-state mechanisms","group dynamics","scaling properties","large heterogeneous internetworks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"The PIM architecture for wide-area multicast routing","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5260964","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The PIM architecture for wide-area multicast routing","sourcePdf":"00490743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096853S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"362","articleId":"490743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":490750,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is based on room-sized pico-cells and mobile multimedia endpoints. It enables users carrying multimedia endpoints, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptops, and portable multimedia terminals, to seamlessly roam while accessing multimedia data resident in a backbone wired network. The network model of SWAN consists of base stations connected by a wired asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) backbone network, and wireless ATM last hops to the mobile hosts. SWAN is one of the first systems to realize the concept of a wireless and mobile ATM network. Mobile hosts as well as base stations are embedded with custom-designed ATM adapter cards called FAWN (Flexible Adapter for Wireless Networking). FAWN uses off-the-shelf 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band radios. After giving an overview of the SWAN network model, and discussing the challenges in making ATM wireless and mobile, the article describes the first phase implementation of SWAN hardware and software.

Another element of the environment with which they deal is that of multihop communications. They focus on two layers of key importance in multimedia wireless network design, namely compression algorithms and adaptivity in the voice/video applications layer, and network algorithms at the wireless subnet layer.

Much progress has been made in understanding the physical mechanisms that cause total-dose-induced failure, and this knowledge has been applied to hardened-technology development. Many of the hardened technologies are no longer available, however, and hence more commercial off-the-shelf components are being used. This situation presents a challenge for system designers, since the commercial parts typically have lower failure levels and larger variability in response. In addition, recent studies have uncovered new challenges for total-dose hardness assurance in the form of 1) an enhanced low dose-rate sensitivity of bipolar linear microcircuits, 2) an effect of burn in on CMOS microcircuit total-dose response, and 3) an enhanced effect of plastic packaging on the burned-in effect for CMOS circuits. These issues are addressed as they relate to the space-system ionizing radiation environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","volume":"43","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5277099","publicationDate":"April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Total-dose issues for microelectronics in space systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-dose issues for microelectronics in space systems","sourcePdf":"00490892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06296S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"35","articleId":"490892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":490893,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Once avionics SEU was shown to be an actual effect, it had to be dealt with in avionics designs.

These can completely describe the reaction processes, including the effect of nuclear reactions occurring outside the device-sensitive volume. They have not included the elastic-scattering processes. The article describes the semiempirical approaches that are most widely used. The quality of previous upset predictions relative to space observations is discussed and leads to comments about the desired quality of future predictions. Brief sections treat the possible testing limitation due to total ionizing dose effects, the relationship of proton and heavy-ion upsets, upsets due to direct proton ionization, and relative proton and cosmic-ray upset rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490896/","volume":"43","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5277104","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Approaches to proton single-event rate calculations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaches to proton single-event rate calculations","sourcePdf":"00490896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065627S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"57","articleId":"490896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":490897,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

In the former case, individual proton tracks will be seen; in the latter, dark-current spikes (or hot pixels) and trapping states that cause degradation in charge-transfer efficiency will be observed.

However, because of the cost and limited accessibility associated with accelerator testing, there is considerable interest in developing alternate testing methods. Two laboratory techniques for measuring SEE, one involving a pulsed laser and the other /sup 252/Cf, are described in detail in this paper. The pulsed laser provides information on the spatial and temporal dependence of SEE, information that has proven invaluable in understanding and mitigating SEE in spite of the differences in the physical mechanisms responsible for SEE induced by light and by ions. Considerable effort has been expended on developing /sup 252/Cf as a laboratory test for SEE, but the technique has not found wide use because it is severely limited by the low energy and short range of the emitted ions that are unable to reach junctions either covered with dielectric layers or deep below the surface. In fact, there are documented cases where single-event latchup (SEL) testing with /sup 252/Cf gave significantly different results from accelerator testing. A detailed comparison of laboratory and accelerator SEE data is presented in this review in order to establish the limits of each technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laboratory tests for single-event effects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.490911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/10559/00490911.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.490911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","displayDocTitle":"Laboratory tests for single-event effects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5277119","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laboratory tests for single-event effects","sourcePdf":"00490911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047521S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"66","articleId":"490911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":490912,"authors":[{"name":"F.W.

Apertured microbeam systems have been used since the early 1980s to study charge collection. This has led to the development of the present models for the transport of charge following heavy-ion strikes in semiconductors. More recently, magnetically focused scanned microbeams have allowed direct imaging of charge collection regions with a technique called IBICC (ion-beam induced charge collection). Charge collection depth can be extracted from the pulse height spectrum from well-defined regions of the IC. When applied to single event upset, those regions sensitive to upset have been directly mapped with scanned microbeam systems. Damage effects due to total-ionizing dose and displacement damage are discussed. These techniques have removed uncertainty associated with broad-beam techniques, and improved our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for single-event effects in ICs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microbeam studies of single-event effects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.490912","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/10559/00490912.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.490912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=490912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/490912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","displayDocTitle":"Microbeam studies of single-event effects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5277120","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microbeam studies of single-event effects","sourcePdf":"00490912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076285S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"50","articleId":"490912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":490913,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Of particular interest in packet traffic modeling is a property called long-range dependence (LRD), which is marked by the presence of correlations that can extend over many time scales. We demonstrate empirically that, beyond its statistical significance in traffic measurements, long-range dependence has considerable impact on queueing performance, and is a dominant characteristic for a number of packet traffic engineering problems. In addition, we give conditions under which the use of compact and simple traffic models that incorporate long-range dependence in a parsimonious manner (e.g., fractional Brownian motion) is justified and can lead to new insights into the traffic management of high speed networks.","doi":"10.1109/90.491008","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/10558/00491008.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.491008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental queueing analysis with long-range dependent packet traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491008/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental queueing analysis with long-range dependent packet traffic","volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5260970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental queueing analysis with long-range dependent packet traffic","sourcePdf":"00491008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082603S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"491","articleId":"491008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":491018,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The use of FDTD method allows for the accurate characterization of these components in a very wide frequency range. The first structure characterized through FDTD for validation purposes is a mm-wave image guide coupler. The derived theoretical results for this structure are compared to experimental data and show good agreement. Following this validation, a sub-mm wave transition from a strip-ridge line to a layered ridge dielectric waveguide (LRDW) in open environment is analyzed, and the effects of parasitic radiation on electrical performance are studied. The transition is found to be very efficient over a wide sub-mm frequency band which makes it useful for a variety of applications. In addition to the transition, a sub-mm wave distributed directional coupler made of the LRDW is extensively studied using the FDTD method as an analysis tool. Furthermore, an iterative procedure based on the FDTD models is used to design a 3-dB coupler with a center frequency of 650 GHz and negligible radiation loss. This successful design shows that the FDTD technique can be used not only as an analysis method, but also as a design tool to provide designs which take into account all high frequency parasitic effects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of three-dimensional open dielectric structures using the finite-difference time-domain method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.491018","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/10557/00491018.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.491018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491018/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of three-dimensional open dielectric structures using the finite-difference time-domain method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5258985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of three-dimensional open dielectric structures using the finite-difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00491018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045676S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","articleId":"491018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491022,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For the VSIE method, a generalized calculation method is developed to help us directly determine E fields at any interface combination in three-dimensional (3-D) electrically inhomogeneous media. The VSIE implementation described is based on separating the domain of interest into discrete parts using nonuniform tetrahedral grids. Interfaces are described using curved or plane triangles. Applying linear nodal elements, a general 3-D formulation is developed for handling scatter field contributions in the immediate vicinity of grid nodes, and this formulation is applicable to all multiregion junctions. The special case of a smooth interface around a grid node is given naturally by this formulation. Grid nodes are split into pairs of points for E-field calculation, and node normals are assigned to these points. The pairs of points are assigned to the elements adjoining the grid node. For each pair of points, the correct field jumps on the interface are given by a surface integral over the polarization surface charge density.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A volume-surface integral equation method for solving Maxwell's equations in electrically inhomogeneous media using tetrahedral grids","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.491022","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/10557/00491022.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.491022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"A volume-surface integral equation method for solving Maxwell's equations in electrically inhomogeneous media using tetrahedral grids","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5258989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A volume-surface integral equation method for solving Maxwell's equations in electrically inhomogeneous media using tetrahedral grids","sourcePdf":"00491022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045246S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","articleId":"491022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491023,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper presents a computer-based tracking control approach for a piezoceramic actuator based on incorporating a feedforward loop with a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) feedback controller. The hysteresis nonlinearity of the piezoceramic actuator is modeled in the feedforward loop by using the classical Preisach model. Experiments were performed on a stacked piezoceramic actuator for tracking sinusoidal waveforms with signal frequencies ranging from 0.1-20 Hz. A comparison was made between a feedforward control scheme, a regular PID feedback control scheme, and a PID feedback control scheme with hysteresis modeling in the feedforward loop. The results show that the tracking control performance is greatly improved by augmenting the feedback loop with a model of hysteresis in the feedforward loop. The maximum error in tracking a sinusoidal waveform is about half that obtained using a regular PID controller.","doi":"10.1109/87.491195","startPage":"209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/10542/00491195.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.491195","endPage":"216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking control of a piezoceramic actuator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Tracking control of a piezoceramic actuator","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5266766","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking control of a piezoceramic actuator","sourcePdf":"00491195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033563S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"508","articleId":"491195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491198,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We present a simple technique that exploits the polarization dependence of fiber (FWM) crosstalk generation in order to reduce FWM crosstalk levels in such systems. By allocating the polarization states of the channels optimally in relation tea each other, the FWM crosstalk at the channel wavelengths earn be reduced significantly compared to simple alternate polarization allocation schemes. The principle has been demonstrated experimentally in a dense WDM optical communication system.","doi":"10.1109/68.491231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/10564/00491231.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.491231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization allocation schemes for minimizing fiber four-wave mixing crosstalk in wavelength division multiplexed optical communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491231/","displayDocTitle":"Polarization allocation schemes for minimizing fiber four-wave mixing crosstalk in wavelength division multiplexed optical communication systems","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5246205","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization allocation schemes for minimizing fiber four-wave mixing crosstalk in wavelength division multiplexed optical communication systems","sourcePdf":"00491231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031493S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"9","articleId":"491231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":491239,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This calls for proper incorporation of a priori knowledge about the image and the point-spread function (PSF). A well-known space-adaptive regularization method for image restoration is extended to address this problem. This new method effectively utilizes, among others, the piecewise smoothness of both the image and the PSF. It attempts to minimize a cost function consisting of a restoration error measure and two regularization terms (one for the image and the other for the blur) subject to other hard constraints. A scale problem inherent to the cost function is identified, which, if not properly treated, may hinder the minimization/blind restoration process. Alternating minimization is proposed to solve this problem so that algorithmic efficiency as well as simplicity is significantly increased. Two implementations of alternating minimization based on steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods are presented. Good performance is observed with numerically and photographically blurred images, even though no stringent assumptions about the structure of the underlying blur operator is made.","doi":"10.1109/83.491316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/10547/00491316.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.491316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10547","startPage":"416","endPage":"428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A regularization approach to joint blur identification and image restoration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A regularization approach to joint blur identification and image restoration","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1996","accessionNumber":"5253132","pubMedId":"18285128","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A regularization approach to joint blur identification and image restoration","sourcePdf":"00491316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041689S","chronDate":"March  1996","isNumber":"10547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"247","articleId":"491316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":491318,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We establish that the least square (LS) estimator is the only reasonable choice for this task, and we prove its asymptotic consistency and normality for a general class of random fields that includes Gaussian Markov fields as a special case. The performance of this estimator when applied to textured images of real surfaces is poor if small boxes are used (20/spl times/20 or less). We investigate the nature of this problem by comparing the behavior predicted by the rigorous theory to the one that has been experimentally observed. Our analysis reveals that 20/spl times/20 samples contain enough information to distinguish between the textures in our experiments and that the poor performance mentioned above should be attributed to the fact that conditional Markov fields do not provide accurate models for textured images of many real surfaces. A more general model that exploits more efficiently the information contained in small samples is also suggested.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.491318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/10547/00491318.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"458","doi":"10.1109/83.491318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical and experimental study of the performance of Markov random fields applied to textured images using small samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1996","displayDocTitle":"An analytical and experimental study of the performance of Markov random fields applied to textured images using small samples","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1996","accessionNumber":"5253134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18285130","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical and experimental study of the performance of Markov random fields applied to textured images using small samples","sourcePdf":"00491318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034365S","chronDate":"March  1996","isNumber":"10547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"16","articleId":"491318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":491321,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

In particular, a variety of such algorithms have been proposed for maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction from emission tomographic data. While MAP estimation requires the solution of an optimization problem, most existing reconstruction algorithms take an indirect approach based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We propose a new approach to statistically optimal image reconstruction based on direct optimization of the MAP criterion. The key to this direct optimization approach is greedy pixel-wise computations known as iterative coordinate decent (ICD). We propose a novel method for computing the ICD updates, which we call ICD/Newton-Raphson. We show that ICD/Newton-Raphson requires approximately the same amount of computation per iteration as EM-based approaches, but the new method converges much more rapidly (in our experiments, typically five to ten iterations). Other advantages of the ICD/Newton-Raphson method are that it is easily applied to MAP estimation of transmission tomograms, and typical convex constraints, such as positivity, are easily incorporated.","doi":"10.1109/83.491321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.491321","endPage":"492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/10547/00491321.pdf","startPage":"480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to statistical tomography using coordinate descent optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491321/","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to statistical tomography using coordinate descent optimization","volume":"5","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5253137","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18285133","publicationDate":"March 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to statistical tomography using coordinate descent optimization","sourcePdf":"00491321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026806S","chronDate":"March  1996","isNumber":"10547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"288","articleId":"491321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":491333,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

If these variable-length blocks are transmitted consecutively, then the resulting coder is highly sensitive to channel errors. Synchronization code words are often used to provide occasional resynchronization at the expense of some added redundant information. This paper introduces the error-resilient entropy code (EREC) as a method for adapting existing schemes to give increased resilience to random and burst errors while maintaining high compression. The EREC has been designed to exhibit graceful degradation with worsening channel conditions. The EREC is applicable to many problems and is particularly effective when the more important information is transmitted near the start of each variable-length block and is not dependent on following data. The EREC has been applied to both still image and video compression schemes, using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and variable-length coding. The results have been compared to schemes using synchronization code words, and a large improvement in performance for noisy channels has been observed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/10548/00491333.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The EREC: an error-resilient technique for coding variable-length blocks of data","doi":"10.1109/83.491333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.491333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","displayDocTitle":"The EREC: an error-resilient technique for coding variable-length blocks of data","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5266218","pubMedId":"18285145","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The EREC: an error-resilient technique for coding variable-length blocks of data","sourcePdf":"00491333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038567S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"180","articleId":"491333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":491334,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

This is accomplished through a multiscale Kalman smoothing filter applied to a prefiltered observed image in the discrete, separable, 2-D wavelet domain. The prefiltering step involves constrained least-squares filtering based on optimal choices for the regularization parameter. This leads to a reduction in the support of the required state vectors of the multiscale restoration filter in the wavelet domain and improvement in the computational efficiency of the multiscale filter. The proposed method has the benefit that the majority of the regularization, or noise suppression, of the restoration is accomplished by the efficient multiscale filtering of wavelet detail coefficients ordered on quadtrees. Not only does this lead to potential parallel implementation schemes, but it permits adaptivity to the local edge information in the image. In particular, this method changes filter parameters depending on scale, local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and orientation. Because the wavelet detail coefficients are a manifestation of the multiscale edge information in an image, this algorithm may be viewed as an \"edge-adaptive\" multiscale restoration approach.","doi":"10.1109/83.491338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/10548/00491338.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.491338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially adaptive wavelet-based multiscale image restoration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491338/","displayDocTitle":"Spatially adaptive wavelet-based multiscale image restoration","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5266223","pubMedId":"18285150","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially adaptive wavelet-based multiscale image restoration","sourcePdf":"00491338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10703S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"88","articleId":"491338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491340,"authors":[{"name":"Gnoping Qiu","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Derby, Derby, UK"],"lastName":"Gnoping Qiu","id":"37087462394"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"491340","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491340","abstract":"In a recent publication, it was shown that median filtering is an optimization process in which a two-term cost function is minimized.

A procedure has been developed to predict the steady state and dynamic performances of a brushless permanent magnet synchronous motor. Finite element analysis has been combined with a lumped parameter circuit model in order to provide satisfactory engineering information. To this end, two coordinated steps are involved. One is to develop a unified lumped parameter circuit model for both steady state and dynamic analysis. The second step is to extract the individual lumped parameters from finite element solutions based on corresponding equivalent circuits, each with a pre-determined topology. The proposed techniques have been experimentally verified in a laboratory permanent magnet synchronous motor.","doi":"10.1109/41.491349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"256","endPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/10551/00491349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.491349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of brushless permanent magnet synchronous motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Permanent magnet motors","Synchronous motors","DC motors","Brushless DC motors","Rotors","Reactive power","AC motors","Circuits","Brushes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless machines","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","machine theory","finite element analysis","starting","equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless permanent magnet synchronous motors","steady state performance prediction","dynamic performance prediction","finite element analysis","equivalent circuits","starting performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of brushless permanent magnet synchronous motors","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5251018","publicationDate":"April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491349/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of brushless permanent magnet synchronous motors","sourcePdf":"00491349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03969S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"163","articleId":"491349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491353,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, permanent magnet type bearingless motors, having built-in capability to achieve high power factor and high efficiency, are proposed. The shaft is suspended and centered by electromagnetic forces produced by currents in the additional radial force windings of the stator slots. At first the relationships of these radial forces, currents and voltages are derived analytically. Moreover, the relationships between radial forces and permanent magnet thickness are found. The optimal permanent magnet thickness is determined. The ratio of radial force over current as well as the peak air-gap flux density are discussed. These relationships are confirmed by prototype machines.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491353","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Magnetic levitation","Permanent magnet motors","Shafts","Permanent magnets","Magnetic flux","Electric machines","Machine tools","Pumps","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","permanent magnets","machine theory","stators","design engineering","electromagnetic forces","rotors","magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet bearingless motors","power ratings","high-speed motors","shaft length","power factor","efficiency","electromagnetic forces","permanent magnet thickness","radial force windings","stator slot currents","peak air-gap flux density"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/10551/00491353.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.491353","doi":"10.1109/41.491353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of permanent magnet-type bearingless motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491353/","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of permanent magnet-type bearingless motors","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251022","volume":"43","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of permanent magnet-type bearingless motors","sourcePdf":"00491353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071192S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"85","articleId":"491353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491354,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, these sensors are undesirable from standpoints of size, cost, maintenance, and reliability. There are different ways of approaching this problem, depending on the flux distribution. The paper presents the speed and position sensorless control of PM brushless DC motors with a sinusoidal flux distribution. Two approaches are presented and compared with each other; one is based on the voltage model of the motor and another is based on the current model. The starting procedure is also a very difficult problem under sensorless drives, because the sensorless drive algorithm uses voltage and current for estimation of rotor position, but no information is available before starting. A novel starting method is presented by using a salient-pole machine.

The consequences are speed oscillations which, although small in magnitude, deteriorate the performance of the drive in demanding applications. The parasitic effects are analyzed and modeled using the complex state-variable approach. A fast current control system is employed to produce high-frequency electromagnetic torque components for compensation. A self-commissioning scheme is described which identifies the machine parameters, particularly the torque ripple functions which depend on the angular position of the rotor. Variations of permanent magnet flux density with temperature are compensated by on-line adaptation. The algorithms for adaptation and control are implemented in a standard microcontroller system without additional hardware. The effectiveness of the adaptive torque ripple compensation is demonstrated by experiments.","doi":"10.1109/41.491355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/10551/00491355.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.491355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and compensation of torque ripple in high-precision permanent magnet motor drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491355/","displayDocTitle":"Identification and compensation of torque ripple in high-precision permanent magnet motor drives","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251024","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and compensation of torque ripple in high-precision permanent magnet motor drives","sourcePdf":"00491355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022948S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"192","articleId":"491355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":491356,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

This paper reviews a wide range of motor- and controller-based design techniques that have been described in the literature for minimizing the generation of cogging and ripple torques in both sinusoidal and trapezoidal PMAC motor drives. Sinusoidal PMAC drives generally show the greatest potential for pulsating torque minimization using well-known motor design techniques such as skewing and fractional slot pitch windings. In contrast, trapezoidal PMAC drives pose more difficult trade-offs in both the motor and controller design which may require compromises in drive simplicity: and cost to improve torque smoothness. Controller-based techniques for minimizing pulsating torque typically involve the use of active cancellation algorithms which depend on either accurate tuning or adaptive control schemes for effectiveness. In the end, successful suppression of pulsating torque ultimately relies on an orchestrated systems approach to all aspects of the PMAC machine and controller design which often requires a carefully selected combination of minimization techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsating torque minimization techniques for permanent magnet AC motor drives-a review","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.491356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/10551/00491356.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.491356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Pulsating torque minimization techniques for permanent magnet AC motor drives-a review","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251025","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsating torque minimization techniques for permanent magnet AC motor drives-a review","sourcePdf":"00491356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063737S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"751","articleId":"491356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491357,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

These PM motors are all brushless and consist of various types, namely rectangular-fed, sinusoidal-fed, surface-magnet, buried-magnet, and hybrid. The advent of novel motor configurations lies on the unique electromagnetic topology, including the concept of multipole magnetic circuit and full slot-pitch coil span arrangements, leading to a reduction in both magnetic yoke and copper, decoupling of each phase flux path, and hence an increase in both power density and efficiency. Moreover, with the use of fractional number of slots per pole per phase, the cogging torque can be eliminated. On the other hand, by employing the claw-type rotor structure and fixing an additional field winding as the inner stator, these PM hybrid motors can further provide excellent controllability and improve efficiency map. In the PM motors, by purposely making use of the transformer EMF to prevent the current regulator from saturation, a novel control approach is developed to allow for attaining high-speed constant-power operation which is particularly essential for electric vehicles during cruising. Their design philosophy, control strategy, theoretical analysis, computer simulation, experimental tests and application to electric vehicles are described.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel permanent magnet motor drives for electric vehicles","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.491357","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/10551/00491357.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.491357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Novel permanent magnet motor drives for electric vehicles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251026","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel permanent magnet motor drives for electric vehicles","sourcePdf":"00491357.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046097S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"122","articleId":"491357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491385,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Low-gain SOA's were used to minimize ASE noise considering that no optical filters can be integrated in an SOA-based switch fabric. The system performance with and without a narrowband optical filter at the receiver were both studied. By assuming fixed-wavelength transmitters and no optical filter can be used at the receiving end owing to the unpredictability of arriving packet wavelengths, our simulation results indicate that the dynamic ranges of 4/spl times/4 and 8/spl times/8 SOA-based packet switches at 2.5 Gb/s can only be about 3.2 and 0.8 dB, respectively. However, at 155 Mb/s, even without a receiving-end optical filter, the dynamic range of each switch size can be increased by more than 17 dB as compared to the cases of 2.5 Gb/s. Note that the dynamic ranges were estimated under the conditions of a bit error rate (BER) /spl les/10/sup -9/ and a pulse distortion ratio /spl les/30%. We have also shown that, when an optical filter with a 1 nm bandwidth was used at the receiving end to simulate (1) a circuit-switched condition where the center wavelength of the filter can be adjusted according to the established circuit, or (2) a packet-switched condition where each receiver has a wavelength demultiplexer and a detector array, the dynamic range of 4/spl times/4 and 8/spl times/8 switches can be increased to 16.3 and 14 dB, respectively, at 2.5 Gb/s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251481","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic range and switching speed limitations of an N/spl times/N optical packet switch based on low-gain semiconductor optical amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic range and switching speed limitations of an N/spl times/N optical packet switch based on low-gain semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00491389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033755S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","articleId":"491389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":491395,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The model assumes that each erbium ion possesses an ellipsoidal gain surface and that all ion orientations are equally likely. By dividing the ions into subsets based upon orientation and computing the inversion of each subset in the presence of polarized pump and signal waves, the model predicts the dependence of the PDG induced by this polarization hole-burning (PHB) on the design of the EDFA, the signal degree and state of polarization (SOP), and the pump SOP. For moderate gain amplifiers (made from the same fiber) with the same gain peak wavelength and the same compression level, the magnitude of the PDG is nearly independent of the EDFA gain. Internal and random fiber birefringence are included to model real fibers. In fibers which cause the signal SOP to walk rapidly around the Poincare sphere, the PDG is reduced by a factor of 2/3 when compared with a linear polarization-maintained signal. Scrambled signals and partially-polarized saturating tones are also considered. Simple rules are derived for predicting the PDG of a given EDFA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber polarization","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Harmonic analysis","Absorption","Predictive models","Wavelength measurement","Glass","Erbium-doped fiber lasers","Laser modes","Laser theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","optical fibre polarisation","birefringence","optical fibre theory","optical pumping","optical hole burning","optical saturation","modelling","optical communication equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization dependent gain","erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","computer model","approximate formulas","Er-doped fiber amplifiers","erbium ion","ellipsoidal gain surface","ion orientations","polarized pump","signal waves","polarization hole-burning","state of polarization","pump SOP","moderate gain amplifiers","gain peak wavelength","compression level","EDFA gain","random fiber birefringence","Poincare sphere","linear polarization-maintained signal","scrambled signals","partially-polarized saturating tones"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.491395","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10552/00491395.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.491395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization dependent gain in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: computer model and approximate formulas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polarization dependent gain in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: computer model and approximate formulas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491395/","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5251487","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization dependent gain in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: computer model and approximate formulas","sourcePdf":"00491395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045122S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"40","articleId":"491395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":491410,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This approach has the advantage of an intuitive interpretation of the algorithm parameters as well as fast (near real time) image reconstruction. In order to compare this approach to existing algorithms, the authors develop figures of merit to measure the reconstructed image resolution, the noise amplification of the image reconstruction, and the fidelity of positioning in the image.

The proposed two-level CNN architecture is proven to be promising and to be extensible, problem-independent, and therefore, applicable to other medical or difficult diagnostic tasks in two-dimensional (2-D) image environments.","doi":"10.1109/42.491422","startPage":"206","endPage":"217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.491422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/10554/00491422.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of false positives in lung nodule detection using a two-level neural classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491422/","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of false positives in lung nodule detection using a two-level neural classification","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5244073","pubMedId":"18215903","publicationDate":"April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of false positives in lung nodule detection using a two-level neural classification","sourcePdf":"00491422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072334S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"55","articleId":"491422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":491423,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

Individual grains are difficult to detect and segment due to size and shape variability and because the background mammogram texture is typically inhomogeneous. The authors develop a 2-stage method based on wavelet transforms for detecting and segmenting calcifications. The first stage is based on an undecimated wavelet transform, which is simply the conventional filter bank implementation without downsampling, so that the low-low (LL), low-high (LH), high-low (HL), and high-high (HH) sub-bands remain at full size. Detection takes place in HH and the combination LH+HL. Four octaves are computed with 2 inter-octave voices for finer scale resolution. By appropriate selection of the wavelet basis the detection of microcalcifications in the relevant size range can be nearly optimized. In fact, the filters which transform the input image into HH and LH+HL are closely related to prewhitening matched filters for detecting Gaussian objects (idealized microcalcifications) in 2 common forms of Markov (background) noise. The second stage is designed to overcome the limitations of the simplistic Gaussian assumption and provides an accurate segmentation of calcification boundaries. Detected pixel sites in HH and LH+HL are dilated then weighted before computing the inverse wavelet transform. Individual microcalcifications are greatly enhanced in the output image, to the point where straightforward thresholding can be applied to segment them. FROG curves are computed from tests using a freely distributed database of digitized mammograms.","doi":"10.1109/42.491423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/10554/00491423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.491423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10554","startPage":"218","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transforms for detecting microcalcifications in mammograms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transforms for detecting microcalcifications in mammograms","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5251142","pubMedId":"18215904","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transforms for detecting microcalcifications in mammograms","sourcePdf":"00491423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048725S","chronDate":"April  1996","isNumber":"10554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"228","articleId":"491423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":491451,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An alternative approach, described in the paper, is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to aid the development of formal descriptions from requirements expressed in controlled natural language. While many problems in NLP remain unsolved, we show that suitable extensions to existing tools provide a useful platform for detecting and resolving ambiguities.

It is proposed that under PWM operation these same problems are now predominantly an electrostatic phenomenon. A system model to describe this phenomenon is characterized and developed.

The DCC-SMR is unique in that no bilateral switching device is used in the frequency conversion circuit. Therefore, the authors have used a DC snubber circuit in conjunction with the switching device of the DCC-SMR. This DC snubber circuit features a very simple structure consisting only of a capacitor with no need for a discharge resistance or for a complicated regenerative circuit for snubber energy. This is because snubber energy is regenerated on the primary side of the high frequency (HF) transformer by the main switch. Furthermore, an innovative method has been applied for magnetic saturation-preventive control of the HF transformer. The authors carried out operational checks on the main circuit and the snubber circuit of the DCC-SMR as well as on the magnetic saturation-preventive control circuit, and through experiments confirmed a satisfactory result. We manufactured an industrial DC power supply prototype of the DCC-SMR system having a DC output of 100 kW (100 V, 1000 A), with which input/output conversion efficiency 91.6%, input power factor 0.99 and input current total harmonic distortion factor 4.6% were obtained.","doi":"10.1109/28.491481","startPage":"326","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.491481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10550","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/10550/00491481.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel three-phase SMR converter with inherent snubber energy recovery capability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491481/","displayDocTitle":"Novel three-phase SMR converter with inherent snubber energy recovery capability","volume":"32","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5245086","publicationDate":"March-April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel three-phase SMR converter with inherent snubber energy recovery capability","sourcePdf":"00491481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030083S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1996","isNumber":"10550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"5","articleId":"491481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":491485,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed bearingless motor is a 4 pole permanent magnet synchronous motor, in which additional 2-pole windings are wound together with 4-pole motor windings in stator slots. With currents of 2-pole windings, radial magnetic forces are produced to support a rotor shaft. Principles of radial force production of surface-mounted permanent magnet bearingless motors are analyzed mathematically. It was found that radial forces are efficiently produced by employing thin permanent magnets on the surface of rotor iron core.

In the authors' analysis, surface-mounted linear motors consisting of permanent magnets and ironless current-carrying coils are treated in a uniform way via the magnetic vector potential. This analysis is developed to design novel linear magnetic levitators for driving precision motion control stages such as those used in wafer steppers. For one such motor structure, they give analytical formulae for its magnetic field, force, flux linkage, inductance of the winding, and back electromotive force. They provide experimental results with a six degree-of-freedom magnetic levitator. These results are in good agreement with analytical estimations. The levitator uses a permanent-magnet Halbach array in order to improve its power efficiency. By analogy, there also exists an electromagnetic dual of the Halbach array. One such dual utilizes a triangular winding pattern in order to achieve a primarily single-sided magnetic field.","doi":"10.1109/28.491486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/10550/00491486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.491486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10550","startPage":"371","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis framework for linear permanent-magnet machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis framework for linear permanent-magnet machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 1996","accessionNumber":"5245091","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis framework for linear permanent-magnet machines","sourcePdf":"00491486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065769S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1996","isNumber":"10550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"187","articleId":"491486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491498,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

Over the past several years, practical methods have been developed for measuring the partial discharge activity in the high voltage insulation of stator windings, since partial discharges are a symptom of most of the insulation failure mechanisms in motors and generators rated 4 kV or more. The turbine generator analyzer (TGA) test has now been specifically developed to enable industrial plant staff to reliably perform a partial discharge test on operating motors and turbine generators. This paper presents several case studies of the use of these new partial discharge test technologies on rotating machines. Test results show that machines with deteriorated windings have a partial discharge activity at least 30 times higher than good windings. The availability of these test methods enables plant staff to economically and reliably plan stator winding maintenance, avoid unexpected failures and often extend the time between major maintenance outages.","doi":"10.1109/28.491498","startPage":"459","endPage":"464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/10550/00491498.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.491498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of partial discharge testing to motor and generator stator winding maintenance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Testing","Stator windings","Insulation","Turbines","Machine windings","Maintenance","Partial discharge measurement","Voltage","Failure analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","turbogenerators","insulation testing","machine insulation","machine testing","electric breakdown","partial discharges","stators","maintenance engineering","failure analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motors","turbine generators","partial discharge testing","winding maintenance","stator winding insulation","high voltage insulation","failure mechanisms","rotating machines","partial discharge activity","maintenance outages","4 kV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491498/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Application of partial discharge testing to motor and generator stator winding maintenance","volume":"32","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5251752","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of partial discharge testing to motor and generator stator winding maintenance","sourcePdf":"00491498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031409S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1996","isNumber":"10550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"61","articleId":"491498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":491502,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, University of Missouri, Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Hao Shi","id":"37350395800"},{"name":"J.L.

The theoretical results, from calculations performed at a wavelength of 1.54 \u03bcm and bit rate of 25 Mb/s demonstrate that the receiver is approximately 1.5 dB more sensitive than an earlier optically preamplified PPM receiver and also more sensitive than the fundamental limit of optically preamplified on-off keyed (OOK) NRZ signalling.

By introducing strong \"clipping tones\" (optical-modulation depth >1) on each of the lasers their optical spectrum can be broadened, thereby ameliorating the effects of OBI. By carefully selecting the RF band used to carry signals, and that used for \"clipping tones\", OBI can be reduced without the clipping inducing errors. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique by measuring the BER of a QPSK channel in the presence of OBI.

The merits of this choice, from use in telecommunications networks, include low cost and proven reliability. Indeed, it has been shown that these devices can transmit multiple quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signals in an error-free manner. However, there is a bit-error-rate (BER) penalty associated with these lasers, that impacts the useable error free range. We show this degradation is caused by laser sporadic noise generated by Rayleigh backscatter into the laser from the fiber plant.

Furthermore, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the invariants obtained by normalization. Their main advantage is that the normalization process provides us with a standard position of the object.

By combining graduated nonconvexity, two-way (assignment) constraints, and sparsity, large improvements in accuracy and speed are achieved. Its low order computational complexity [O(lm), where l and m are the number of links in the two graphs] and robustness in the presence of noise offer advantages over traditional combinatorial approaches. The algorithm, not restricted to any special class of graph, is applied to subgraph isomorphism, weighted graph matching, and attributed relational graph matching. To illustrate the performance of the algorithm, attributed relational graphs derived from objects are matched. Then, results from twenty-five thousand experiments conducted on 100 mode random graphs of varying types (graphs with only zero-one links, weighted graphs, and graphs with node attributes and multiple link types) are reported. No comparable results have been reported by any other graph matching algorithm before in the research literature.

However, in image analysis research, exploiting motion smear has been largely ignored. Rather, motion smear is usually considered as a degradation of images that needs to be removed. In this paper, the authors establish a computational model that estimates image motion from motion smear information-\"motion from smear\". In many real situations, the shutter of the sensing camera must be kept open long enough to produce images of adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in significant motion smear in images. The authors present a new motion blur model and an algorithm that enables unique estimation of image motion. A prototype sensor system that exploits the new motion blur model has been built to acquire data for \"motion-from-smear\". Experimental results on images with both simulated smear and real smear, using the authors' \"motion-from-smear\" algorithm as well as a conventional motion estimation technique, are provided. The authors also show that temporal aliasing does not affect \"motion-from-smear\" to the same degree as it does algorithms that use displacement as a cue. \"Motion-from-smear\" provides an additional tool for motion estimation and effectively complements the existing techniques when apparent motion smear is present.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5271132","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Image motion estimation from motion smear-a new computational model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image motion estimation from motion smear-a new computational model","sourcePdf":"00491622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046834S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"55","articleId":"491622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":491625,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method employed in this paper makes use of a deformable template model of the expected road edges, a two-parameter log-normal model of the ground-level millimeter-wave (GLEM) radar imaging process, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation of the straight edge detection problem, and a Monte Carlo algorithm to maximize the posterior density. Experimental results are presented by applying the method on GLEM radar images of actual roads.

The bridged chopper has two switches that alternately conduct. The duty cycles of the conduction of the switches are complementary with one another and are varied to control the output voltage. Three resonant circuit configurations suitable for this type of control are presented. Frequency domain analysis of the converter is given, and performance characteristics are presented.

The aim is to limit and stabilize variations of DC output voltage and line currents in such circumstances. Network variations can result in costly damage to power converters and their loads but a power converter such as the PWM rectifier, using cascade digital control, offers many capabilities to stabilize the system with optimized control. A generalized model of the PWM rectifier is first presented using the Clarke notation in order to separate the positive and negative sequences. The model is also extended to the harmonics. The cases of harmonic disturbance and an unbalanced network are then analyzed and an optimized regulation is presented for the latter case, validating the generalized model. Experimental results are proposed. The line current compensation loop method coupled with identification of network parameters offers a good solution to stabilize the PWM rectifier in an unbalanced network.","doi":"10.1109/63.491644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/10585/00491644.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.491644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regulation of a PWM rectifier in the unbalanced network state using a generalized model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491644/","displayDocTitle":"Regulation of a PWM rectifier in the unbalanced network state using a generalized model","volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5278154","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regulation of a PWM rectifier in the unbalanced network state using a generalized model","sourcePdf":"00491644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023543S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"217","articleId":"491644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":491657,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Systems, University of Osaka Prefecture, Sakai, Japan"],"lastName":"Ling Chen","id":"37350976300"},{"name":"H.

The floating-body potential is affected by the bitline so changes in the bitline potential may upset the charge stored in the memory cell. Transient effects in SOI access transistors are measured versus the time the bitline is at high voltage, and V/sub DD/ for fully- and partially-depleted SOI devices. Bulk devices show no bitline-induced transient effects. Measurements show that the magnitude of the charge upset can be large enough to disturb the charge stored in DRAM and SRAM cells. Measurements also show that for any substantial upsets to occur, the time the bitline has to be at high voltage is on the order of milliseconds. Although the effect of bitline transitions is cumulative, the amount of charge upset when the bitline switches rapidly (i.e., millisecond periods) is shown to be negligible. Thus, proper design of SRAM upset-charge protection and DRAM refresh time should circumvent this problem.","doi":"10.1109/55.491826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.491826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/10451/00491826.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of transient effects in SOI DRAM/SRAM access transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of transient effects in SOI DRAM/SRAM access transistors","volume":"17","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5271151","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/491826/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of transient effects in SOI DRAM/SRAM access transistors","sourcePdf":"00491826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034217S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"37","articleId":"491826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":491835,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.

Optical-fiber communication systems and millimeter-wave radio communication systems will play decisive roles, and essential high-speed digital ICs and MMICs will be the key devices in these systems. The InP-based heterostructure electron devices, such as HEMTs and HBTs, are thought to be the most promising candidates for these applications. To date, ultimate high f/sub T/ and f/sub max/ were well demonstrated using HEMTs based on InP. Consequently, much effort is being devoted to millimeter-wave, baseband, and digital applications.

As a result of the systematic investigations of the low-level E-J characteristics and the corresponding changes of net oxide charge, we have found that SIEC can be interpreted as electron tunneling processes into five kinds of different traps. As for the reproducible SIEC components, a quantitative analysis has been developed. By precisely modeling the trap assisted tunneling process, it has been shown that the E-J and t-J characteristics of the pretunneling region can be completely simulated as an electron tunneling process into the neutral trap. Using this analysis, it has been found that the local neutral trap density in bulk SiO/sub 2/ remains constant under the same hole fluence Qhole, regardless of the electric field strength during V/sub g/>0 FN stresses. In consequence, it has been concluded that the neutral trap has been created by holes injected into the oxide during the stresses.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3523/10603/00492067.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10603","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quantitative analysis of stress induced excess current (SIEC) in SiO/sub 2/ films","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","Voltage","Stress measurement","Charge measurement","Electrical resistance measurement","Tunneling","Electric variables measurement","IEL","Channel bank filters","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","ULSI","electron traps","tunnelling","hot carriers","integrated circuit testing","silicon compounds","insulating thin films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stress induced excess current","wet oxide","low-level E-J characteristics","electron tunneling processes","trap assisted tunneling process","local neutral trap density","electric field strength","ULSI","MOS ICs","92 angstrom","SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","displayDocTitle":"A quantitative analysis of stress induced excess current (SIEC) in SiO/sub 2/ films","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5368592","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantitative analysis of stress induced excess current (SIEC) in SiO/sub 2/ films","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00492067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041573S","chronDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","isNumber":"10603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3523","citationCount":"29","articleId":"492067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":492068,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The excess current induced by F-N stress is caused by the injected holes produced by high-energy-electrons. Dielectric breakdown caused by hot-hole injection has also been studied, and it is revealed that the total positive charge to breakdown (Q/sub p/) is independent of the oxide field. This supports previous measurement that the Q/sub p/ value is constant during F-N stress. The annealing-recovery mechanism in the dielectric breakdown is different from that in the excess current, though both are caused by the hot-hole injection.","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492069","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3523/10603/00492069.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Excess currents induced by hot-hole injection and F-N stress in thin SiO/sub 2/ films [flash memories]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492069","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492069/","displayDocTitle":"Excess currents induced by hot-hole injection and F-N stress in thin SiO/sub 2/ films [flash memories]","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5368594","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Excess currents induced by hot-hole injection and F-N stress in thin SiO/sub 2/ films [flash memories]","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00492069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097633S","chronDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","isNumber":"10603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3523","citationCount":"13","articleId":"492069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":492079,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Tao","affiliation":["Siliconix, Inc.orporated, Santa Clara, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jiang Tao","id":"37087497755"},{"name":"J.F.

The set of points forms an N-dimensionaI cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces.

This dissemination reduces network traffic and balances load amongst servers by exploiting geographic and temporal locality of reference properties exhibited in client access patterns. Our second protocol relies on \"speculative service\", whereby a request for a document as serviced by sending, in addition to the document requested, a number of other documents that the server speculates will be requested in the near future. This speculation reduces service time by exploiting the spatial locality of reference property.

It is shown that thermal breakdown occurs when the resistances increase by a factor of >3.6 due to melting of metal lines. After the metal is molten, the thermal stress is required to exceed the fracture strength of the oxide/nitride layers in order for the overlying dielectric to be cracked and an open circuit to take place. The critical failure current is strongly influenced by the metal thickness and thermal capacity. It is shown that for current pulses below the failure threshold, the metal will return to its original solid state with no change in DC resistance, but it will have a lower electromigration lifetime. This is a potential latent failure. The model is applied to derive relations between critical current, line width and pulse width for determining design guidelines for ESD and I/O buffer interconnects.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3523/10603/00492126.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10603","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of VLSI circuit interconnect heating and failure under ESD conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Integrated circuit interconnections","Heating","Electrostatic discharge","Thermal stresses","Metallization","Thermal factors","Thermal resistance","Electric breakdown","Dielectrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","integrated circuit interconnections","failure analysis","integrated circuit reliability","electrostatic discharge","integrated circuit metallisation","thermal stresses","electromigration","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI circuit interconnect","interconnect heating","failure","ESD conditions","metallization","thermal breakdown","metal line melting","thermal stress","fracture strength","open circuit","critical failure current","thermal capacity","failure threshold","electromigration lifetime","latent failure","critical current","line width","pulse width","I/O buffer interconnects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of VLSI circuit interconnect heating and failure under ESD conditions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5375533","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of VLSI circuit interconnect heating and failure under ESD conditions","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00492126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033577S","chronDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","isNumber":"10603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3523","citationCount":"41","articleId":"492126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492135,"authors":[{"name":"I.S.

The interface trap generation post hole injection is found to be two orders of magnitude slower than that post-irradiation and cannot be satisfactorily explained by the transportation of hydrogen species across the bulk of oxide. There is a lack of correlation between the trapped hole removal and the interface trap creation, which is against the prediction of the trapped hole conversion model. It is found that the interface traps generated during and post the stress originate from two different defects. The defect responsible for the post-stress generation is excited by the hole injection and then converted into an interface trap if a positive gate bias is applied post-stress.","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492135","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","startPage":"305","endPage":"310","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3523/10603/00492135.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1996.492135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the hot hole induced post-stress interface trap generation in MOSFET's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Stress","Degradation","CMOS technology","Voltage","Electron traps","Hydrogen","Hot carriers","Predictive models","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","hot carriers","interface states","hole traps","semiconductor device reliability","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hot hole induced interface trap generation","post-stress interface trap generation","MOSFETs","post hole injection","trapped hole conversion model","positive gate bias"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the hot hole induced post-stress interface trap generation in MOSFET's","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5375542","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492135/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the hot hole induced post-stress interface trap generation in MOSFET's","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00492135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047423S","chronDate":"April 30 1996-May 2 1996","isNumber":"10603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3523","citationCount":"5","articleId":"492135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":492169,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

To solve this problem, many CAD tools have been developed, including simulation. However, as systems increase in size and complexity, simulating the system becomes very costly, both in time and space. For most cases that use simulation, only a subset of the total possible simulation patterns is used for design verification. The paper describes a simulation tool which applies effective methodologies such as: error compression and sampling, for reducing simulation time and resources. These methods satisfy confidence level expectations for design verification using either reduced design errors or reduced test sets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Circuit simulation","Computational modeling","Process design","Digital systems","Circuit faults","Design automation","Automatic testing","Robustness","Formal verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","circuit analysis computing","errors","digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation tool","design error models","error compression","error sampling","digital system design","digital system verification","CAD tools","simulation patterns","simulation time reduction","simulation resource reduction","confidence bevel expectations","reduced test sets","reduced design errors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIMSYM.1996.492169","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Annual Simulation Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Annual Simulation Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3524/10604/00492169.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIMSYM.1996.492169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation tool for design error models utilizing error compression and sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simulation tool for design error models utilizing error compression and sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492169/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5281033","conferenceDate":"8-11 April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Apr 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation tool for design error models utilizing error compression and sampling","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00492169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032937S","chronDate":"8-11 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3524","citationCount":"1","articleId":"492169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":492202,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

At room temperature, the etching is hampered by the formation of arsenic compounds and liquid phase etch products at the surface. At temperatures between 50/spl deg/C to 100/spl deg/C, the etch rate increase with temperature linearly. In this region, the surface is smooth and fine. At temperatures above 100/spl deg/C, the etching rate decreases and surface becomes grainy and rough. XPS and AES analysis suggest that oxide formation at the surface during etching in this temperature range slows down the etch rate. Schottky diodes were fabricated to compare the electrical properties of the diodes after PCE and the commonly used wet etching. The diode fabricated by PCE was superior in terms of less leakage current, smaller n factor and higher barrier height. This improvement in Schottky diode performance was found to be due to superior surface quality after PCE compared to wet etching.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPRM.1996.492272","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials","pdfPath":"/iel2/3525/10605/00492272.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"423","doi":"10.1109/ICIPRM.1996.492272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Material system using HBr gas and a 172 nm excimer lamp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Material system using HBr gas and a 172 nm excimer lamp","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 April 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5380284","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Material system using HBr gas and a 172 nm excimer lamp","confLoc":"Schwaebisch-Gmuend, Germany","sourcePdf":"00492272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033329S","chronDate":"21-25 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3525","articleId":"492272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":492331,"authors":[{"name":"S.

So recently the traveling wave amplifier (TWA) concept for high bit rate receiver systems is of increasing interest because it is the preferred amplifier concept for broadband applications like hierarchically organized communication interlinks. TWAs usually are designed with an input and output impedance of 50 /spl Omega/. Thus a main problem of the TWA-concept for an optoelectronic receiver is matching the photo-detector (PD) and the TWA input and reach the requested input RC-bandwidth. The conventional approach is a TWA with an additional 50 /spl Omega/ match resistor at the input line, which has to be integrated directly into the PD itself in order to avoid parasitics. The aim of this paper is to present an alternative concept to the match resistor realized by a TWA with a low-impedance input (25 /spl Omega/), which yields significantly reduced design and fabrication efforts. All simulations for the investigated and optimized designs of the TWA in coplanar technique have been carried out using a commercially available software. For exact noise and sensitivity simulations, an extended temperature noise model (TNM) for heterostructure field-effect transistors was developed and implemented. Finally a comparison with measurement results of the realized TWA is presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPRM.1996.492331","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials","pdfPath":"/iel2/3525/10605/00492331.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"645","doi":"10.1109/ICIPRM.1996.492331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a low-impedance traveling wave amplifier based on InAlAs/InGaAs/InP-HFET for 20 Gb/s optoelectronic receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Development of a low-impedance traveling wave amplifier based on InAlAs/InGaAs/InP-HFET for 20 Gb/s optoelectronic receivers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 April 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5384919","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492331/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a low-impedance traveling wave amplifier based on InAlAs/InGaAs/InP-HFET for 20 Gb/s optoelectronic receivers","confLoc":"Schwaebisch-Gmuend, Germany","sourcePdf":"00492331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029471S","chronDate":"21-25 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3525","citationCount":"9","articleId":"492331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":492446,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This classical problem has received much attention because of the simple model it provides of the trade-off between exploration (trying out each arm to find the best one) and exploitation (playing the arm believed to give the best payoff). Past solutions for the bandit problem have almost always relied on assumptions about the statistics of the slot machines. In this work, we make no statistical assumptions whatsoever about the nature of the process generating the payoffs of the slot machines. We give a solution to the bandit problem in which an adversary, rather than a well-behaved stochastic process, has complete control over the payoffs. In a sequence of T plays, we prove that the expected per-round payoff of our algorithm approaches that of the best arm at the rate O(T/sup -1/3/), and we give an improved rate of convergence when the best arm has fairly low payoff. We also consider a setting in which the player has a team of \"experts\" advising him on which arm to play; here, we give a strategy that will guarantee expected payoff close to that of the best expert. Finally, we apply our result to the problem of learning to play an unknown repeated matrix game against an all-powerful adversary.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 36th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 36th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/3752/10957/00492488.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gambling in a rigged casino: The adversarial multi-armed bandit problem","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1995.492488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1995.492488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Gambling in a rigged casino: The adversarial multi-armed bandit problem","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125650","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gambling in a rigged casino: The adversarial multi-armed bandit problem","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"00492488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023968S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"10957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3752","citationCount":"158","articleId":"492488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":492493,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Various methods for reducing energy consumption have been investigated, both at the circuit level and at the operating systems level. In this paper, we propose a simple model of job scheduling aimed at capturing some key aspects of energy minimization. In this model, each job is to be executed between its arrival time and deadline by a single processor with variable speed, under the assumption that energy usage per unit time, P, is a convex function, of the processor speed s. We give an off-line algorithm that computes, for any set of jobs, a minimum-energy schedule. We then consider some on-line algorithms and their competitive performance for the power function P(s)=s/sup p/ where p/spl ges/2. It is shown that one natural heuristic, called the Average Rate heuristic, uses at most a constant times the minimum energy required.

In this paper, roundoff errors in signal processing systems utilizing block-floating-point representation are studied. Special emphasis is on analysis of quantization errors when data is quantized to a block-floating-point format and on analysis of roundoff errors in digital filters utilizing block-floating-point arithmetic, block-floating-point roundoff errors are found to depend on the signal level in the same way as floating-point roundoff errors, resulting in approximately constant signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) over relatively large dynamic range. Both the analysis and simulation results show that block-floating-point is an efficient number representation format. In data representation, a superior performance to fixed- or floating-point representations can be achieved with block-floating-point representation with same total number of bits per sample. In digital filters, block-floating-point arithmetic can provide comparable performance to floating-point arithmetic with reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/78.492531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10586/00492531.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.492531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10586","startPage":"783","endPage":"790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Roundoff errors in block-floating-point systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Roundoff errors in block-floating-point systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5278972","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Roundoff errors in block-floating-point systems","sourcePdf":"00492531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039104S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","articleId":"492531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492532,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Most published works on blind equalization convergence analysis are confined to T-spaced equalizers with real-valued inputs. The common belief is that analysis of fractionally spaced equalizers (FSEss) with complex inputs is a straightforward extension with similar results. This belief is, in fact, untrue. We present a convergence analysis of Godard/CMA FSEs that proves the important advantages provided by the FSE structure. We show that an FSE allows the exploitation of the channel diversity that supports two important conclusions of great practical significance: (1) a finite-length channel satisfying a length-and-zero condition allows Godard/CMA FSE to be globally convergent, and (2) the linear FSE filter length need not be longer than the channel delay spread. Computer simulation demonstrates the performance improvement provided by the adaptive Godard FSE.","doi":"10.1109/78.492535","startPage":"818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10586/00492535.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.492535","endPage":"826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global convergence of fractionally spaced Godard (CMA) adaptive equalizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Global convergence of fractionally spaced Godard (CMA) adaptive equalizers","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5278976","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global convergence of fractionally spaced Godard (CMA) adaptive equalizers","sourcePdf":"00492535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041071S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"140","articleId":"492535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492537,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The key step towards an operations count that depends only linearly on the model order is fast eigensubspace tracking, and the property that the coefficients of a high-order N prediction filter itself constitute a perfectly (or almost perfectly) predictable sequence that can be annihilated using a low-order 2n prediction error filter that carries the desired signal frequency information in its roots. In this concept, root tracking is limited to a low-order filter polynomial, even if the overmodeling factor N/n is much larger than 1 for optimal noise suppression. Extraneous roots are not computed explicitly.

More exactly, this paper assumes that the array contains some calibrated sensors, whose number is only required to be larger than the number of signals impinging on the array, and also that the noise in the calibrated sensors is uncorrelated with the noise in the other sensors. These two noise vectors, however, may have arbitrary spatial autocovariance matrices. Under these assumptions the many nuisance parameters (viz., the elements of the signal and noise covariance matrices and the transfer and location characteristics of the uncalibrated sensors) can be eliminated from the likelihood function, leaving a significantly simplified concentrated likelihood whose maximum yields the ML bearing estimates. The ML estimator introduced in this paper, and referred to as MLE, is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to a recently proposed subspace-based bearing estimator called UNCLE and rederived herein by a much simpler approach than in the original work. A statistical analysis derives the asymptotic distribution of the MLE and UNCLE estimates, and proves that they are asymptotically equivalent and statistically efficient. In a simulation study, the MLE and UNCLE methods are found to possess very similar finite-sample properties as well. As UNCLE is computationally more efficient, it may be the preferred technique in a given application.","doi":"10.1109/78.492542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10586/00492542.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.492542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10586","startPage":"888","endPage":"899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-likelihood bearing estimation with partly calibrated arrays in spatially correlated noise fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-likelihood bearing estimation with partly calibrated arrays in spatially correlated noise fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5278983","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-likelihood bearing estimation with partly calibrated arrays in spatially correlated noise fields","sourcePdf":"00492542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107994S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"34","articleId":"492542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":492544,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

The problem considered here is detecting the presence of one or more signals of known shape embedded in Gaussian distributed noise with unknown covariance structure. The data is mapped into a subspace prior to detection. The probability of false alarm is independent of the subspace transformation and depends only on subspace dimension. The probability of detection depends on the subspace transformation through a nonadaptive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) parameter. Subspace processing results in an SNR loss that tends to decrease performance and a gain in statistical stability that tends to increase performance. It is shown that the statistical stability effect dominates the SNR loss for short data records, and subspace detectors can require substantially less SNR than full space detectors for equivalent performance. A method for designing the subspace transformation to minimize the SNR loss is proposed and illustrated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/78.492544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.492544","startPage":"912","endPage":"927","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10586/00492544.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace-based adaptive generalized likelihood ratio detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Subspace-based adaptive generalized likelihood ratio detection","publicationDate":"April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5278985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492544/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace-based adaptive generalized likelihood ratio detection","sourcePdf":"00492544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066335S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","articleId":"492544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":492546,"authors":[{"name":"M.

One of the most popular techniques is the multiple signal classification (MUSIC). The major shortcoming of the MUSIC algorithm is that it performs poorly when the sources are highly correlated. Fortunately, two algorithms exist to overcome this problem-spatial smoothing (SS) and forward-backward spatial smoothing (FBSS). The performance of the SS technique depends on signal bearings and spatial separation. For the same smoothing, FBSS can offer improved performance, but this depends on the signal phases.

We define another quantum computational model, one dimensional quantum cellular automata, and demonstrate that any quantum Turing machine can be efficiently simulated by a one dimensional quantum cellular automaton with constant slowdown. This can be accomplished by consideration of a restricted class of one dimensional quantum cellular automata called one dimensional partitioned quantum cellular automata. We also show that any one dimensional partitioned quantum cellular automaton can be simulated by a quantum Turing machine with linear slowdown, but the problem of efficiently simulating an arbitrary one dimensional quantum cellular automaton with a quantum Turing machine is left open. From this discussion, some interesting facts concerning these models are easily deduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 36th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/3752/10957/00492583.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"537","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 36th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1995.492583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1995.492583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10957","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On one-dimensional quantum cellular automata","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum cellular automata","Quantum computing","Computational modeling","Turing machines","Physics computing","Polynomials","Circuit simulation","Quantum mechanics","Computer simulation","Magnetic heads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum theory","cellular automata","Turing machines","simulation","physics computing","physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-dimensional quantum cellular automata","quantum computation","quantum computers","quantum computational model","one dimensional quantum cellular automata","quantum Turing machine","constant slowdown","one dimensional partitioned quantum cellular automata","linear slowdown","1D partitioned quantum cellular automaton simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"On one-dimensional quantum cellular automata","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125670","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On one-dimensional quantum cellular automata","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"00492583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026118S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"10957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3752","citationCount":"41","articleId":"492583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492591,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The problem is ill-conditioned, which means that a small uncertainty in the measurement causes large deviations in the reconstructed signal. This amplified noise has to be suppressed at the price of bias in the estimation. The most difficult task is to find the optimal degree of noise reduction. Deconvolution algorithms are usually controlled by one or a few parameters. Several algorithms can be found in the literature to find the best setting of inverse filtering methods; however, usually methods with only one free parameter are handled. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to optimize several parameters, on the basis of a spectral model. Multiparameter inverse filtering methods have the advantage that they can be better adapted to the measurement system, and to the noise and signal to be measured. The superiority of the proposed optimization method is demonstrated both on simulated and on experimental data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492758/","volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5277132","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Multiparameter optimization of inverse filtering algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiparameter optimization of inverse filtering algorithms","sourcePdf":"00492758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094723S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"45","articleId":"492758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":492760,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The multistage filter efficiently attenuates harmonics, wide-band noise, commutation notches, and other impulsive disturbances without causing any phase shift on the primary sinusoidal waveform. Our novel signal-processing system is a cascade of a median filter and an adaptive sinusoid predictor, followed by up-sampling and interpolation. The three-point median filter effectively removes impulses, and the predictor provides wide-band noise attenuation while compensating for delays in the other processing steps. The predictor adapts to possible line frequency variations within the specified range by changing the set of coefficients, based on an estimate of the instantaneous line frequency. The adaptive approach allows the use of highly selective IIR bandpass predictors.","doi":"10.1109/19.492760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/10596/00492760.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.492760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital filtering for robust 50/60 Hz zero-crossing detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492760/","displayDocTitle":"Digital filtering for robust 50/60 Hz zero-crossing detectors","volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5277134","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital filtering for robust 50/60 Hz zero-crossing detectors","sourcePdf":"00492760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035171S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"55","articleId":"492760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492781,"authors":[{"name":"F.N.

The conventional feedback power control algorithms allow the base station to send a power command to raise/lower each user transmitting signal power level by a fixed power step and then keep the received powers almost equal. The fixed-step approach is actually an integral control whose power increment is determined according to the bang-bang-like control policy. However, this control scheme suffers from several disadvantages. To tackle these difficulties, a fuzzy proportional-plus-integral (PI) control, whose input variables are the received power error and error change, is introduced to determine each user's transmitting power in order to maintain simultaneously all users' signal power received at the base station nearly equal and to achieve better system stability and control performance. The derivation of the fuzzy PI control has been carried out by analyzing both the closed-loop steady state behavior and transient response of the system with a priori knowledge of the dynamics of the CDMA mobile fading channels. In fuzzy control, linguistic descriptions of actions in controlling a process are represented as fuzzy rules. This fuzzy-rule base is used by an inference mechanism in conjunction with some knowledge of the states of process in order to determine control actions. These actions would lead to the fast rise time, minimum overshoot, and small root-mean-squared (rms) tracking error. Additional advantages of fuzzy PI control over conventional control theories are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/25.492846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/10610/00492846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.492846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10610","startPage":"225","endPage":"236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy power control for CDMA mobile radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy power control for CDMA mobile radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277258","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fuzzy power control for CDMA mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"00492846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054234S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"57","articleId":"492846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492847,"authors":[{"name":"Y.A.

In the first scheme of distributed decisions combining, the combiner collects only the binary branch decisions to make the data decision. In the second scheme, the combiner makes the data decision using the branch decisions and the channel states. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical diversity branches are considered. Based on optimal likelihood ratio testing, a new data decision rule is devised for the detection of the spread-spectrum signals in the DS-CDMA system. Upper bounds are employed for the performance evaluation of the diversity combining schemes when the bit error probability is difficult to compute.

The same signal is simulcast by each antenna in the cell. The signals at a given cell could be multiplexed and modulated for radio transmission at a single node, then transmitted on a coaxial cable distribution system to and from the distributed antennas in a cell. Frequency translation and radio frequency (RF) amplification may need to be performed at each antenna, except for indoor applications with short coaxial cables. This paper presents calculations of signal-to-interference ratios (SIR) and handoff performance for cells with distributed antennas. It is shown that the use of distributed antennas can substantially increase the SIR above a system with a single antenna per cell, and this increase is quantified. It is also shown that increasing the number of antennas results in better overall handoff performance, with a lower number of handoffs and higher received signal power. Minimizing the number of handoffs will reduce the impact of wireless services on network elements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/10610/00492850.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.492850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.492850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A radio access system with distributed antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coaxial cables","Personal communication networks","Hybrid fiber coaxial cables","Digital audio broadcasting","Transmitting antennas","Radio frequency","Receiving antennas","Frequency conversion","Signal processing","Optical fiber cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","subscriber loops","multiplexing","modulation","antennas","coaxial cables","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially distributed antennas","radio access system","multiplexing","modulation","radio transmission","coaxial cable distribution system","frequency translation","radio frequency amplification","RF amplification","indoor applications","short coaxial cables","signal-to-interference ratios","handoff performance","SIR","received signal power","wireless services","network elements","cellular radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"A radio access system with distributed antennas","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A radio access system with distributed antennas","sourcePdf":"00492850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043197S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"88","articleId":"492850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":492851,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The optimum multiuser detector is too complex to be implemented at present. Four suboptimum detection techniques based on zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) equalization with and without decision feedback (DF) are presented and compared. They combat both ISI and MAI. The computational complexity of all four equalizers is essentially the same. All four equalizers are independent of the size of the data symbol alphabet. It is shown that the performance of the MMSE equalizers is better than that of the corresponding ZF equalizers. Furthermore, the performance of the equalizers with DF is better than that of the corresponding equalizers without DF. The impairing effect of error propagation on the equalizers with DF is reduced by channel sorting.","doi":"10.1109/25.492851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/10610/00492851.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.492851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero forcing and minimum mean-square-error equalization for multiuser detection in code-division multiple-access channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Zero forcing and minimum mean-square-error equalization for multiuser detection in code-division multiple-access channels","volume":"45","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5277263","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492851/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero forcing and minimum mean-square-error equalization for multiuser detection in code-division multiple-access channels","sourcePdf":"00492851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06958S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"388","articleId":"492851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":492852,"authors":[{"name":"N.

As a consequence, the sampling rate of servo systems has been becoming lower. In this situation, it is difficult to attain fast track seeking by using only a feedback controller. This paper presents a high-speed track seek technique, based on two degree-of-freedom control. A new reference model is developed by focusing on the attainment of fast track seeking through the effective use of a voice coil motor, which functions as a disk head actuator. The model generates reference trajectories, allowing high-speed movement. Also, in order to quickly settle the disk head to a target track under various disturbances, an initial value compensation (IVC) method to minimize a quadratic performance index is developed. Experimental results, using a 3-1/2 inch hard disk drive, confirm the validity of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Sampling methods","Servomechanisms","Velocity control","Adaptive control","Target tracking","Feedforward systems","Hard disks","Coils","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard discs","magnetic heads","position control","servomechanisms","magnetic recording","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["head positioning","low sampling rate system","two degree-of-freedom control","formatting efficiency","high density hard disk drive","embedded servo signal","high-speed track seeking","reference model","voice coil motor","actuator","initial value compensation","quadratic performance index","3.5 inch"]}],"doi":"10.1109/20.492866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/10598/00492866.pdf","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.492866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Head positioning control for low sampling rate systems based on two degree-of-freedom control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Head positioning control for low sampling rate systems based on two degree-of-freedom control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492866/","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5277216","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Head positioning control for low sampling rate systems based on two degree-of-freedom control","sourcePdf":"00492866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036253S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"43","articleId":"492866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":492876,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The relative magnetic permeability and loss factor were determined near and above natural gyromagnetic resonance using H/sub 011/ cylindrical dielectric ring resonators.

Generally, the real part of the complex magnetic permeability increases with decreasing saturation magnetization, while the magnetic loss factor increases nonlinearly with increasing saturation.

The data allow design optimization of circulators and dual-mode and polarization-insensitive phasers, which are widely used in antenna array systems.","doi":"10.1109/20.492888","startPage":"1924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/10598/00492888.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.492888","endPage":"1933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex permeability of demagnetized microwave ferrites near and above gyromagnetic resonance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Complex permeability of demagnetized microwave ferrites near and above gyromagnetic resonance","volume":"32","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5277237","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex permeability of demagnetized microwave ferrites near and above gyromagnetic resonance","sourcePdf":"00492888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059178S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"50","articleId":"492888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":492889,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We develop a new method for the computation of the BER: we show that errors occur if the phasors of the instantaneous impulse response fall into certain regions of the complex plane; then we average over the statistics of the phasors to arrive at the mean BER. With this method, we derive analytical expressions for the BER for arbitrary amplitude statistics of the paths. For the special case of two Rayleigh-fading paths with small delay, we find that the BER is proportional to the square of the mean delay spread (normalized to the bit length) if we sample between the two pulses. This proves the qualitative behavior of previous estimates, but our results allow also a more exact quantitative formulation. The quadratic dependence of the BER on the delay spread breaks down if we have one Rayleigh-fading and one Rician-fading path. We find that the bit combinations 1-11 and -11-1 do not lead to errors in the two-path model. However, additional Monte Carlo simulations show that these bit combinations do lead to errors in a three-path model.","doi":"10.1109/25.492904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.492904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/10610/00492904.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error floor of MSK modulation in a mobile-radio channel with two independently fading paths","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Error floor of MSK modulation in a mobile-radio channel with two independently fading paths","volume":"45","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277265","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error floor of MSK modulation in a mobile-radio channel with two independently fading paths","sourcePdf":"00492904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026979S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","articleId":"492904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":492905,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In all, four completely different methods for the computation of the coefficients of the simulation model are introduced. Furthermore, the performance of each procedure is investigated on the basis of two quality criteria. All the presented methods have in common the fact that the resulting simulation model has a completely determined fading behavior for all time.

Determination of the outage probability in a Nakagami (1960) mobile environment is particularly important since Nakagami fading is, as shown by various empirical measurements, the most appropriate model in many practical applications. Effective techniques have been developed recently to determine outage probability in the presence of multiple Nakagami interferers by assuming that the fading parameters of both signal and co-channel interferences are integer-valued. However, the general problem with arbitrary Nakagami signal and interferers remains unsolved. A new technique is presented, which allows the Nakagami distributions for both signal and interferers to be arbitrary. Exact formulas for probability of outage with and without a constraint on minimum signal power are derived, and computer results are also presented to illustrate the theory.","doi":"10.1109/25.492911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/10610/00492911.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.492911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probability in cellular mobile radio due to Nakagami signal and interferers with arbitrary parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=492911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492911/","displayDocTitle":"Outage probability in cellular mobile radio due to Nakagami signal and interferers with arbitrary parameters","volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277272","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probability in cellular mobile radio due to Nakagami signal and interferers with arbitrary parameters","sourcePdf":"00492911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06074S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"78","articleId":"492911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492912,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Deterministic path loss, log-normal shadowing, and Ricean fading are accounted for, and the use of diversity and power control is considered in order to enhance system performance. Both hexagonal and lineal cells are considered. Particular attention is given to the sensitivity of the outage probability to the system parameters, especially those related to the propagation model (fading, shadowing, and path loss). It is seen that diversity and power control can improve the system behavior. The performance is sensitive to the fading parameter (i.e., the Rice factor) of the intended user, but is relatively independent of that of the interferers. Also, a significant dependence is observed on the shadowing parameter, whereas a limited dependence is seen on the outage threshold and the channel utilization.

A small error in his paper, however, has led to an inexact picture. We correct that inaccuracy. As a consequence, the loss in capacity of a Rayleigh fading channel with respect to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel turns out to be negligible for all values of the signal-to-noise ratio that are of interest. Furthermore, we extend the analytical results to the situation with M-branch diversity and Ricean fading channels. The lower moments of the associated distributions, i.e., of the /spl chi//sup 2/-distribution (Nakagami with integer m-parameter) and Rice distribution agree when the parameters of the distribution are suitably chosen. With that choice of parameters, the capacities of the M-branch diversity and of the Ricean fading channel become almost identical.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/492915/","volume":"45","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5277276","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comment on \"Estimate of channel capacity in Rayleigh fading environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comment on \"Estimate of channel capacity in Rayleigh fading environment","sourcePdf":"00492915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051212S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"84","articleId":"492915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":492967,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Previous studies have shown that wavelength translation can improve the blocking performance of these networks. However, all the previous work has assumed that wavelength translators can translate from any input wavelength to any output wavelength. In contrast, all-optical wavelength translators demonstrated in the laboratory to date are, in general, only capable of limited translation. We assess, for the first time, the network performance improvements offered by realistic all-optical wavelength translators with a limited translation range. In particular, we consider all-optical wavelength translators based on four-wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers. Using a simple model for their function, we consider the blocking performance of two-hop and multiple-hop paths, and unidirectional ring and mesh-torus networks. In all the cases we consider, significant improvement in the blocking performance of the network is obtained when limited-range wavelength translators with as little as one quarter of the full range an introduced. We also find that almost all of the network performance improvement observed by an ideal wavelength translator can be gained from a translator with only half of the full translation range.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited-range wavelength translation in all-optical networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

Sometimes, data demands will exceed the system capacity, in which case the system must make the most efficient use of its limited resources. The resources we consider are: fixed bandwidth available for each user and the transmit power budget for each cell. We present our approach for unifying power control, variable forward error correction (VFEC), and scheduling for allocating the system resources. Our objective is to maximize the overall system satisfaction, which we call \"system utility\". This objective is achieved by applying a distributed algorithm which divides the overall optimization problem into a hierarchy of three levels (system, cell and user). At each level, the system performs independent and parallel optimizations; the critical information is then passed to the higher level for further optimization. Finally, an iterative and distributed algorithm is applied at the system level to achieve the overall system optimization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified power control, error correction coding and scheduling for a CDMA downlink system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

Most wireless LAN link layer protocols recover from packet losses by retransmitting lost segments. When the wireless channel is in a burst error state, most retransmission attempts fail thereby causing poor utilization of the wireless channel. Furthermore, in the event of multiple sessions sharing a wireless link, FIFO packet scheduling can cause the HOL blocking effect, resulting in unfair sharing of the bandwidth. This observation leads to a new class of packet dispatching methods which explicitly take the wireless channel characteristics into consideration in making packet dispatching decisions. We compare a variety of channel state dependent packet (CSDP) scheduling methods with a view towards enhancing the performance of the transport layer sessions. Our results indicate that by employing a CSDP scheduler at the wireless LAN device driver level, significant improvement in the channel utilization can be achieved in typical wireless LAN configurations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

RMTP provides sequenced, lossless delivery of bulk data from one sender to a group of receivers. RMTP achieves reliability by using a packet-based selective repeat retransmission scheme, in which each acknowledgment (ACK) packet carries a sequence number and a bitmap. ACK handling is based on a multi-level hierarchical approach, in which the receivers are grouped into a hierarchy of local regions, with a designated receiver (DR) in each local region. Receivers in each local region periodically send ACKs to their corresponding DR, DRs send ACKs to the higher-level DRs, until the DRs in the highest level send ACKs to the sender, thereby avoiding the ACK-implosion problem. DRs cache received data and respond to retransmission requests of the receivers in their corresponding local regions, thereby decreasing end-to-end latency and improving resource usage. This paper also provides the measurements of RMTP's performance with receivers located at various sites in the Internet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Mar 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5341623","conferenceDate":"24-28 March 1996","displayDocTitle":"RMTP: a reliable multicast transport protocol","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RMTP: a reliable multicast transport protocol","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00493090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032504S","chronDate":"24-28 Mar 1996","isNumber":"10630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3539","citationCount":"189","articleId":"493090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":493091,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To achieve scalability, the number of receivers sending feedback in case of loss must remain small. However, losses experienced by different receivers are strongly correlated, since they share resources in the multicast tree. We present DTRM (deterministic timeouts for reliable multicast), a distributed algorithm to compute optimal deterministic timeouts for each receiver in a multicast tree as a function of the tree topology and sender-to-receiver delays. DTRM has several desirable properties. First, the computation of the timeouts is entirely distributed; receivers and intermediate nodes only rely on local topology information. Second, NACK implosion is provably avoided for a single loss anywhere in the tree if delay jitter is bounded. Third, feedback information does not need to be processed by intermediate nodes, and receivers do not have to collaborate. We foresee two possible uses for DTRM. In networks providing hard delay bounds, timeouts can be computed once at session set-up time. In networks with unbounded delays, such as the Internet, timeouts can be adaptively recomputed in response to changes in estimated round-trip times.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1996.493091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10630","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1432 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

Initially described in IETF RFC 1458 (1993), RAMP has been enhanced for use over an all-optical, circuit-switched, gigabit network under our ARPA-sponsored testbed for optical networking (TBONE) project. RAMP uses immediate, receiver-initiated, NAK-based, unicast error notification combined with originator based unicast retransmission. The approach is motivated by the loss characteristics of the TBONE network, where extremely low bit-error rates (10/sup -12/ or better) and the absence of any store-and-forward capabilities in the switches make packet losses almost entirely a result of receiver buffer overflows. As receiver losses are largely independent, use of unicast over multicast for NAKs and retransmission eliminates unnecessary receiver processing overhead associated with reading and discarding redundant packets. Use of immediate rather than delayed NAKs further improves performance by reducing both latency and the likelihood of buffer overflow. The effectiveness of this combined error control approach has been verified by other researchers, as well as through our own investigations. Interestingly, TBONE loss characteristics resemble those of switched virtual circuit ATM networks and packet-switched networks employing reservation services. As these networks provide quality of service guarantees in the switches, the likely source of packet loss is again due to receiver errors and buffer overflows. Hence, RAMP's design is also relevant for the next generation of packet switched networks.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.493093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1996.493093","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1451 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

A versatile platform of development allows for many variations and applications including mobility assist for the paralyzed, amputee, and spastic patient (MAPAS). A variety of strap on supports and braces are used, depending on the magnitude of the forces required. The MAPAS system utilizes compressed gas to power the main force producing elements, or muscles. Pneumatic muscles are used to provide controllable joint torque with moderate levels of pressure. These muscles are mounted to the brace, providing pull-only torque to joints. The MAPAS control system features interpreted joint mapping. The function of each leg joint is primarily directed through the output of a finger joint sensor. A six to eight sensor hand goniometer provides the system with user input. Higher control features actuated by on-board intelligent devices enable finger joint inputs to be enhanced providing balance, gait anticipation, fault-recovery, and spasm signature compensation. Ambient pressure levels of on-board reservoirs can be changed to suit changing environments ranging from heavily loaded amputee walking up stairs to the slight correction of a mild spasm.

With this basic approach, also known as Quadro or switched fiber delay lines (SDL), the solution efficiency is linked to its storage capacity, determined by the combined length of the fiber delay lines. In the past, this capacity was given by the number of 2/spl times/2 photonic switches used, i.e., the number of stages in the receiver, which limited the solution by cost, mainly determined by the switch component, and by the signal power loss and crosstalk introduced by each switch. This work presents and analyzes the use of \"multibuffer\" fiber delay lines, in Quadro, so termed since in it multiple packets are allowed to be concurrently stored (propagated) on each delay line. In this way the total storage capacity is increased, while the proposed design utilizing novel switch control is shown to significantly improve receiver and network performance, without increasing the number of the 6/spl times/2 space photonic switches in the system, i.e., its cost.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.493307","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

Research is now focusing on third generation systems. These are generally referred to as personal communications networks (PCN), universal mobile telecommunication systems (UMTS) or future public land mobile telecommunication systems (FPLMTS). Different modulation schemes supporting multiple data rates in a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS/CDMA) system are studied. A successive multistage interference cancellation scheme for the considered modulations is described. Bit error probability on both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels are presented both with single user detection and with multistage interference cancellation.

A variety of graph models are found in the literature, including regular topologies such as rings or stars, \"well-known\" topologies such as the original ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. Less common is any discussion of how closely these models correlate with real network topologies. We consider the problem of efficiently generating graph models that accurately reflect the topological properties of real internetworks. We compare the properties of graphs generated using various methods with those of real internets. We also propose efficient methods for generating topologies with particular properties, including a transit-stub model that correlates well with the internet structure. Improved models for the internetwork structure have the potential to impact the significance of simulation studies of internetworking solutions, providing a basis for the validity of the conclusions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Mar 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493353/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5341528","conferenceDate":"24-28 March 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"How to model an internetwork","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to model an internetwork","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00493353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028671S","chronDate":"24-28 Mar 1996","isNumber":"10629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3539","citationCount":"652","articleId":"493353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":493355,"authors":[{"name":"S.

High-speed links, coupled with small packet/cell sizes, require efficient switch architectures that can handle cell arrivals and departures every few microseconds, or faster. This paper presents a collection of self-clocked fair queueing (SCFQ) architectures amenable to efficient hardware implementation in network switches. Exact and approximate implementations of SCFQ efficiently handle a moderate range of connection bandwidth parameters, while hierarchical arbitration schemes scale to a large range of throughput requirements. Simulation experiments demonstrate that these architectures divide link bandwidth fairly on a small time scale, preserving connection bandwidth and burstiness properties.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1996.493359","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.493359","startPage":"638","endPage":"646 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel2/3539/10629/00493359.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

We propose and study multi-code CDMA (MC-CDMA) with distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA) for multi-rate wireless packet networks. The network incorporates MC-CDMA (a flexible multiplexing scheme for providing multi-rate packet transmissions) and DQRUMA (an efficient demand-assignment multiple access protocol for wireless access and scheduling) to form a unified bandwidth-on-demand fair-sharing platform for multi-rate wireless services. A slot-by-slot packet transmit scheduling policy provides the possibility of slot-by-slot allocation of pseudo-noise (PN) codes (primary codes) and optimal power levels to the mobiles involved in packet transmissions. Also, a maximum capacity power allocation (MCPA) criterion is derived to exploit the subcode concatenation property of the MC-CDMA transmission. Simulation results show that the system provides close to ideal-access performance for multi-rate mobiles, both with homogeneous traffic characteristics and with a mix of heterogeneous traffic characteristics.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

The methods are applicable to very general models that allow heterogeneous traffic sources and finite buffers. A feedforward neural network (NN) is used to predict whether or not accepting a requested new call would result in a feasible aggregate scream, i.e., one that satisfies the QOS requirements. The NN input vector is a traffic descriptor for the aggregate stream that has the following beneficial properties: its dimension is independent of the number of traffic classes; and it is additive, allowing it to be updated efficiently by simply adding the traffic descriptor of the new call. A novel asymmetric error function for the NN helps achieve our asymmetric objective in which rejecting an infeasible stream is more important than accepting a feasible one. We present a NN design that provides an optimal linear compression of the NN inputs to a smaller number of traffic parameters. The special case of one compressed parameter corresponds to an NN version of the equivalent bandwidth. Experiments show our methods to be better than methods based on the equivalent bandwidth, with respect to call blocking probability and the percentage of feasible streams that an correctly classified.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.493374","pdfPath":"/iel2/3539/10629/00493374.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"776 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

Many existing program understanding tools build control flow and data flow representations of the program a priori, and therefore may require prohibitive space and time when analyzing large systems. Since much of these representations may be unused during an analysis, we construct representations on demand, not in advance. Furthermore, some representations, such as the abstract syntax tree, may be used infrequently during an analysis. We discard these representations and recompute them as needed, reducing the overall space required. Finally, we permit the user to selectively trade off time for precision and to customize the termination of these costly analyses in order to provide finer user control. We revised the traditional software architecture for compilers to provide these features without unnecessarily complicating the analyses themselves. These techniques have been successfully applied in the design of a program slicer for the Comprehensive Health Care System (CHCS), a million line hospital management system written in the MUMPS programming language.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1996.493398","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1996.493398","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 18th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/3540/10631/00493398.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 18th International Conference on Software Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of whole-program analysis tools","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The design of whole-program analysis tools","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Mar 1996","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5268253","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of whole-program analysis tools","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"00493398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06252S","chronDate":"25-29 Mar 1996","isNumber":"10631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3540","citationCount":"33","articleId":"493398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":493413,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To date most work has focused upon algorithmic cost models such as COCOMO and Function Points. These can suffer from the disadvantage of the need to calibrate the model to each individual measurement environment coupled with very variable accuracy levels even after calibration. An alternative approach is to use analogy for estimation. We demonstrate that this method has considerable promise in that we show it to out perform traditional algorithmic methods for six different datasets. A disadvantage of estimation by analogy is that it requires a considerable amount of computation. The paper describes an automated environment known as ANGEL that supports the collection, storage and identification of the most analogous projects in order to estimate the effort for a new project. ANGEL is based upon the minimisation of Euclidean distance in n-dimensional space. The software is flexible and can deal with differing datasets both in terms of the number of observations (projects) and in the variables collected. Our analogy approach is evaluated with six distinct datasets drawn from a range of different environments and is found to outperform other methods. It is widely accepted that effective software effort estimation demands more than one technique. We have shown that estimating by analogy is a candidate technique and that with the aid of an automated environment is an eminently practical technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Mar 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493413/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5268268","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Effort estimation using analogy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effort estimation using analogy","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"00493413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051465S","chronDate":"25-29 Mar 1996","isNumber":"10631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3540","citationCount":"104","articleId":"493413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":493457,"authors":[{"name":"T.R.

The practical solution of the prediction problem is strongly related with the availability of suitable representations of multidimensional mappings. The proposed technique, belonging to the memory-based techniques, highly reduces the memory amount required to store the representation of the mapping. The iterative technique is very well suited to work in conjunction with an associative memory structure as the monodimensional CMAC and in presence of on-fly data.

The first subsystem reduces the image size in the spatial domain and the second subsystem reduces the image size in the frequency domain. These two successive compression processes combine to form a powerful image compression. The overall compression rate of images in this technique can reach up to about 97% of their original size without losing the image quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 28th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3544/10635/00493521.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"321","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 28th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1996.493521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1996.493521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=493521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new subband coding technique using (JPEG) discrete cosine transform for image compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Transform coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Signal synthesis","Discrete Fourier transforms","Discrete transforms","Signal analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Amplitude modulation","Filter bank"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","video signal processing","data compression","filtering theory","discrete cosine transforms","frequency-domain analysis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband image coding","JPEG","discrete cosine transform","image compression","2-D single-sideband","down-sampling","up-sampling","filter banks","Joint Photographic Experts Group","spatial domain","frequency domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Mar-2 Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"A new subband coding technique using (JPEG) discrete cosine transform for image compression","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5274546","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new subband coding technique using (JPEG) discrete cosine transform for image compression","confLoc":"Baton Rouge, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00493521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02649S","chronDate":"31 Mar-2 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3544","citationCount":"2","articleId":"493521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":493527,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is presented for generating a sequence of input vectors that tend to continuously maximize the switching activity of the circuit and hence the maximum power dissipated. The GA used evolves candidate input vectors while making use of a logic simulator to compute the fitness of each candidate. Experimentation with different GA parameters was carried out in order to derive an optimal set of working parameters for the GA. The performance of the GA technique was evaluated using \"test circuits\" whose topology allows simple analysis to determine the maximum number of simultaneous transitions possible for the circuits. In addition to this, some circuits from the ISAC-85 benchmark suite of circuits were also tested. The GA method was found to significantly out perform simulation-based techniques, especially in terms of CPU time expenditures.","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1996.493527","pdfPath":"/iel2/3544/10635/00493527.pdf","startPage":"348","endPage":"352","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 28th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 28th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1996.493527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for estimating maximum power dissipation in CMOS combinational circuits using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Mar-2 Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"A framework for estimating maximum power dissipation in CMOS combinational circuits using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5274552","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for estimating maximum power dissipation in CMOS combinational circuits using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Baton Rouge, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00493527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048778S","chronDate":"31 Mar-2 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3544","citationCount":"2","articleId":"493527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":493580,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The current-time (or voltage-time) characteristics of the constant stress are investigated and it is observed that charge trapping in the oxide is the reason for the time to breakdown increase. The pre-stressed oxide clearly shows a different initial charge trapping characteristic than the non prestressed oxide. The measurement results are discussed and it is demonstrated that the common understanding of oxide breakdown cannot explain the observed results. Therefore, a new parameter is proposed which is related to oxide degradation and breakdown and which has to be considered in combined ramped/constant stress measurements.","doi":"10.1109/IRWS.1995.493580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRWS.1995.493580","startPage":"81","endPage":"91","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1995 International Integrated Reliability Workshop.

Certain error-correcting codes can be employed to specify a minimal subset of nodes called \"stations\" which are at distance t from the rest of the nodes. The stations, acting as relay agents, can then broadcast data/control information from central controller to all nodes (or conversely from the nodes to central controller) in no more than t steps.

Despite its computational efficiency, independent component processing is seldom able to exploit the full RGB gamut. While joint processing of color components can generally utilize the full display gamut, such approaches generally produce greater computational complexity and execution times. The authors introduced the \"histogram decimation\" algorithm for enhancement by joint processing of the color components. The algorithm recursively partitions the 3-D histogram of an image and independently processes the subdivided volumes of color space to modify their color distributions. Histogram decimation achieves the gamut usage of other joint processing techniques and provides much greater computational efficiency. The algorithm and its characteristics are presented, followed by the results of processing several images and measuring the uniformity of their histograms using a novel technique.","doi":"10.1109/IAI.1996.493756","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation","pdfPath":"/iel2/3545/10636/00493756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAI.1996.493756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10636","startPage":"218","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A recursive technique for 3-D histogram enhancement of color images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=493756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A recursive technique for 3-D histogram enhancement of color images","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493756/","conferenceDate":"8-9 April 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5316624","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recursive technique for 3-D histogram enhancement of color images","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00493756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035686S","chronDate":"8-9 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3545","citationCount":"12","articleId":"493756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":493766,"authors":[{"name":"K.

First, these synthetic retinae are morphologically equivalent to their biological counterparts-at an appropriate level of abstraction. Second, they accomplish all four major operations performed by biological retinae using neurobiological principles: (1) continuous sensing for detection, (2) local automatic gain control for amplification, (3) spatiotemporal bandpass filtering for preprocessing, and (4) adaptive sampling for quantization. The author introduces the term retinomorphic to refer to this subclass of the neuromorphic electronic systems. Their design principles are compared and contrasted with the standard practice in imager design. It is argued that neurobiological principles are best suited to perceptive systems that go beyond reproducing the dynamic scene, like a conventional video camera does, to extracting salient information in real time. The results from a fully operational retinomorphic vision system are presented and the trade-offs involved in its design are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MNNFS.1996.493766","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Fifth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Fifth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/3550/10641/00493766.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNNFS.1996.493766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retinomorphic vision systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=493766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493766/","displayDocTitle":"Retinomorphic vision systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5297112","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retinomorphic vision systems","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00493766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044065S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb 1996","isNumber":"10641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3550","citationCount":"34","articleId":"493766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":493767,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We are also able to estimate the number of bits needed to solve any classification problem for the general case. Being interested in the VLSI implementation of such networks, the optimum criteria are not only the classical size and depth, but also the connectivity and the number of bits for representing the weights-as such measures are closer estimates of the area and lead to better approximations of the AT/sup 2/.","doi":"10.1109/MNNFS.1996.493800","startPage":"257","endPage":"264","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Fifth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/3550/10641/00493800.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Fifth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNNFS.1996.493800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct synthesis of neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network synthesis","Neural networks","Neurons","Very large scale integration","Area measurement","Entropy","Mathematics","Educational institutions","Encoding","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","VLSI","entropy","neural chips","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct synthesis","neural networks","VLSI","constructive algorithm","classification problem","XOR-like problems","entropy","connectivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb 1996","displayDocTitle":"Direct synthesis of neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 1996","accessionNumber":"5297146","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct synthesis of neural networks","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00493800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088424S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb 1996","isNumber":"10641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3550","citationCount":"5","articleId":"493800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":493801,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This model is based essentially on replacing the standard Gaussian basis function with a piece-wise linear one and on using a fast allocation unit learning algorithm for determination of unit centers.

The learning algorithm is fully on-line and easy to be implemented in VLSI using the proposed neural structures for on-line signal processing tasks. Applying the standard test problem of the chaotic time series prediction, the functional performances of different RBF networks were compared. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the standard RBF networks, the main advantages being related with low hardware requirements and fast learning while the learning algorithm can be also efficient embedded in silicon.

The point of this note is that fuzzy logic plays a pivotal role in CW and vice-versa. Thus, as an approximation, fuzzy logic may be equated to CW. There are two major imperatives for computing with words. First, computing with words is a necessity when the available information is too imprecise to justify the use of numbers, and second, when there is a tolerance for imprecision which can be exploited to achieve tractability, robustness, low solution cost, and better rapport with reality. Exploitation of the tolerance for imprecision is an issue of central importance in CW. In CW, a word is viewed as a label of a granule; that is, a fuzzy set of points drawn together by similarity, with the fuzzy set playing the role of a fuzzy constraint on a variable. The premises are assumed to be expressed as propositions in a natural language. In coming years, computing with words is likely to evolve into a basic methodology in its own right with wide-ranging ramifications on both basic and applied levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5279376","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic = computing with words","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic = computing with words","sourcePdf":"00493904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1738S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"2094","articleId":"493904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":493911,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The experimental results are validated by data obtained using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique.","doi":"10.1109/22.493924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/10656/00493924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.493924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10656","startPage":"711","endPage":"716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of coplanar stripline discontinuities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=493924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of coplanar stripline discontinuities","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493924/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277082","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of coplanar stripline discontinuities","sourcePdf":"00493924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048653S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"47","articleId":"493924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":493928,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

The DA combines a 100 GHz fmax and 60 GHz fT HBT technology with a cascode coplanar waveguide DA topology to achieve this record bandwidth. The cascode gain cell offers 5-7 dB more available gain (MAG) than a common-emitter, and is used to extend the amplifier's upper frequency performance. A coplanar waveguide design environment is used to simplify the modeling and fabrication, as well as to reduce the size of the amplifier. Novel active load terminations for extending the DA's lower frequency response were separately demonstrated. The active loads are capable of extending the lower bandwidth performance by two decades resulting in performance below 45 MHz. This work explores both design techniques and technology capability which can be applied to other distributively matched HBT circuits such as active baluns for mixers, active combiners/dividers, and low DC power-broadband amplifiers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Coplanar waveguides","Distributed amplifiers","Performance gain","Topology","Optical device fabrication","Frequency response","Circuits","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indium compounds","aluminium compounds","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","heterojunction bipolar transistors","distributed amplifiers","wideband amplifiers","coplanar waveguides","MMIC amplifiers","bipolar MMIC","frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth performance","heterojunction bipolar transistor","HBT-based distributed amplifiers","CPW distributed amplifier","cascode CPW amplifier topology","cascode gain cell","CPW design environment","active load terminations","frequency response","coplanar waveguide","SHF","MMIC","broadband amplifier","2 to 30 GHz","60 GHz","100 GHz","28 GHz","InAlAs-InGaAs-InP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.493928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/10656/00493928.pdf","startPage":"739","endPage":"748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.493928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending the bandwidth performance of heterojunction bipolar transistor-based distributed amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=493928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extending the bandwidth performance of heterojunction bipolar transistor-based distributed amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/493928/","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5277086","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending the bandwidth performance of heterojunction bipolar transistor-based distributed amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00493928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051468S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"23","articleId":"493928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":493954,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper presents solutions for the most notorious problems during etching HARTs: tilting and the aspect ratio dependent etching effects such as bowing, RIE lag, bottling, and micrograss or black silicon. To handle these problems submicron HARTs are etched and the black silicon method is used to direct the pressure, power, ion energy, or flows of a fluorine-based RIE into the preferred settings. The influence of ion energy and trajectory is found to be most critical. The behaviour of the HART process is explained with the help of a set of variables and used to optimise the final profile. After this optimisation the RIE setting found is used for etching supermicron HART's which are characteristic for MEMS applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.1996.493989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10653","startPage":"250","endPage":"257","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Ninth International Workshop on Micro Electromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3559/10653/00493989.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The black silicon method.

The micro mixer has been designed as an integrated part of a micromachined chemical analysis system. The fabrication technology is based on wet chemical etching of PYREX-glass and silicon substrates which are subsequently bonded anodically. The micro mixer is designed to work in the flow range 1-10 /spl mu/l/min with a Reynolds number less than 1 and an undisturbed laminal flow pattern. Comprehensive theoretical studies and computer simulations have been carried out in order to understand the detailed flow behaviour and diffusion in the mixer, and to set up design criteria needed to obtain perfect or near perfect multi-layer lamination. As a result of the study of a generic type of micro mixer and flow simulations, the need of a \"separation plate\" inside each mixer stage is revealed. The performance of micro machined single stage mixers has been verified by mixing experiments using the fast reaction of phenol-red and an acid. The experimental set-up takes advantage of the transparent PYREX-glass plate offering the possibility to study mixing phenomena by video microscopy.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1996.494022","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Ninth International Workshop on Micro Electromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Ninth International Workshop on Micro Electromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3559/10653/00494022.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.1996.494022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10653","startPage":"441","endPage":"446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast mixing by lamination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=494022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast mixing by lamination","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494022/","conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5316272","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast mixing by lamination","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00494022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043904S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb 1996","isNumber":"10653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3559","citationCount":"73","articleId":"494022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":494041,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Bird vocalizations and human speech are generated by similar processes. This suggests that LPC coefficients extracted from birdsong samples could retain enough information to permit identification of species. In this paper we train a back-propagation neural network to recognize bird songs. We generated test and training data sets using 133 songs from six common bird species. Initially, identification performance was good for some species, and poor for others. We attributed this to a lack of temporal context information in the data. By changing the type of spectral information presented to the network, we were able to improve performance. We conclude that a neural network combined with digital preprocessing can be used to identify a bird by its song.","doi":"10.1109/WESCAN.1995.494065","startPage":"409","endPage":"414 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE WESCANEX 95.

The fingerprinting system consists of the application of multiresolution wavelet analysis used to characterize the features contained in the transient followed by the use of a genetic algorithm to extract the wavelet coefficients that represent critical features of the transient. To measure the ability of the system to generate efficient and unique fingerprints, a neural network is used to classify the transients by their fingerprints. To test the noise sensitivity of the system, noisy transients were applied to a trained neural network, the network was able to positively classify noisy transients with 20 dB signal to noise ratios (SNR) and up. Experiments with real radio transients show that the system is able generate uniqiue fingerprints for absolute classification by a neural network for radios of differing model type as well as radios of the same model type.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5317024","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transient analysis and genetic algorithms for classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient analysis and genetic algorithms for classification","confLoc":"Winnipeg, MB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00494069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024802S","chronDate":"15-16 May 1995","isNumber":"10821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3680","citationCount":"44","articleId":"494069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":494071,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This measure is defined as the probability to achieve totally self-checking (TSC) goal at the lth cycle: TSCG(t). TSCG provides insight to the worst case dynamic behavior of SC circuits with respect to the application environment and component failure rates. TSCG surpasses the TSC definitions in determining the applicability of a circuit in a given application environment. An SC circuit achieves TSC goal when no erroneous information or data is propagated beyond the boundary of this circuit. TSCG is therefore the probability that this fault confinement mechanism is intact. The SC properties are obtained through adding hardware redundancy to the original digital design, which means that an SC circuit has a higher failure rate than the original circuit. Further, there are tradeoffs between the level of hardware redundancy, the reliability, and the TSCG. We give several examples to clearly demonstrate these tradeoffs for different design environments. We emphasize that the TSCG is intended to provide a mean of dynamic error handling performance evaluation of SC designs. The TSC definitions and alike are still intact, since a cost-effective SC circuit must begin with a TSC circuit. The TSCG gives confidence in the use of cost-efficient error control codes and/or reduction in error handling capability. Analogous to reliability, the TSCG can be used in product specifications. This is a crucial step toward the practical applications of TSC or CED circuits.","doi":"10.1109/12.494102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/10659/00494102.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.494102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probability to achieve TSC goal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Probability to achieve TSC goal","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5277166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability to achieve TSC goal","sourcePdf":"00494102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032259S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"19","articleId":"494102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":494103,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

Unidirectional errors have been observed in modern digital devices such as PLAs, ROMs, and compact laser disks. In this paper, a new approach to designing self-testing checkers (STCs) for Borden codes is proposed. The new STC is built of a self-testing code-disjoint translator of the Borden code into the 1-out-of-z code (z/spl ges/2) and if z=3 or 4 an STC for the 1-out-of-n code. The translator is built of two multi-output threshold circuits with [n/2] and [n/2] inputs and a merging network. Compared to existing STCs for Borden codes the new checker generally uses significantly less hardware. It also enjoys a modular and highly regular structure which makes it attractive for VLSI implementation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/10659/00494103.pdf","doi":"10.1109/12.494103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.494103","startPage":"461","endPage":"469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of self-testing checkers for Borden codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494103/","displayDocTitle":"Design of self-testing checkers for Borden codes","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5277167","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of self-testing checkers for Borden codes","sourcePdf":"00494103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029258S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","articleId":"494103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":494105,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Embedding binary trees into another network-the host network-helps in designing solutions for the host network using the known solutions on binary trees. Embedding arbitrary binary trees into networks, in particular into the hypercube, has been addressed in the literature. The latter was achieved with load 1 and constant dilation. The n-star graph is a recently introduced interconnection network for massively parallel systems. It enjoys symmetry and fault tolerance properties that make it a viable alternative to the hypercube. In this paper, we address the problem of embedding arbitrary binary trees into the n-star graph. This work is the first to present such an embedding. The tree has [e(n-1)1] or fewer vertices. The embedding leads to load 1 and constant dilation for all values of n. It therefore enables the star graph to efficiently simulate an arbitrary binary tree with only a constant factor of communication delay.","doi":"10.1109/12.494105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/10659/00494105.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.494105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedding an arbitrary binary tree into the star graph","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=494105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494105/","displayDocTitle":"Embedding an arbitrary binary tree into the star graph","volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1996","accessionNumber":"5277169","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedding an arbitrary binary tree into the star graph","sourcePdf":"00494105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034171S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"31","articleId":"494105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":494107,"authors":[{"name":"S.

At the beginning of nineteen nineties some level of concern was expressed whether continuing along Moore\u2019s prediction makes economic sense. As a response to the above and other concerns in 1993 and 1994 the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has proposed \u201cThe National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.\u201d This Roadmap (which is also referred to as the \u201cSIA Roadmap\u201d) proposes a number of milestones to be achieved by the semiconductor industry in next 15 years [3]. The true objective of the SIA Roadmap seems to be, however, a consolidation of the vision of what should be the future of the entire semiconductor industry. Such a consolidation has been perhaps seen as a necessary step in focusing industry government and universities on the same technology development objectives. Unification of the objectives could be the most effective way to build momentum which could allow the equipment industry to meet all the challenges of subsequent submicron technologies. Hence, one can see the SIA Roadmap as a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" which facilitates continuation of the evolution of semiconductor industry along the Moore's Law. It should also be seen as an agenda focused on achieving ever smaller transistor sizes with ever more complex and, unfortunately, ever more expensive manufacturing processes. There are a number of very important implications of both the ambitious goals of the SIA Roadmap and the way these goals have been established. The most important of them are derivatives of a timely decrease-of-transistor-feature-size as primary goal of the Roadmap and strong focus on equipment-for-smaller-transistor related issues. Consequences of these two Roadmap\u2019s characteristics will have a strong impact on manufacturing, testing and design. This summary discusses some of them in more detail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 March 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494116/","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 March 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Future of testing: Reintegration of design, testing and manufacturing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future of testing: Reintegration of design, testing and manufacturing","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00494116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030067S","chronDate":"11-14 March 1996","isNumber":"10668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3563","citationCount":"9","articleId":"494116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":494129,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

Much of previous work has focused on estimation techniques that use very simple cost models based solely on the gate and/or literal count. Those models are not accurate enough to allow effective design space exploration since the effects of interconnect can indeed dominate the final design cost. The situation becomes even worse when the design is targeted to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technologies since the wire delay may contribute up to 60% of the overall design delay. In this paper, we present an approach of estimating area and timing for lookup table based FPGAs that takes into account not only gate area and delay but also the wiring effects. We select Xilinx XC4000 series as our main concentration because of their popularity. We tested our estimator with several benchmarks and the results show that we can get accurate area and timing estimates efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/EDTC.1996.494141","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ED&TC European Design and Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ED&TC European Design and Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3563/10668/00494141.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDTC.1996.494141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=494141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area and timing estimation for lookup table based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Mar 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494141/","displayDocTitle":"Area and timing estimation for lookup table based FPGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 March 1996","accessionNumber":"5309473","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area and timing estimation for lookup table based FPGAs","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00494141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049559S","chronDate":"11-14 Mar 1996","isNumber":"10668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3563","citationCount":"16","articleId":"494141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":494142,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The concept of a slack neighborhood graph is used as a general tool for timing driven reconfiguration with a low increase in critical path delay.

There is a consensus among researchers that adaptive step gains (learning rates) can stabilize and accelerate convergence and that a good starting weight set improves both the training speed and the learning quality. The training problem includes both the design of a network function and the fitting of the function to a set of input and output data points by computing a set of coefficient weights.

Advantages and limitations of some commonly employed verification techniques for substrate coupling are outlined. A preprocessed boundary element method introduced in this paper utilizes precomputed z parameters to generate an analytical model for substrate impedance in a preprocessing stage. Truncated series expansions of the analytical impedance model are used to accelerate solution of the resulting boundary element equations. A methodology that applies these fast techniques to the verification of large mixed-signal circuits and results that confirm its efficiency are described. This complete methodology has been applied to the design and verification of an industrial mixed-signal video analog-to-digital converter IC for substrate noise problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494197/","volume":"31","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5283087","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Verification techniques for substrate coupling and their application to mixed-signal IC design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verification techniques for substrate coupling and their application to mixed-signal IC design","sourcePdf":"00494197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03447S","chronDate":"Mar 1996","isNumber":"10664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"86","articleId":"494197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":494198,"authors":[{"name":"B.E.

Micromachining technologies such as bulk silicon micromachining, surface micromachining and electroplating techniques are first reviewed, and the most recent advances that have been made in each of these technologies are discussed. As microsystems become more complex, these three mainstream technologies will be increasingly used and combined to build complex systems at low cost. Many of these technologies have been utilized in the development of implantable biomedical systems. These systems offer a number of difficult actuators, and electronics or a combination of them, requirements that need to be satisfied, including small size, low power, functional versatility, and stable and biocompatible packaging. New micromachining and sensor technologies have been utilized to satisfy these challenges. This paper will also review integrated implantable microsystems that combine microsensors for measuring electrical and physical biological parameters, electronics for sensor interface and signal processing, telemetry for wireless communication and powering, and micromachining for batch packaging.","doi":"10.1109/MHS.1995.494211","pdfPath":"/iel3/3570/10679/00494211.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"MHS'95.

The authors study the feasibility of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) for the MS emergency locating in each of the three phases. The results are relevant to all GSM based systems, i.e., to DCS 1800 and to PCS 1900. The TDMA based GSM offers some inherent means of calculating the location of the MS. The serving cell is already known by the mobile switching centre (MSC) and if wanted also by the operation and maintenance center (OMC). A set of measurement functions is already implemented in the MS that can be used to locate it more accurately. We investigate the use of timing advance (TA) and observed timing difference (OTD). By using the existing measurement functions the complexity of the handsets and the network does not increase much and additional costs remain moderate.","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications Proceedings and Exhibition.

Co-channel interference (CCI) limits the performance of a spread spectrum multiple access communication link. Several CCI cancellation techniques have been proposed to remove this interference. Of particular interest are techniques which do not require the receiver to have knowledge of the cross-correlation between user sequences. These techniques reconstruct the CCI based on the initial decisions regarding the signals from the other users. However, these techniques leave residual interference after cancellation caused by errors in these initial decisions. To improve the initial decisions and reduce the residual interference, our proposed scheme utilizes the error correcting capability of orthogonal convolutional codes. This paper evaluates the performance of this scheme. We show that, given a processing gain of 128 for up to about 40 users, the performance of the proposed CCI canceller approaches the performance of a system without multi-user interference. We also show that the proposed CCI canceller offers an improvement in capacity by a factor of 1.5/spl sim/3 over that of a conventional canceller.","doi":"10.1109/26.494298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/10665/00494298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.494298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10665","startPage":"549","endPage":"556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A co-channel interference cancellation technique using orthogonal convolutional codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=494298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A co-channel interference cancellation technique using orthogonal convolutional codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5283357","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A co-channel interference cancellation technique using orthogonal convolutional codes","sourcePdf":"00494298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044196S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","articleId":"494298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":494300,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Kyoung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Radio Communication Science and Engineering, Hongik University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ho-Kyoung Lee","id":"37087337641"},{"name":"D.

We also decompose the generation of the proposed CPFSK waveform into two stages, an N-consecutive continuous phase encoder (NCPE) and a memoryless modulator (MM). This decomposition makes it possible to design binary convolutional encoders with various code rates, cascaded to the NCPE. Specific optimal outer convolutional encoders of two and three-consecutive full response four-ary CPFSK with modulation index 1/4 are designed following Ungerboeck's (1982) set partitioning approach.

This paper describes a new approach to hardware/software partitioning using integer programming (IP). The advantage of using IP is that optimal results are calculated respective to the chosen objective function. The partitioning approach works fully automatic and supports multi-processor systems, interfacing and hardware sharing. In contrast to other approaches where special estimators are used, we use compilation and synthesis tools for cost estimation. The increased time for calculating the cost metrics is compensated by an improved quality of the estimations compared to the results of estimators. Therefore, fewer iteration steps of partitioning will be needed. The paper shows that using integer programming to solve the hardware/software partitioning problem is feasible and leads to promising results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDTC.1996.494343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10668","startPage":"473","endPage":"479","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ED&TC European Design and Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3563/10668/00494343.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/software partitioning using integer programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Mar 1996","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/software partitioning using integer programming","conferenceDate":"11-14 March 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5309523","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/software partitioning using integer programming","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00494343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032799S","chronDate":"11-14 Mar 1996","isNumber":"10668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3563","citationCount":"67","articleId":"494343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":494357,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Kan Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Yi-Kan Cheng","id":"37350416900"},{"name":"E.

The method is based on a 2-D block decomposition technique and it is well suited to parallel computation, since almost all the operations are matrix multiplications and/or matrix-vector products. The proposed approaches can be also applied for computing 2-D inverse cosine transforms and can be extended to m-D design problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5290179","volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Frequency sampling design of 2-D quadrantally symmetric FIR filters by 2-D block decomposition technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency sampling design of 2-D quadrantally symmetric FIR filters by 2-D block decomposition technique","sourcePdf":"00494391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043322S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"2","articleId":"494391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":494400,"authors":[{"name":"F.F.

Specifically, the paper addresses the design of a dedicated processor structure that implements an audio FIR filter bank which is part of an industrial application. The algorithm requires a fixed number of steps and the moderate speed requirement allows a sequential implementation. The latter, in combination with a huge predominance of numerically small data values in the input data stream, is the key to a low-power asynchronous implementation. Power is minimized in two ways: by reducing the switching activity in the circuit, and by applying adaptive scaling of the supply voltage, in order to exploit the fact that the average case latency as 2-3 times better than the worst case. The paper reports on a study of properties of real life data, and discusses the implications it has on the choice of architecture, handshake-protocol, data-encoding, and circuit design. This includes a tagging scheme that divides the data-path into slices, and an asynchronous ripple carry adder that avoids a completion tree.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Second International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3564/10672/00494451.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"207","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Second International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.1996.494451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.1996.494451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=494451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power asynchronous data-path for a FIR filter bank","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Signal processing algorithms","Signal design","Streaming media","Switching circuits","Voltage","Delay","Circuit synthesis","Tagging","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","asynchronous circuits","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filter bank","asynchronous data-path","asynchronous signal processing circuits","audio FIR filter bank","tagging scheme","data-path","asynchronous ripple carry adder","signal processing circuits","sequential implementation","architecture","handshake-protocol","data-encoding","circuit design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Mar 1996","displayDocTitle":"A low-power asynchronous data-path for a FIR filter bank","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5226467","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 March 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power asynchronous data-path for a FIR filter bank","confLoc":"Fukushima, Japan","sourcePdf":"00494451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027005S","chronDate":"18-21 Mar 1996","isNumber":"10672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3564","citationCount":"15","articleId":"494451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":494599,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Both TE and TM scattering from a two-dimensional (2-D), perfectly conducting circular cylinder are used to test the accuracy of the methods for curved surfaces. Also, TE and TM scattering from a 2-D, perfectly-conducting rotated square cylinder are used to test the accuracy for corners and edges. It is shown that the conformal method proposed by Yee et al. provide significant improvement in accuracy over the original FDTD algorithm for most of the geometries studied. However, implementation becomes more difficult as the geometries become more complex. The conformal method proposed by Jurgens et al. provide significant improvement in accuracy as well for most of the geometries studied. However, improvement does not occur for the TM case when the square cylinder is not aligned properly with the grid. Implementation of the CPFDTD method is relatively straightforward. For the majority of the cases studied, the OGFDTD method is more accurate than the CPFDTD method.","doi":"10.1109/15.494622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/10670/00494622.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.494622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10670","startPage":"181","endPage":"187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of two conformal methods for FDTD modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=494622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of two conformal methods for FDTD modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5283169","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of two conformal methods for FDTD modeling","sourcePdf":"00494622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050006S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"4","articleId":"494622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":494640,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The scenario discussed in this paper is one where we have a set of objects that are modeled as implicit polynomial functions, or a set of representations of classes of objects with each object in a class modeled as an implicit polynomial function, stored in the database. Then, given partial data from one of the objects, we want to recognize the object (or the object class) or collect more data in order to get better parameter estimates for more reliable recognition. Two problems arising in this scenario are discussed: 1) the problem of recognizing these polynomials by comparing them in terms of their coefficients; and 2) the problem of where to collect data so as to improve the parameter estimates as quickly as possible. We use an asymptotic Bayesian approximation for solving the two problems.

This algorithm refines initial estimates of the transformation matrices obtained from either the calibrated acquisition setup or a crude manual alignment. It is an instance of a category of registration algorithms known as iterated closest-point (ICP) algorithms. The algorithm considers the network of views as a whole and minimizes the registration errors of all views simultaneously. This leads to a well-balanced network of views in which the registration errors are equally distributed, an objective not met by previously published ICP algorithms which all process the views sequentially. Experimental results show that this refinement technique improves the calibrated registrations and the quality of the integrated model for complex multi-part objects. In the case of scenes comprising man-made objects of very simple shapes, the basic algorithm faces problems common to all ICP algorithms and so must be extended.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/494643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","volume":"18","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5288458","publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Towards a general multi-view registration technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a general multi-view registration technique","sourcePdf":"00494643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06908S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"261","articleId":"494643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":494644,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to confirm the effectiveness of this method, most basic system calls of /spl mu/ITRON have been designed using an HDL. Synthesis results using a 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology show that most important part of the system calls can be realized as a VLSI chip. According to the evaluation results based on an FPGA implementation, hardware portion of these functionalities can be executed within 250 ns and the task scheduling can be performed within 750 ns simultaneously, which are about 6 to 50 times faster than software implementation.

In many cases this approach is inadequate and an optimisation approach is required. The need for this can arise in a various ways, including non-standard response specification, and the consideration of practical effects such as finite-arithmetic effects and computational complexity for digital filters, and component selection and device imperfections in analogue filters. Classical hill-climbing optimisation methods have succeeded in certain cases but are less suited to the general design task which can be mixed discrete/continuous, can have many local minima, and have high dimensionality. Recently genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation methods have emerged as a powerful approach to solving the more difficult optimisation problems. Publications are emerging in the literature on GAs applied to filter design and promise to move filter design significantly forwards to the ultimate goal of a single-step design from general specification to full practical implementation.

The dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the modulation index in SV signal transmission is analyzed to clarify the modulation index value required for reliable SV signaling.

Using this system, a systematical analysis of the pump induced modulation of the refractive index and dispersions for a signal at 1550 nm and a pump at 980 nm is reported. The analysis contains measurements of pump induced refractive index changes as function of wavelength, pump power, and doping concentration. A model taking account of the contribution to the refractive index changes from optical transitions between /sup 4/I/sub 15/2/ states and /sup 4/I/sub 13/2/ states in Er/sup 3+/ yields good agreement to experimental results apart from a wavelength independent offset. The offset is interpreted to originate from high energetic optical transitions. The results show that for a large refractive index modulation, a short and highly doped fiber should be used with limited amplified spontaneous emission effect. In optical communication systems comprising erbium doped fiber amplifiers, a tradeoff between dispersion and amplification must be made.","doi":"10.1109/50.495152","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10805/00495152.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.495152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10805","startPage":"732","endPage":"738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pump-induced refractive index modulation and dispersions in Er/sup 3+/-doped fibers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=495152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pump-induced refractive index modulation and dispersions in Er/sup 3+/-doped fibers","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5287802","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pump-induced refractive index modulation and dispersions in Er/sup 3+/-doped fibers","sourcePdf":"00495152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0352S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","articleId":"495152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":495165,"authors":[{"name":"N.V.

This formalism is well-suited for specifying hybrid systems where the dynamics of the continuous variables are defined or can be approximated by giving the minimal and maximal rate of change. To avoid the difficulties inherent in the verification of multirate timed automata, we follow an approach that consists of first transforming the multirate timed automata into timed automata and then applying the symbolic techniques implemented in KRONOS.

Periodic tasks are precedence constrained, distributed, and communicating over the nodes of the systems. Both soft and hard aperiodic tasks are handled. After a static schedule has been created in a first step, the algorithms determine the amount and distribution of unused resources and leeway in it. These are then used to incorporate aperiodic tasks into the schedule by shifting the periodic tasks' execution, without violating their feasibility. Run-time mechanisms are simple and require only little memory. Processors and communication nodes can be utilized fully. The algorithm performs on optimal online guarantee algorithm for hard aperiodic tasks of O(N).

This is especially true when the number of available input series is large, and an exhaustive search through all combinations of variables is computationally infeasible. Inclusion of irrelevant variables not only doesn't help prediction, but can reduce forecasting accuracy through added noise or systematic bias. We demonstrate a technique called \"sensitivity-based pruning\" (SBP) that removes irrelevant input variables from a nonlinear forecasting or regression model. The technique makes use of a saliency measure computed for each input variable and uses estimates of prediction risk for determining the number of input variables to prune. We present preliminary results of the SBP technique applied to neural network predictors of a key business cycle measure, the US Index of Industrial Production.","doi":"10.1109/CIFER.1995.495263","startPage":"118","endPage":"122","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3572/10681/00495263.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFER.1995.495263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input variable selection for neural networks: application to predicting the U.S. business cycle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Input variables","Neural networks","Economic indicators","Economic forecasting","Macroeconomics","Predictive models","Production","Industrial economics","Application software","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","forecasting theory","business data processing","production","sensitivity","search problems","commerce","economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input variable selection","neural network predictors","US business cycle prediction","best subset selection","noise","input series","irrelevant variables","forecasting accuracy","systematic bias","sensitivity-based pruning","nonlinear forecasting model","regression model","saliency measure","prediction risk estimates","input variables pruning","US Index of Industrial Production"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Input variable selection for neural networks: application to predicting the U.S. business cycle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1995","accessionNumber":"5188277","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input variable selection for neural networks: application to predicting the U.S. business cycle","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00495263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049723S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1995","isNumber":"10681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3572","citationCount":"16","articleId":"495263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":495265,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The centroids can be used as control points for image registration. The technique, which is fast, automatic, and knowledge-based, has two major steps. First, it searches the entire image volume to find one voxel inside each marker-like object. The authors call this voxel a \"candidate\" voxel, and they call the object a candidate marker. Second, it classifies the voxels in a region surrounding the candidate voxel as marker or nonmarker voxels using knowledge-based rules and calculates an intensity-weighted centroid for each true marker. The authors call this final centroid the \"fiducial\" point of the marker. The technique was developed on 42 scans of six patients-one CT and six MR scans per patient. There are four markers attached to each patient for a total of 168 marker images. For the CT images the false marker rate was zero. For MR the false marker rate was 1.4% (Two out of 144 markers). To evaluate the accuracy of the fiducial points, CT-MR registration was performed after correcting the MR images for geometrical distortion. The fiducial registration accuracy averaged 0.4 mm and was better than 0.6 mm for each of the eighteen image pairs.","doi":"10.1109/10.495282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"627","endPage":"637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/10802/00495282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.495282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automatic technique for finding and localizing externally attached markers in CT and MR volume images of the head","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Surgery","Magnetic heads","Magnetic resonance","X-ray imaging","Computer science","Image processing","Humans","Automatic control","Image registration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","computerised tomography","biomedical NMR","image registration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MR volume images","CT volume images","image processing technique","centroids localization","cylindrical markers","human head","fast automatic knowledge-based technique","marker-like object","candidate marker","intensity-weighted centroid","fiducial points","CT-MR registration","medical diagnostic imaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Analysis of Variance","Equipment Design","Fourier Analysis","Head","Head","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Prostheses and Implants","Sensitivity and Specificity","Skull","Software Design","Stereotaxic Techniques","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","displayDocTitle":"An automatic technique for finding and localizing externally attached markers in CT and MR volume images of the head","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5288191","pubMedId":"8987267","publicationDate":"June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495282/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automatic technique for finding and localizing externally attached markers in CT and MR volume images of the head","sourcePdf":"00495282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075314S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"10802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"128","articleId":"495282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":495427,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is our hypothesis that financial stock market trends may be predicted better over a set of markets instead of any one single market. A selection criterion is proposed in this paper to make this choice effectively. This criterion is based upon the observed backpropagation and recurrent neural networks' prediction accuracy, and the overall change recorded in the previous year. The results obtained when using data for four consecutive years over five international stock markets supports our claim. Backpropagation networks use gradient descent to learn spatial relationships. On the other hand, recurrent networks are capable of capturing spatiotemporal information from training data. This paper analyzes application of recurrent networks to the stock market return prediction problem in contrast with backpropagation networks. On the basis of the results observed during these experiments it follows that the effect of learning temporal information was not substantial on the prediction accuracy for the stock market returns.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backpropagation and recurrent neural networks in financial analysis of multiple stock market returns","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of HICSS-29: 29th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1996.495431","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of HICSS-29: 29th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/3511/10446/00495431.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"460 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1996.495431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=495431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jan 1996","displayDocTitle":"Backpropagation and recurrent neural networks in financial analysis of multiple stock market returns","conferenceDate":"3-6 Jan. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5232806","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backpropagation and recurrent neural networks in financial analysis of multiple stock market returns","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00495431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031116S","chronDate":"3-6 Jan 1996","isNumber":"10446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3511","citationCount":"34","articleId":"495431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":495479,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Under the critical conditions of a 2.4 GHz wireless LAN (Data rate is 1.4 Mbps, C/N>2 dB, that is E/sub b//N/sub 0/>13.6 dB, and operation temperature is from -20/spl deg/C to +60/spl deg/C.), good performance which is less than 10/sup -5/ bit error rate is achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface acoustic waves","Matched filters","Wireless LAN","Spread spectrum communication","Electrodes","Temperature dependence","Acoustic transducers","Acoustic waves","Demodulation","Surface impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","UHF filters","surface acoustic wave filters","compensation","wireless LAN","spread spectrum communication","surface acoustic wave transducers","losses","demodulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low loss SAW matched filter","unidirectional transducers","compensation method","temperature deviations","wireless LAN spread spectrum demodulator","128/spl deg/ Y-X LiNbO/sub 3/ substrate","floating electrode type unidirectional transducer","coded group type unidirectional transducer","phase error","spread spectrum receiver","self correlation characteristics","spreading code","bit error rate","BER","2.4 GHz","1.4 Mbit/s","-20 to 60 C","LiNbO/sub 3/"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495531","startPage":"7","endPage":"12 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

This low autocorrelation sequence of 25 chips was found to conform to the DS spreading DPSK signal. The sequence reduced the output signal sidelobe 6 dB lower than a 31 chip m-sequence, and further obtained a higher processing gain than that of Barker sequences. Furthermore, to reduce mismatch-loss in temperature stable SAW matched filters, a localized layered structure has been developed. ZnO is deposited only on the normal transducer on a ST-cut quartz substrate, reducing the mismatch-loss by 9 dB. An SS radio modem unit using this SAW matched filter shows a rather long transmission distance of about 20 m with a low current consumption 210 mA, considering such a high data rate 1 Mbps and the strict power regulation.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495551","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

In the past the main method for analysing these transducers has been the coupled-mode (COM) analysis. The latter is approximate mainly because it represents the transducer (which has a discrete nature) in terms of smoothly-varying quantities governed by differential equations; also the COM is not easily related to the transducer physics. Other theoretical approaches, based on the physics, are more accurate and justifiable, but are usually inconvenient and time-consuming to compute. The Reflective Array Model (RAM) presented here gives a method more accurate and better justified than the COM, while retaining the feature of computational convenience. Reflections are analysed by a cascading technique which gives the acoustic scattering with full accuracy even if the electrode reflection coefficient is large. Transduction analysis is based on the quasi-static method used for non-reflecting transducers. Because of its derivation from the electrostatic solution, this method is very accurate, giving for example correct harmonic responses and correctly modelling the effects of changing electrode width. In contrast to COM, the RAM is accurate for short transducers and for wide analysis bands, it can give correct harmonic responses and it easily analyses weighted transducers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflective array modelling for SAW transducers","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

The Green function is initially represented as a 4/spl times/4 matrix of functions in k (wavenumber) space; it describes the three surface displacement components and the electrical potential in terms of the three surface stress components and the surface charge density (line sources are assumed). The x space representation of the Green function is computed by a Fourier transform when required. The software includes facilities for locating and characterizing all singular points. The Green function method has been applied to the analysis of wave propagation in periodic structures including both electrical and mass loading effects; a simple normal mode model is used to describe the mechanical behaviour of the electrodes.

Areas outside the interdigital transducers can be either free surface or fully metallized: in the first case, a charge distribution formulation is used while, in the second one, a transverse E-field formulation is the most convenient representation. This method combines a BEM formulation using a semi-infinite dyadic Green's function and a FEM computation of the mechanical behavior of each metallic electrode. In order to limit the CPU time needed to perform such an analysis it has been necessary to develop a new powerful method to integrate the Green's functions. It has been possible to reduce this integration from a double integral of rapidly varying functions to a single integral of a slowly varying function, leading to easy numerical integration and allowing the use of this new numerical tool to rigorously analyze SAW filters with a total number of electrodes up to 200. It has been successfully used to analyze SAW filters based on short transducers for the 36/spl deg/ Y rotated cut of LiTaO/sub 3/. Comparisons between simulations and experiments will be presented, which show very good agreement.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495578","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Recently, numerical mixed FEM/BEM models have been presented to analyze periodic transducers including mass loading effects and the effectiveness of these methods have been demonstrated. However, the numerical interpolation used (\"pulse function\" or FEM basis function) is not well suited for stress and charge distribution representations leading to a great number of coefficients for each electrode. On the other hand, it is well known that charge distribution has a 1//spl radic/(1-x/sup 2/) singularity at both edges of each electrode and that T/sub n/(x)//spl radic/(1-x/sup 2/) type basis functions (where T/sub n/(x) is the first kind Chebyshev polynomial of rank n) are of practical use to develop functions exhibiting such discontinuities. In this paper, we will present a new mixed FEM/BEM model using this efficient basis function interpolation. Furthermore, this method incorporates results on the periodic harmonic Green's function for which only a very small number of spatial harmonics is necessary. As validation of this new periodic model, a comparison between simulation and experiment will be presented for the case of synchronous one port SAW resonators on 36/spl deg/ Y rotated cut LiTaO/sub 3/.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495579","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Transmission experiments in air at 3.1 MHz, 5.6 MHz, 9.2 MHz, and 11.4 MHz are reported. Custom circuitry is able to detect capacitance fluctuations on the order of 10/sup -18/ F and fluctuating as fast as 20 MHz. The transducers can be optimized for either transmission or reception. By leveraging the precise structural control provided by micromachining, receivers with displacement sensitivity well in the sub-angstrom range can be fabricated. Such detection sensitivity is shown to yield transducer systems with a 100 dB signal to noise ratio. An improved theoretical model for the transducers is presented. The theoretical model describes the static behavior of the membrane. Theoretical predictions of the dynamic behavior of the membrane also agree well with experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495627","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

The first method is called the Deconvolution Neural Network (DNN), the second method is named the Autoassociative Deconvolution Neural Network (ADNN), and the third method is referred to as the Probabilistic Deconvolution Neural Network (PDNN). The DNN trains the network by employing brute force and by exposing the network to a set of target echoes with and without noise. The ADNN processes the data for signal-to-noise ratio enhancement using an autoassociative neural network, and then applies the deconvolution neural network. The PDNN consists of two processing stages. The first stage estimates parameters using Gram-Charlier approximation to describe the probability density functions corresponding to target echoes and scattering noise. Then, in the second processing block, these parameters are used to classify and detect multiple target echoes. Results obtained in the performance analysis of these algorithms indicate that multiple interfering target echoes can be deconvolved and resolved accurately in the presence of noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495669/","accessionNumber":"5380459","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deconvolution neural networks for ultrasonic testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deconvolution neural networks for ultrasonic testing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00495669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044393S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3521","citationCount":"1","articleId":"495669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":495677,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The purpose of the present paper is to provide an overview of the applicability of the wavelet transform technique to the analysis of the propagation of dispersive ultrasonic waves. The wavelet transform is briefly introduced, with special emphasis on the relationship between the wavelet transform and the group velocity of dispersed signals. A complex mother wavelet is utilized to obtain the time evolution of the various spectral components of the ultrasonic signal, and the magnitude of the wavelet transform is used to represent the envelope of the ultrasonic pulse and to determine the time of arrival of the acoustic energy. This approach results in a time-scale representation of the ultrasonic signal which is extremely useful in the characterization of thin coatings using the dispersion behavior of the surface wave velocity. The technique was applied for the measurement of elastic constants of chromium coatings on steel substrates using laser-generated surface acoustic waves. Numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to discuss the usefulness of the wavelet transform.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495677","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

In order to obtain a narrow beam, the array length must be long and the number of elements must be large, making narrow beam arrays expensive. For the unequally spaced array, both the successive approximation method and dynamic program method are presented. The first method can provide the lowest side lobe level; the second method not only can give nearly the lowest side lobe level but it can specify the minimum spacing and all spacings will be an integral multiple of a unit length, making it easy to construct an array. A formula for estimating side lobe level is also presented. On average, the side lobe height obtained with a randomly spaced array will double or triple that obtained by the present methods. An amplitude shading approach for unequally spaced arrays is presented. Unequally spaced planar arrays are also discussed. For example, a 200 kHz circular sparse planar array of 1/spl deg/ beam width can be constructed using only 220 elements and its side lobe level can be suppressed to -20 dB. A fully populated square planar array would require 10,000 elements.

In the case where piezoelectric ceramic parameters are not available, the application of FEM to transducer design is very limited. A curve fitting method of estimating ceramic properties by coupling theory and FEM is described. The impedance of ceramic samples with various aspect ratios (width over thickness) were measured. The ceramic constants were adjusted in the FEM model to fit the experimental data. To reduce the number of degrees of freedom, a few of the key parameters, e.g., c/sub 11/, c/sub 13/, and c/sub 33/, were estimated from three samples by coupling theory. The sensitivity of the parameter variation to some special features of the impedance profile (e.g., f/sub s/, f/sub p/) were studied as a guideline for tuning the parameter value. Very good agreement between experiment and FEM over a wide range of aspect ratio (0.1-29) is obtained by this method.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495740","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Grating lobes in the two-way radiation pattern are avoided by using different element spacings for transmission and reception. The transmit and receive aperture functions are selected such that the convolution of the aperture functions produces a desired effective aperture. A desired effective aperture is simply an aperture with an appropriate width, element spacing and shape such that the Fourier transform of this function gives the desired two-way radiation pattern. Here, the authors apply the effective aperture method to the design of a sparse array for a very high frame rate (1,000 images/s) imaging system. The high frame rate is achieved by using synthetic aperture beam-forming utilizing only a few transmit pulses for each image. To compensate for the resulting loss in signal, the power delivered to each transmit element is increased and multiple transmit elements are used for each transmit burst. By mechanically rocking the array, in a way similar to what is done with an annular array, a three-dimensional set of images can be collected in the time normally required for a single image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5477892","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1995","displayDocTitle":"Design of sparse array imaging systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of sparse array imaging systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00495782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022829S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3521","citationCount":"20","articleId":"495782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":495785,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

The complexity of the fabrication is overcome using a multilayer flexible connector designed and fabricated using microelectronic techniques. The low SNR of 1 1/2 -D and 2-D arrays can be circumvented with the application of multi-layer ceramic elements to optimize the SNR given a specific transmit and receive configuration. In addition, optoelectronic transmitters allow for the reduction in size and increase in flexibility of the transducer cable because of the use of fiber optics.

To account for the short depth of the focal area a suitable imaging conception, the B/Z-scan concept (alternatively: B/D-Scan, B=/spl and/Brightness, D=/spl and/Depth) is used. To avoid the inhomogeneity of the images, different transmitter signals for each depth are applied, which are pseudoinversely prefiltered according to the transfer function of the covering tissue.

Parametric images are obtained by computing specular-to-diffuse ratios from the generalized spectra of each resolution cell. Variations in this ratio are used to identify distinct rf echo patterns caused by malignant tumors in breast tissue.

Second, each estimated image pixel is processed by an object-dependent weighting factor for further suppressing sidelobe energy. Experimental results based on phantom data show that, with this technique, the sidelobe energy resulting from DSB can be significantly reduced. The system CR is thus improved.

We propose a resolution metric for such systems that is the radius of a spherical void (in a uniformly backscattering continuum) that produces a given (averaged) dip in backscattered signal power when scanned. Which beam pattern produces the best \"cystic resolution\" (as we call this measure) is dependent upon the dynamic range of the imaging system. The imaging performance of several beam patterns are compared using using the old resolution criteria and this new metric.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5483610","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1995","displayDocTitle":"Towards a resolution metric for medical ultrasonic imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a resolution metric for medical ultrasonic imaging","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00495818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038109S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3521","citationCount":"21","articleId":"495818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":495851,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This gives problems when rapid B-mode image display is needed, since there is not time for measuring the velocity data. Gaps then appear in the sonogram and in the audio signal, rendering the audio signal useless, thus making diagnosis difficult. The current goal for ultrasound scanners is to maintain a high refresh rate for the B-mode image and at the same time attain a high maximum velocity in the sonogram display. This precludes the intermixing of the B-mode and sonogram pulses, and time must be shared between the two. Gaps will appear frequently in the sonogram since, e.g., half the time is spent on B-mode acquisition. The information in the gaps can be filled from the available information through interpolation. One possibility is to use a neural network for predicting mean frequency of the velocity signal and its variance. The neural network then predicts the evolution of the mean and variance in the gaps, and the sonogram and audio signal are reconstructed from these. The technique is applied on in-vivo data from the carotid artery. The neural network is trained on part of the data and the network is pruned by the optimal brain damage procedure in order to reduce the number of parameters in the network, and thereby reduce the risk of overfitting. The neural predictor is compared to using a linear filter for the mean and variance time series, and is shown to yield better results, i.e., the variances of the predictions are lower. The ability of the neural predictor to reconstruct both the sonogram and the audio signal, when only 50% of the time is used for velocity data acquisition, is demonstrated for the in-vivo data.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1995.495851","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Previously, reliability analyses assumed the controller always had to be in control, and periods of controller misbehavior were either ignored or declared to be system failure. It is possible, however, for a system to survive repeated controller perturbations because of plant dynamics. System inertia can prevent an incorrect command from leading to immediate catastrophe, and this time lag gives the controller an opportunity to recover. Recent advances place this idea on a quantitative basis by deriving results for the basic control criterion of asymptotic stability in terms of matrix norms. Translating a theoretical result into a laboratory experiment poses numerous problems and possibilities. We present the results of the experiment inducing some transmission perturbations on communication cable due to radiating EMI in the reverberation chamber. We consider four topics such as (i) parameter observation, (ii) predictive ability, (iii) asymptotic stability, and (iv) field data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.1996.495889","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference.

The influence of certain characteristics of these transforms such as regularity, number of vanishing moments, filter length, coding gain, frequency selectivity, and the shape of the wavelets on the coding performance is analyzed. The wavelet transforms performance is assessed based on a first-order Markov source and on the image quality, using subjective tests. More than 20 wavelet transforms of a test image were coded with a product code lattice quantizer with the image quality rated by different viewers. The results show that, as long as the wavelet transforms perform reasonably well, features like regularity and number of vanishing moments do not have any important impact on final image quality. The influence of the coding gain by itself is also small. On the other hand, the shape of the synthesis wavelet, which determines the visibility of coding errors on reconstructed images, is very important. Analysis of the data obtained strongly suggests that the design of good wavelet transforms for low bit-rate image coding should take into account chiefly the shape of the synthesis wavelet and, to a lesser extent, the coding.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/10607/00495953.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.495953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.495953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10607","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=495953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of linear phase wavelet transforms in low bit-rate image coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image coding","Shape","Wavelet analysis","Image quality","Testing","Filters","Performance gain","Frequency","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image reconstruction","wavelet transforms","transform coding","coding errors","error statistics","Markov processes","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear phase wavelet transforms","wavelet transforms performance","low bit rate image coding","vanishing moments","filter length","coding gain","frequency selectivity","wavelets shape","coding performance","first-order Markov source","image quality","subjective tests","test image","product code lattice quantizer","synthesis wavelet shape","coding errors visibility","image reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of linear phase wavelet transforms in low bit-rate image coding","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5279076","pubMedId":"18285159","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of linear phase wavelet transforms in low bit-rate image coding","sourcePdf":"00495953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063269S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"41","articleId":"495953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":495955,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

Good predictors are described, whose performance closely approaches limits imposed by sensor noise. It is imperative that these predictors make use of the high spectral correlations between bands. The residuals are encoded using variable-length coding (VLC) methods, and compression is improved by using eight codebooks whose design depends on the sensor's noise characteristics.

This algorithm is applicable for parallel-ray projections collected at a finite number of arbitrary view angles and radially sampled at a rate high enough that aliasing errors are small. The conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm is used to minimize a regularized, spectrally weighted least-squares criterion, and we prove that the main step in each iteration is equivalent to a 2-D discrete convolution, which can be cheaply and exactly implemented via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The proposed algorithm requires O(N/sup 2/logN) floating-point operations per iteration to reconstruct an N/spl times/N image from P view angles, as compared to O(N/sup 2/P) floating-point operations per iteration for iterative convolution-backprojection algorithms or general algebraic algorithms that are based on a matrix formulation of the tomography problem. Numerical examples using simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for sparse- and limited-angle tomography under realistic sampling scenarios. Although the proposed algorithm cannot explicitly account for noise with nonstationary statistics, additional simulations demonstrate that for low to moderate levels of nonstationary noise, the quality of reconstruction is almost unaffected by assuming that the noise is stationary.","doi":"10.1109/83.495957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.495957","endPage":"753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/10607/00495957.pdf","startPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast and accurate Fourier algorithm for iterative parallel-beam tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495957/","displayDocTitle":"A fast and accurate Fourier algorithm for iterative parallel-beam tomography","volume":"5","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5279080","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18285163","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast and accurate Fourier algorithm for iterative parallel-beam tomography","sourcePdf":"00495957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077949S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"45","articleId":"495957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":495975,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Cost requirements, on the other hand, impose simple hardware and cheap actuators in form of magnetorquer coils. These conflicting requirements are fulfilled through development of novel attitude and control algorithms and wide on-board autonomy. The entire control and attitude determination system has the ability to reconfigure in real time, based on mission phase and contingency operation requirements. Attitude determination embraces three different strategies, dependent on the availability of attitude sensors. Possible sensor faults are detected and a control system supervisor autonomously reconfigures attitude determination. Estimated satellite attitude and angular velocity are used in the attitude controller. Control tasks vary with the mission phase. Initially, after release from the launch vehicle, the angular velocity is controlled. In subsequent mission phases, the satellite is three-axis stabilized. The main contributions are development of novel algorithms for attitude control applying magnetic torquing, attitude determination schemes based on the geomagnetic field measurements, and integration into a supervisory control architecture. The salient feature of this system is fault tolerant autonomous operation with a minimum of hardware redundancy.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.1996.495975","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference.

The lab will facilitate the transition of technologies to flight. The infrastructure will be such that virtually any type of spacecraft payload or subsystem can be brought in, as long as the technologies are mature. The emphasis is placed upon the hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation evaluation. End to end HIL simulation has several benefits within the Phillips Lab, including (1) bringing forth spacecraft integration problems before spending millions of dollars to put a system into space, (2) exploring scenarios for in-flight anomalies and hardware and software failures, (3) showing the utility of component technologies and subsystems to the warfighter, (4) evaluating various potential mission concepts, (5) selling programs to upper management, (6) training of operators and educating lab personnel in how theater operations are performed with respect to obtaining data from space, Based on monetary constraints, the lab must leverage off of existing hardware in the loop facilities, such as Wright Lab's Kinetic Kill Vehicle HIL facility (KHILS), JPL's Flight System Testbed (FST), Arnolds Engineering Development Center (AEDC), etc., in terms of networking in, mimicking equipment, and utilizing lessons learned. The cost for setting up the HIL facility will be further reduced by building the lab based on requirements for the individual projects coming in, rather than up front construction of a HIL laboratory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Feb. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/495985/","accessionNumber":"5329156","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-10 Feb. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Space technology transition using hardware in the loop simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space technology transition using hardware in the loop simulation","confLoc":"Aspen, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00495985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020215S","chronDate":"10-10 Feb. 1996","isNumber":"10646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3554","citationCount":"11","articleId":"495985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":496003,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To maintain the control performance, the position of the rotor flux vector has to be known accurately. In this paper, a stochastic and a deterministic state-space estimator are compared using experimental results, as regards their estimate of the rotor resistance. Simulation results are used to compare stationary and synchronous reference frame versions of the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Induction machine core losses are usually neglected due to the required increase in model complexity. However, a standard method of core loss compensation which does not require higher order estimators is shown to improve the EKF and extended Luenberger observer accuracy, while requiring only a minimal increase in computation. The experimental system used to implement vector control and online rotor resistance estimation is also described.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Vector Control and Direct Torque Control of Induction Motors","pdfPath":"/iel3/3618/10743/00496003.pdf","startPage":"2/1","endPage":"2/5","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Vector Control and Direct Torque Control of Induction Motors","doi":"10.1049/ic:19951109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19951109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of stochastic and deterministic parameter identification algorithms for indirect vector control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asynchronous rotating machines","Machine windings","Parameter estimation","Observers","Torque control","Kalman filtering","Filtering","Stochastic processes","Deterministic algorithms","State space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","machine control","machine theory","machine testing","rotors","parameter estimation","observers","torque control","control system analysis","Kalman filters","filtering theory","stochastic processes","deterministic algorithms","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction machine","rotor flux vector","control performance","stochastic parameter identification algorithms","deterministic parameter identification algorithms","indirect vector control","state-space estimator","rotor resistance","extended Kalman filter","stationary reference frame","synchronous reference frame","core losses","compensation","extended Luenberger observer","accuracy","computation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of stochastic and deterministic parameter identification algorithms for indirect vector control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5162528","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-27 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of stochastic and deterministic parameter identification algorithms for indirect vector control","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00496003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022435S","chronDate":"27 Oct 1995","isNumber":"10743","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3618","citationCount":"7","articleId":"496003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496008,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Ink wettability on surfaces is decreased by decreasing the surface energies of substrates-the reduction in wettability improves the line resolution. For such high surface-energy substrates as ceramics, the effective means to improve the line resolution is to use high thixotropic inks. On the other hand, for low surface energy polymer substrates, the line resolution can be heightened by increasing the surface energies of inks. If the critical surface tension of a substrate is lower than the surface energy of inks, good line resolution can be achieved even though low viscosity inks were used. The use of low viscosity inks has quite a lot of advantages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5275764","volume":"19","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effect of surface energies on screen printing resolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of surface energies on screen printing resolution","sourcePdf":"00496047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065484S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"29","articleId":"496047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496077,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

These characteristics are of particular importance when signaling over radio channels, whereby waveforms experience multipath fading, multiple access interference, and, in military scenarios, intentional jamming. Broadband CDMA (BCDMA) is a version of CDMA that attempts to make most favorable use of the properties of CDMA signals by expanding the bandwidth of the CDMA waveforms to the greatest extent possible.

The scheduling process is intended to reduce the controlled appliances' power demand in accordance with a predefined load reduction profile. To solve this problem, a solution approach, based on the methodology of pulse width modulation (PWM), is introduced. This approach provides a flexible mathematical basis for studying different aspects of the scheduling problem. The conventional practices in this area are shown to be special cases of the PWM technique. By applying the PWM-based technique to the scheduling problem, important classes of scheduling errors are identified and analytical expressions describing them are derived. These expressions are shown to provide sufficient information to compensate for the errors. Detailed simulations of load groups' response to switching actions are used to support conclusions of this study.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Home appliances","Control systems","Load management","Least squares approximation","Power demand","Space vector pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","load management","load shedding","domestic appliances","load regulation","control system synthesis","switching","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","load reduction functions","aperiodic load group switching","residential appliances","load management system","power demand","load shedding scheduling","load reduction profile","PWM methodology","switching action response","direct load control design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.496145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/10801/00496145.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.496145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizing load reduction functions by aperiodic switching of load groups","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Realizing load reduction functions by aperiodic switching of load groups","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496145/","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5289329","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizing load reduction functions by aperiodic switching of load groups","sourcePdf":"00496145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028599S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"27","articleId":"496145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":496148,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

The input to the PSS consists of two signals. The first signal is mainly to damp the local mode in the area where PSS is located using the generator rotor speed as an input signal. The second is an additional global signal for damping interarea modes. Two global signals are suggested; the tie-line active power and speed difference signals. The choice of PSS location, input signals and tuning is based on modal analysis and frequency response information. These two signals can also be used to enhance damping of interarea modes using SVC located in the middle of the transmission circuit connecting the two oscillating groups. The effectiveness and robustness of the new design are tested on a 19-generator system having characteristics and structure similar to the Western North American grid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496152/","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5289349","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Damping controller design for power system oscillations using global signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping controller design for power system oscillations using global signals","sourcePdf":"00496152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027366S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"348","articleId":"496152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":496154,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Ming Lin","affiliation":["Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Ming Lin","id":"37087678338"},{"name":"V.

Subsynchronous resonance tests show that TCSC interactions with shaft dynamics of PGE's Boardman steam generator are well understood and are effectively avoided by normal TCSC valve firing logic. Modulation tests, performed with the Boardman plant offline, show that the TCSC can be a powerful and responsive actuator for swing damping. Security considerations did not permit lightly damped operation of the controlled plant. Close analysis indicates that the TCSC damping contribution, though small, was measurable. The best estimate is that damping for the McNary mode is 7.33% and 8.55%, for the TCSC damper loop open and closed respectively.

This reserve largely comes from three sources, generators, load shedding and demand relief. The estimation of this demand relief has proved difficult. This paper reports on a series of tests made on a 2800 MW system to identify parameters for a dynamic load model which could represent this relief. These tests measured load behaviour indirectly by monitoring system generation and frequency under specific operating conditions. Due to the discontinuous nature of the data, direct search methods had to be employed for the identification algorithm. The parameters were-cross validated by use in a system simulation of an actual contingency and the results obtained were encouraging.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/10801/00496165.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.496165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.496165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and validation of dynamic global load model parameters for use in power system frequency simulations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Power system dynamics","Power system modeling","System testing","Power generation","Frequency measurement","Condition monitoring","Search methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system security","power system measurement","power system analysis computing","parameter estimation","power system reliability","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system frequency simulations","dynamic global load model parameters","emergency reserve","black out","security","generators","load shedding","demand relief","power system tests","load behaviour","monitoring","operating conditions","direct search methods","identification algorithm","computer simulation","2800 MW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Identification and validation of dynamic global load model parameters for use in power system frequency simulations","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5289348","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and validation of dynamic global load model parameters for use in power system frequency simulations","sourcePdf":"00496165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036749S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"41","articleId":"496165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496166,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

The application of the fuzzy formulation is accompanied by a careful examination of the definition of fuzziness, appropriateness of the membership function and interpretation of results. The proposed concept provides a decision support system with integration-oriented features, whereby the decision-maker can learn to recognize the relative importance of factors in the specific domain of optimal fuel scheduling (OFS) problem.

In this approach, random disturbances are modeled as scenario trees. Optimization consists in minimizing the average generation cost over this \"tree-shaped future\". An augmented Lagrangian technique is applied to this problem. At each iteration, nonseparable terms introduced by the augmentation are linearized so as to obtain a decomposition algorithm. This algorithm may be considered as a generalization of price decomposition methods, which are now classical in this field, to the stochastic framework. At each iteration, for each unit, a stochastic dynamic subproblem has to be solved. Prices attached to nodes of the scenario trees are updated by the coordination level.

These are measurements whose projections on the space spanned by the row vectors of the weighted Jacobian matrix, the so-called factor space, do not follow the pattern of the bulk of the point cloud. In other words, their projections are outliers in the factor space. The proposed method is implemented through a new version of the projection algorithm that accounts for the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix. It assigns to each data point a projection statistic defined as the maximum of the standardized projections of the point cloud on some directions passing through the origin. Based on these projection statistics, a robustly weighted Schweppe-type GM-estimator is defined, which can be computed by a reweighted least squares algorithm. The computational efficiency and the robustness of the method are demonstrated on the IEEE-14 bus and the 118-bus systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496203/","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5289387","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Robust state estimation based on projection statistics [of power systems]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust state estimation based on projection statistics [of power systems]","sourcePdf":"00496203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035764S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"194","articleId":"496203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":496215,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We assume that the speech signal is modeled by a set of subword hidden Markov models (HMM) /spl Lambda//sub x/. The mismatch between the observed test utterance Y and the models /spl Lambda//sub x/ can be reduced in two ways: 1) by an inverse distortion function F/sub /spl nu//(.) that maps Y into an utterance X that matches better with the models /spl Lambda//sub x/ and 2) by a model transformation function G/sub /spl eta//(.) that maps /spl Lambda//sub x/ to the transformed model /spl Lambda//sub x/ that matches better with the utterance Y. We assume the functional form of the transformations F/sub /spl nu//(.) or G/sub /spl eta//(.) and estimate the parameters /spl nu/ or /spl eta/ in a ML manner using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The choice of the form of F/sub /spl nu//(.) or G/sub /spl eta//(.) is based on prior knowledge of the nature of the acoustic mismatch. The stochastic matching algorithm operates only on the given test utterance and the given set of speech models, and no additional training data is required for the estimation of the mismatch prior to actual testing. Experimental results are presented to study the properties of the proposed algorithm and to verify the efficacy of the approach in improving the performance of a HMM-based continuous speech recognition system in the presence of mismatch due to different transducers and transmission channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5284577","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A maximum-likelihood approach to stochastic matching for robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum-likelihood approach to stochastic matching for robust speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00496215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053902S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"237","articleId":"496215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":496217,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

In both cases, the optimization problem is transformed into a quadratic form using an internal model of one part of the physical system under control. The resulting architecture for the feedback controller is known as internal model control (IMC) and is widely used in the H/sub /spl infin// control literature. With this controller architecture, the optimum performance of a multichannel feedback system can be readily calculated using the quadratic optimization techniques already developed in the sampled time domain for multichannel feedforward control. The robustness of the stability of such a feedback controller to changes in the plant response can be separately assessed using a generalization of the complementary sensitivity function, which has a particularly simple form when IMC is used. The stability robustness can be improved by incorporating various forms of effort weighting into the cost function being minimized, some of which are already used for adaptive feedforward controllers. By way of example, the performance is calculated of both feedforward and feedback controllers for the active attenuation of road noise in cars. The variation of performance with loop delay is calculated for both types of control, and it is found that in this example, the potential attenuation is greatest using feedback control but only if the loop delay is less than 1.5 ms.","doi":"10.1109/89.496217","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","startPage":"214","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/10806/00496217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.496217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of feedforward and feedback systems for active control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Adaptive control","Robust stability","Feedback control","Robust control","Attenuation","Delay","Control system synthesis","Noise robustness","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","feedback","active noise control","optimal control","H/sup /spl infin// control","random processes","random noise","optimisation","robust control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward systems","feedback systems","active control","optimal performance","random disturbances attenuation","quadratic form","internal model control","H/sub /spl infin// control","multichannel feedback system","sampled time domain","multichannel feedforward control","stability","plant response","complementary sensitivity function","cost function","adaptive feedforward controllers","road noise","cars","loop delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Performance of feedforward and feedback systems for active control","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5284579","publicationDate":"May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496217/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of feedforward and feedback systems for active control","sourcePdf":"00496217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039476S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"99","articleId":"496217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496221,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Data were collected over grass, lake, ice, snow, concrete, asphalt, and gravel surfaces. The transmit antenna was kept fixed, while the receive antenna translated vertically resulting in grazing angles between approximately 0.5-2.0\u00b0. Full illumination of the Fresnel zones was accomplished by broad-beamwidth horn antennas at both ends. Measured interference patterns indicate the presence of both specular and diffuse multipath components. A technique was developed to separate these components by filtering in the spatial Fourier-transform domain by appropriate choice of the notch frequency for the specular component and the bandpass-filter bandwidth for the diffuse components. The notch frequency is chosen according to system geometry considerations. Using this unique separation technique, specular and diffuse reflection coefficients were deduced for various terrain types.

The radar is based on a time-domain reflectometer module for a sampling oscilloscope. Using transient excitation of a traveling wave-tube amplifier, the system generates 200-ps wide pulses with a 10-GHz center frequency and a peak power of approximately 1 KW. The resulting range resolution is approximately 3 cm. The system was used to investigate low-grazing angle, multipath effects in the ocean environment using a trihedral corner reflector, mounted 45 cm above the water surface. The ultrahigh-range resolution of the system allows spatial separation of the direct and indirect echoes from the trihedral. In addition, a comparison of the indirect vertically- (VV) and horizontally- (HH) polarized echoes illustrates the effects of Brewster angle damping. The implications of these effects for sea-clutter statistics are briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/8.496249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/10599/00496249.pdf","startPage":"646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.496249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawide-band radar observations of multipath propagation over the sea surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496249/","displayDocTitle":"Ultrawide-band radar observations of multipath propagation over the sea surface","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277036","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrawide-band radar observations of multipath propagation over the sea surface","sourcePdf":"00496249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031509S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","articleId":"496249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496251,"authors":[{"name":"R.

On the first pass, the electromagnetic response of the target is externally determined with the aperture foiled over. The current flowing on the foil is recorded and used to illuminate the aperture on the second pass. Almost no detail of the target external to the aperture need be supplied for the second-pass computation. This makes possible very efficient use of available clomputer memory for concentrating on cavity details. The technique can treat electrically large apertures. The example used here is a fighter aircraft where the cavity is the cockpit and thLe cockpit bubble is the aperture. There is no appeal to superposition inside the cavitykockpit, so nonlinear electromagnetic phenomena may be included there in the model.","doi":"10.1109/8.496251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/10599/00496251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.496251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10599","startPage":"659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-pass finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations on a fighter aircraft","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-pass finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations on a fighter aircraft","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277038","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-pass finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations on a fighter aircraft","sourcePdf":"00496251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042702S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"1","articleId":"496251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496252,"authors":[{"name":"Shiann-Jeng Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shiann-Jeng Yu","id":"37350519600"},{"name":"Ju-Hong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ju-Hong Lee","id":"37280309400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"496252","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Convergence","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Narrowband","Power generation","Delay","Interference cancellation","Councils","Signal analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the statistical performance of several eigenspace-based adaptive array bearnformers, including conventional direct-form beamformers and generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC).

A proper formulation of the problem is considered as a quadratic inverse one whose data is the square amplitude of the near field. A solution is introduced as the global minimum of an appropriate functional. Next, to perform such a minimization procedure, a finite dimensional representation of the field radiated by sources whose plane-wave spectrum becomes negligible outside a fixed angular domain is used. A detailed investigation of the properties of the mapping connecting the unknowns to the data makes it possible to analyze how to escape from the local minima possibly met in the course of the minimization procedure. To this end, the crucial role of the availability of phaseless data over two different sarfa,ces and of appropriate weights in the functional definition is emphasized, and a reliable iterative procedure converging on the solution, regardless of the starting point, is thus obtained. This property is confirmed by experimental results concerning near-zone data from a shaped reflector at 9 Ghz. It can be readily appreciated that when only the field intensity is detected the complexity and the cost of the equipment required for near-field techniques in antenna testing and diagnostics can be reduced to a very large extent.","doi":"10.1109/8.496257","startPage":"701","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/10599/00496257.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.496257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation pattern evaluation from near-field intensities on planes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase measurement","System testing","Iterative algorithms","Antenna radiation patterns","Senior members","Joining processes","Availability","Costs","Character generation","Antenna measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Radiation pattern evaluation from near-field intensities on planes","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5277044","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation pattern evaluation from near-field intensities on planes","sourcePdf":"00496257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038283S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"128","articleId":"496257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":496258,"authors":[{"name":"D.

By splitting the propagator matrix into contributions from the left and from the right of the point of observation, a second kind integral equation can be formed with a new Born term and a new kernel. Following discretization of this new integral equation, the unknown currents can be determined more rapidly and with significantly less storage requirements than conventional LU decomposition; where the time saving factor is roughly N/3 where N is the number of current samples on the surface and the usual storage requirements associated with matrix inversion are eliminated. While the new Born term is usually adequate for scattered field calculations, the new discretized integral equation can be iterated to amy desired accuracy with no apparent convergence problems.

In this paper, a novel technique based on fractal structures is described for multiband operation. The analysis is focused in two different approaches: the fractal spatial arrangement of array elements and the fractal design of array factors. Although the patterns of fractal arrays show some interesting similarity properties at several bands, the directivity is not held constant through the bands. Nevertheless, such structures have been shown to be useful for designing low side-lobe arrays with equally weighted current elements. On the other hand, the fractal array factors presented do keep the same shape at several bands because they are designed as selfsimilar curves. The arrays that would synthesize such patterns present a characteristic power-law current distribution analogous to the spectral distribution of the bandlimited fractal Weierstrass function.","doi":"10.1109/8.496259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/10599/00496259.pdf","startPage":"730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.496259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractal design of multiband and low side-lobe arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496259/","displayDocTitle":"Fractal design of multiband and low side-lobe arrays","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5277047","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractal design of multiband and low side-lobe arrays","sourcePdf":"00496259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038029S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"117","articleId":"496259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496261,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The numerical model is based on Monte Carlo simulation using an iterative version of the method of moments known as the sparse-matrix flat-surface iterative approach (SMFSIA). Experimental data is obtained from millimeter wave laboratory experiments in which the bistatic scattering patterns of fabricated surfaces with known statistical parameters were measured. The surfaces studied have both a Gaussian height distribution and correlation function, so that their statistics are characterized by an rms height and correlation length. An rms height of 1 wavelength and correlation lengths ranging from 1.41-3 wavelengths are investigated in this paper, and the phenomenon of backscattering enhancement is observed both in the numerical predictions and experimental data. A comparison of the absolute value of the bistatic scattering coefficient as normalized by the incident power shows the theory and experiment to be in good agreement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496261/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5277049","publicationDate":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Backscattering enhancement of electromagnetic waves from two-dimensional perfectly conducting random rough surfaces: a comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backscattering enhancement of electromagnetic waves from two-dimensional perfectly conducting random rough surfaces: a comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data","sourcePdf":"00496261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045445S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"94","articleId":"496261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":496264,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The enhancement-mode MOSFET, used extensively in analog and digital circuits, has a particular advantage for high temperature operation because of its insulated gate. Research in this area has produced SiC n-channel depletion-mode devices/circuits and n-channel enhancement-mode digital gates operating from 25 to 300/spl deg/C. In this report, we demonstrate the first p-channel enhancement-mode MOSFETs and integrated circuits with good characteristics from 25 to 500/spl deg/C. The first enhancement-mode NMOS operational amplifier has also been fabricated and tested. The limited transconductance of SiC MOSFETs makes it difficult to produce sizable voltage gains without active loads.

A physical model, based on newly obtained experimental results, is proposed wherein the leakage variation is mainly due to a variation of local electric field strength enhancement.","doi":"10.1109/DRC.1995.496313","publicationTitle":"1995 53rd Annual Device Research Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 53rd Annual Device Research Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3596/10711/00496313.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.1995.496313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical model of bit-to-bit variation in data retention time of DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Physical model of bit-to-bit variation in data retention time of DRAMs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5280821","publicationDate":"1995","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical model of bit-to-bit variation in data retention time of DRAMs","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00496313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032442S","chronDate":"19-21 June 1995","isNumber":"10711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3596","citationCount":"6","articleId":"496313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":496360,"authors":[{"name":"Hee Il Ahn","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hee Il Ahn","id":"37087986543"},{"name":"Seung Kee Han","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Col. of Art and Sci, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung Kee Han","id":"37087644093"},{"name":"Tae Won Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electric Eng., Col. of Eng, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae Won Cho","id":"37087269243"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2624-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"496360","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Routing","Very large scale integration","Neural networks","Genetic mutations","Biological cells","Physics","Art","Circuit synthesis","Printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","network routing","circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit layout","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GenRouter","genetic algorithm","channel routing problems","global routing","VLSI circuit design","multiprocessing environment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496360","abstract":"A genetic algorithm for channel routing problems is presented in this paper.

This suggests that the technique will be better suited for VLSI or ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) implementations because of the reduction in chip size and increased optimization options. In particular, digital circuits realized from RM universal logic modules (RM-ULMs) have a very simple structure and will incur less propagation delay.

The use of interpolation methods to perform such corrections is also discussed. In the training phase of the ANN, backpropagation and random optimization algorithms have jointly been used to adjust the weights of the network for a desired final error. After training the ANN, it is then used as a neural linearizer to generate the primary variable (temperature) from the thermocouple's output voltage. The accuracy of this method is compared with those obtained by interpolation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Jul1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496622/","accessionNumber":"5281123","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-14 July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An artificial neural network to linearize a G (tungsten vs. tungsten 26% rhenium) thermocouple characteristic in the range of zero to 2000/spl deg/C","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial neural network to linearize a G (tungsten vs. tungsten 26% rhenium) thermocouple characteristic in the range of zero to 2000/spl deg/C","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"00496622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040804S","chronDate":"10-14 Jul1995","isNumber":"10699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3587","citationCount":"12","articleId":"496622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496623,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Each assembly plan is encoded into a chromosome, to be manipulated by genetic operators. A reproduction process uses these operators to produce new assembly plans from \"parents\" assembly plans. An evaluation function and a selection procedure retain the best plans that expand the population and serve for new generations.

In computer systems, scheduling is an important approach to address real-time constraints associated with a set of computing tasks to be executed on one or several computers. Most of the scheduling problems are NP-hard, which is why heuristic and approximation algorithms must be used for large problems. Obviously these methods are of interest when they provide near optimal solutions with a polynomial computational complexity. This paper presents results for scheduling a set of nonpreemptive tasks by using a Hopfield neural network model.

Modules can interact by event signals which force state transitions in the module receiving the event signals (the supervisor) and by condition signals. Based on this idea, the uniform, modular modeling concept of condition/event systems (C/E systems) has been introduced by Sreenivas and Krogh (1991). The definition of C/E systems as input-output systems with two types of signals does not imply a particular form of the models to represent the dynamic behavior of the modules.

The GA has been traditionally used for getting the solution in past researches on scheduling. However, the application of GA to getting the solution causes reproduction problems, in which the solution generated from the same scheduling problem is not always the same. In addition, a great deal of time is needed to solve each problem. On the other hand, in the authors' proposed method, the GA is applied to learning scheduling knowledge. Though it takes a great deal of time in learning the knowledge, little time is needed to solve problems in the daily operation phase, and the reappearance feature is guaranteed. The representation of scheduling knowledge by gene is usually difficult, because it is necessary to carry out crossover operation on a gene and the representation of knowledge is much more complex than the representation of the solution of a planning problem. To cope with the representation problem, the authors introduce tree construction for representing status selection knowledge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5195122","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A learning method of scheduling knowledge by genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A learning method of scheduling knowledge by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00496816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038947S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct 1995","isNumber":"10686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3576","citationCount":"2","articleId":"496816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":496850,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Bo Wu","id":"37087147336"},{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Qiang Wang","id":"37087157972"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2955-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"496850","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496850","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Local area networks","Game theory","Throughput","Access protocols","Electronic mail","Performance loss","Loss measurement","Intserv networks","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless LAN","access protocols","performance evaluation","probability","optimisation","packet radio networks","game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slotted ALOHA wireless LAN","throughput","capture effect","network performance","unfairness","game theoretic approaches","optimization","fairness","finite population network model","fixed position capture model","performance measures","transmission probabilities","multiobjective analytic approach","packet wireless LAN"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496850","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00496850.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","startPage":"12","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiobjective analytic framework for slotted ALOHA wireless LANs","abstract":"This paper presents a multiobjective analytic framework for the study of individual performance requirements in a multi-class slotted ALOHA wireless local area network (WLAN).

The proposed framework, which is based on several game theoretic approaches, attempts to address the issues of optimization and fairness jointly. Various concepts of optimality are introduced, in which the criteria of fairness are embedded. A finite-population network model and a fixed-position capture model are established, and the performance measures of the network are evaluated.

To efficiently estimate the received signal strength of each user, a linear minimum mean square unbiased estimator (LMMSE) is used. Applying the minimum mean square error (MMSE) Bayesian estimation, we further propose the LMMSE bit estimator which can efficiently demodulate the information bits. We demonstrate its close performance to the optimum multiuser receiver but with much simpler polynomial complexity. Furthermore, we extend our LMMSE estimator to the sequential LMMSE estimator. In sequential estimation, we do not need to implement the matched filters and perform the matrix inversion when estimating. In addition, the convergence speed is approximately 2k times of iterations; where k is the number of users. Moreover, the sequential LMMSE estimator can be easily generalized to the asynchronous transmission case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5296789","displayDocTitle":"A linear minimum mean square error multiuser receiver in Rayleigh fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear minimum mean square error multiuser receiver in Rayleigh fading channels","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067215S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"2","articleId":"496860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":496870,"authors":[{"name":"Chaehag Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engr., Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chaehag Yi","id":"37343739300"},{"name":"Jae Hong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engr., Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Hong Lee","id":"37336646300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2955-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"496870","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Wireless communication","Bit rate","Data communication","ISDN","Delay effects","Interchannel interference","Fading","Diversity reception","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiocommunication","data communication","telecommunication network reliability","quadrature amplitude modulation","diversity reception","cochannel interference","delays","fading","Rayleigh channels","Gaussian noise","white noise","convolutional codes","modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier M-ary QAM","performance","wireless communications","high bit rate data transmission","delay spread","cochannel interference","fading compensation techniques","diversity reception","communications reliability","frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel","additive white Gaussian noise","convolutional coding"]}],"abstract":"High bit rate data transmission is required for video, high quality audio, and mobile ISDN services in wireless communications.

This paper describes a CDMA cellular system based on adaptive interference cancellation (CDMA-AIC) with a large capacity. In the CDMA-AIC, each base station employs a single-user type adaptive interference canceller (AIC), which consists of a fractionally chip-spaced code-orthogonalizing filter (COF) and a differential detector. The AIC adaptively removes power dominant multiple access interferences (MAIs) in the cellular system, regardless of whether they are intra-cell interferences or inter-cell interferences, without any information about them, such as spreading codes, signal received timings and channel parameters. Evaluation under the multiple cell environment demonstrates that the reverse link capacity of the CDMA-AIC with QPSK modulation is fourfold or more, compared with the capacity of the CDMA without MAI cancellation. Further, the capacity is less sensitive to transmission power control errors than that of the conventional CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496877","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00496877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","startPage":"148","endPage":"152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity evaluation of CDMA-AIC: CDMA cellular system with adaptive interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity evaluation of CDMA-AIC: CDMA cellular system with adaptive interference cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496877/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296806","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity evaluation of CDMA-AIC: CDMA cellular system with adaptive interference cancellation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035656S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"1","articleId":"496877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":496878,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

We consider a a DS/SS system employing adaptive multistage interference cancellation at the base station of a code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless system. Previous work has demonstrated the potential for significant improvements in capacity and near-far resistance. However, most previous work has assumed perfect synchronization with the signals of interest. Practical systems will experience phase jitter and timing errors. We undertake an analysis of the effects of phase and timing errors, obtaining a closed form result for bit error rate performance after an arbitrary number of stages of cancellation. This result agrees well with simulations. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that interference cancellation is fairly robust to phase and timing errors.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496878","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00496878.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","startPage":"153","endPage":"157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of CDMA multistage interference cancellation with phase and timing errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of CDMA multistage interference cancellation with phase and timing errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496878/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296807","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of CDMA multistage interference cancellation with phase and timing errors","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043231S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"2","articleId":"496878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":496879,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.K.

A novel multi-stage successive interference cancellation scheme is proposed which operates on the reverse CDMA link using BPSK modulation, coherent detection and reference symbols to obtain channel estimates. The results of a single cell multi-user investigation show that the traffic capacity can be increased. However, the total traffic capacity is somewhat disappointing because the channel estimates are corrupted significantly by interference from symbols not yet demodulated and cancelled by the receiver. The transmitted signal structure is, therefore, modified to decrease that interference. The results of a single cell analysis of the modified cancellation scheme demonstrate that the system's traffic capacity reaches approximately 80% of that of a multistage successive interference cancelling receiver operating on perfect channel parameters. The multi-cell results show that for hexagonal cell geometry with path loss exponent of 4 and without any forward error correction coding the capacity of the system is between 1.5 and 2.5 times that using the conventional matched filter receiver.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00496879.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance issues in successive interference cancellation with reference symbol assisted channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance issues in successive interference cancellation with reference symbol assisted channel estimation","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5296808","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance issues in successive interference cancellation with reference symbol assisted channel estimation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034087S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"4","articleId":"496879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":496887,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A series of indoor measurements was also done with the transmitter in a single location in a side corridor and the receiver moving along a route following a main corridor. Outdoor measurements were done on the university campus in a large courtyard-like area, completely surrounded by irregular shaped buildings, and complicated by the three dimensional factors of sloping ground levels, and various elevated pedestrian bridges, which could not be included in the two dimensional ray tracing database.

Computer simulation results indicate that the user capacity of the TDD mode is slightly better for a single path (no diversity) B-CDMA system. The capacity is significantly increased for multipath selection diversity combining systems for both modes, where the user capacity of the TDD reverse link is again slightly better. In the forward link, however, the capacity is only similar if the FDD mobile receivers have a diversity reception capability. Otherwise, the TDD system has a higher user capacity of about 4 dB, because a pre-selection diversity combining technique allows the realisation of diversity reception at TDD mobile units without increasing their complexity. The effect of variable transmission power, resulting from the power control function is investigated. The average transmitted power is measured to find the level of interference on neighboring cells and the resulting change in user capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison on the performance of the FDD and TDD modes of B-CDMA communications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496917","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00496917.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"A comparison on the performance of the FDD and TDD modes of B-CDMA communications","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296846","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison on the performance of the FDD and TDD modes of B-CDMA communications","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037322S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"3","articleId":"496917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":496918,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhengmao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications & lnformation systems, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Li Zhengmao","id":"38152864100"},{"name":"Lu Bing","affiliation":["Institute of Communications & lnformation systems, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Lu Bing","id":"38142521400"},{"name":"Lu Fan","affiliation":["Institute of Communications & lnformation systems, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Lu Fan","id":"38147344900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2955-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"496918","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Feedback","Power control","Land mobile radio","Power system modeling","Adaptive filters","Traffic control","Acceleration","Gaussian distribution","Random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal communication networks","land mobile radio","code division multiple access","feedback","telecommunication control","power control","radio links","channel capacity","adaptive filters","adaptive signal processing","filtering theory","telecommunication traffic","Gaussian distribution","random processes","estimation theory","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA personal system","feedback power control","mobile radio communication systems","near-far problem solution","reverse link","radio capacity","forward link","power control system","short term average SIR","transmitted power estimation","weight-value map","adaptive filter","mobile station traffic model","mobile station acceleration","stationary white Gaussian distribution random process","simulation results","personal communication systems"]}],"abstract":"Code-division multiple access (CDMA) has been proposed to increase the radio capacity in the personal and mobile radio communication systems.

The influence of frequency-offset on reception of M-ary/SS signals is investigated and it is shown that frequency-offset may degrade the symbol-error-rate performance remarkably, yet, the influence has a distinctive property. Making use of this property, we propose a new scheme that can mitigate the influence of the frequency-offset. The scheme is based on the assignment of the two distinctive Hadamard codes to in-phase and quadrature components of the transmitted signal. The selection of the set of Hadamard codes and the power ratio of the in-phase and quadrature component of the transmitted signal is evaluated in terms of symbol-error-rate and carrier frequency offset. As a result we found that the scheme shows the satisfactory symbol-error-rate in the presence of carrier frequency offset up to a half of symbol rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296861","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A study on non-coherent reception of M-ary spread-spectrum signals in the presence of carrier frequency offset","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on non-coherent reception of M-ary spread-spectrum signals in the presence of carrier frequency offset","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041014S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"4","articleId":"496932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":496933,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

System capacity depends on how diversity handover is applied. This paper describes reverse and forward link system capacity for several typical handover schemes under transmit power control (TPC) based on SIR as determined by computer simulations. First, both link system capacities are shown under perfect TPC. These results give an ideal upper limit of capacity. We examine the increase in system capacity achieved by maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) and sectorization. Next, we consider TPC error, which leads to more realistic capacity values. This shows that system capacity with DHO is larger than with hard handover (HHO) in both links. Especially with MRC-DHO in the forward link, there is an optimum threshold for DHO that maximizes the capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496934","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00496934.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of diversity handover in DS-CDMA cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496934/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of diversity handover in DS-CDMA cellular systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296863","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of diversity handover in DS-CDMA cellular systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027773S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"9","articleId":"496934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":496935,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Kong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ning Kong","id":"37350879600"},{"name":"T.

An efficient series that is used to calculate the probability of error for a BPSK modulated DS CDMA system with chip timing and carrier phase errors in a slowly fading, multipath channel is derived. The receiver is assumed to be a coherent RAKE receiver that employs selection diversity. The error probability derivations require the characteristic functions of the intersymbol interference and the multiple access interference and these functions have been expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function. The series is then used to assess the reduction in the system capacity due to different levels of synchronization errors. Systems of 1.25 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz bandwidths are considered for different number of diversity branches.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496936","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00496936.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of selection diversity for a DS CDMA system with synchronization errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=496936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/496936/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of selection diversity for a DS CDMA system with synchronization errors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296865","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of selection diversity for a DS CDMA system with synchronization errors","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00496936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040716S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"6","articleId":"496936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":496937,"authors":[{"name":"G.

TDMA or CDMA system is considered in the integrated system. The calculated results show that microcell can reuse the channels assigned to macrocell in TDMA system. In CDMA system, the site diversity between macrocell and microcell is required to obtain high capacity gain owing to the frequency reuse between micro and macrocells. This fact means the loss of the benefits of the macrocell system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00497082.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"619","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.497082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.497082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=497082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of integrated macro and microcell systems applied to TDMA or CDMA cellular systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microcell networks","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Macrocell networks","Interference","Frequency","Signal analysis","Capacity planning","Base stations","Investments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time division multiple access","code division multiple access","probability","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","radio spectrum management","frequency allocation","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated macro-microcell systems","TDMA","CDMA","cellular systems","traffic","capacity","probability","carrier to interference signal power ratio","site diversity","frequency reuse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance of integrated macro and microcell systems applied to TDMA or CDMA cellular systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of integrated macro and microcell systems applied to TDMA or CDMA cellular systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00497082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041876S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"2","articleId":"497082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":497083,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Twin VQ is a low-bit-rate audio-coding method that achieves high-quality under error-free conditions, at less than 64 kbit/s. To make this method applicable to wireless systems, which have a higher bit-error rate due to inferior transfer conditions, the Twin VQ coding algorithm has been improved. About 90% of Twin VQ encoded bits were found to be insensitive to channel errors, so using the BS-FEC method, error protection is weighted to the sensitive bits. Subjective evaluation tests showed that Twin VQ with BS-FEC maintains good quality over, high bit-error-rate channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296940","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A design of Twin VQ audio-codec for personal communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design of Twin VQ audio-codec for personal communication systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00497120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028398S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"2","articleId":"497120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":497124,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong-Chul Ahn","affiliation":["Korea Mobile Telecom, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeong-Chul Ahn","id":"38141196800"},{"name":"Yong-Wan Park","affiliation":["Korea Mobile Telecom, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong-Wan Park","id":"37293566800"},{"name":"An-Na Choi","affiliation":["Korea Mobile Telecom, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"An-Na Choi","id":"37447502000"},{"name":"Seung-Moon Ryu","affiliation":["Korea Mobile Telecom, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Moon Ryu","id":"37346381700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2955-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"497124","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Personal communication networks","Multiaccess communication","Frequency synchronization","Costs","Telecommunication services","Environmental economics","Testing","Speech","Cellular networks","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal communication networks","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","synchronisation","cellular radio","subscriber loops","radio links","telecommunication channels","differential pulse code modulation","speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless access technology","CDMA","PCS","picocell environment","microcell environment","coherent DS-CDMA","reverse link","forward link","intercell asynchronous mode","channel synchronization","voice coding","ADPCM","channel structure","testbed","32 kbit/s"]}],"abstract":"KMT has developed wireless access technology with its own CDMA method to provide economical and satisfactory PCS.

In the network simulation program models for pedestrian behaviour, teletraffic, interference, power control, and handover have been developed. The network simulation program uses the propagation data calculated by the ray launching program. The ray launching program computes the radio channel impulse responses by utilising geometrical optics and the geometrical theory of diffraction.

Performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with BPSK modulation is evaluated over a large empirical data base of indoor radio propagation channels. These indoor channels have lognormal amplitude fading and modified Poisson distribution of the arrival time of multipath components. The performance is evaluated in terms of the average probability of bit error as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. The influence of changing the number of tones as well as the guard interval on the average bit error rate is investigated.

A novel data-based frame synchronization method for OFDM-systems is presented. OFDM frames are shown to contain sufficient information to synchronize a system without the use of pilots. The cyclic extension, preceding OFDM frames, is of decisive importance for this method. Based on only the sign bits of the in-phase and the quadrature components of the received OFDM signal, the maximum likelihood solution is derived. This solution basically consists of a correlator, a moving sum and a peak detector. The stability of the generated frame-clock is improved significantly by averaging over a few number of frames. Simulations show that this low-complex, averaging method can be used to synchronize an OFDM system on twisted pair copper wires and in slowly fading radio channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1995.497156","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC '95 - 4th IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3577/10689/00497156.pdf","startPage":"982","endPage":"986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1995.497156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complex frame synchronization in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=497156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497156/","displayDocTitle":"Low-complex frame synchronization in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5296973","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complex frame synchronization in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00497156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03526S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3577","citationCount":"130","articleId":"497156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":497174,"authors":[{"name":"E.R.

The measurements can be done with about a hundred metal atoms per CCD. This gives a sensitivity of 10/sup 7/ atoms per cm/sup 3/, which is very high compared with other measurement methods like DLTS (requiring more than 10/sup 10/ atoms per cm/sup 3/).

Numerical experiences on the convergence behaviour of the non-gauged vector potential formulation (curl curl equation) are reported.

The system converges if the matrix equation is compatible, i.e. if the RHS is in the range of the curl-curl matrix. The compatibility is ensured when the current density is expressed by the curl of a source field (vector potential) and when this source field is projected on the space curl W/sup 1/, where W/sup 1/ is the space of the Whitney edge element. An explanation of the convergence behaviour is given through the analysis of the matrix structure: under the condition of the compatibility, the curl-curl equation is implicitly ganged by an iterative solver.","doi":"10.1109/20.497323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/10597/00497323.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.497323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of the RHS on the convergence behaviour of the curl-curl equation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=497323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497323/","displayDocTitle":"Influence of the RHS on the convergence behaviour of the curl-curl equation","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5283228","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of the RHS on the convergence behaviour of the curl-curl equation","sourcePdf":"00497323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024342S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"94","articleId":"497323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":497324,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The feature of the method is to adopt double nodes for the electric scalar potential /spl phi/ at slits, but not to the magnetic vector potential A. Adopting this technique, slits are equivalent to current barriers that have infinitesimal width. Some numerical results, which show the validity of the proposed method, are also presented.

Therefore, the numerical simulation of the power absorbed in human tissue becomes extremely important in order to avoid thermal destruction. A typical example is the strong interaction between the near field of a receiving antenna of a hand held transceiver and the sensitive organs on the head, like the eyes. A finite element formulation is given for calculating 3D electromagnetic scattering problems. The influence of a dipole excited field on low conducting materials situated very close to the antenna is discussed. The backscattering from the conducting object to the antenna can be treated as well. Along the far boundaries of the computational domain, absorbing boundary conditions of second order have been prescribed in order to avoid non-physical reflections. The formulation described is assessed by applying it to a special problem and the solution obtained is compared with a boundary element calculation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/10597/00497377.pdf","startPage":"862","endPage":"865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.497377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.497377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10597","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=497377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of antenna near field reactions on low conducting materials using the finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Humans","Frequency","Electromagnetic fields","Numerical simulation","Receiving antennas","Transceivers","Sense organs","Eyes","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave scattering","antenna radiation patterns","finite element analysis","conducting materials","electrical engineering computing","electrical engineering","boundary-elements methods","biological effects of fields","transceivers","receiving antennas","mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low conducting materials","finite element method","antenna near field reactions","3D electromagnetic scattering problems","dipole excited field","backscattering","conducting object","computational domain","second order absorbing boundary conditions","boundary element calculation","mobile telecommunications systems","high frequency range","human body","electromagnetic fields","numerical simulation","absorbed power","human tissue","receiving antenna","hand held transceiver","head","eyes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of antenna near field reactions on low conducting materials using the finite element method","volume":"32","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5283280","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of antenna near field reactions on low conducting materials using the finite element method","sourcePdf":"00497377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033704S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"497377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":497383,"authors":[{"name":"C.T.M.

Here it is applied to electromagnetic wave problems. A key feature of the method is that it uses a change of dependent variable to remove the wave-like qualities of the solution and thereby permits the use of arbitrarily large elements in the exterior domain. This makes it possible to apply to wave problems some of the techniques developed for magnetostatics, such as transformation methods. These methods map the very large exterior domain into a smaller region which is more easily meshed. The combined wave-envelope transformation method is applied to two time-harmonic electromagnetic wave problems: radiation of a single cylindrical wave function; and scattering of an incident plane wave by a perfectly-conducting circular cylinder. In both cases the near-zone electric field is compared to the exact solution, for a range of frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/20.497383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/10597/00497383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.497383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10597","startPage":"886","endPage":"889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wave-envelope and transformation methods for finite element solution of unbounded electromagnetic wave problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=497383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wave-envelope and transformation methods for finite element solution of unbounded electromagnetic wave problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5283286","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave-envelope and transformation methods for finite element solution of unbounded electromagnetic wave problems","sourcePdf":"00497383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048931S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","articleId":"497383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":497385,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For improved accuracy and due to the different character of the approximated unknown variables, two appropriate solution spaces are considered: a vectorial space using first-order, edge-based finite elements for analysis of the vectorial characteristics of the magnetic field and eddy-current distributions; and a scalar space using first-order nodal finite elements for the non-linear analysis of thermal field distribution. Separate 3-D mesh divisions are developed for accurate eddy-current and thermal field analysis. Time-dependent thermal field distribution is obtained using the Crank-Nicolson recurrence formula, and a moving conductor with eddy-current flow is considered using appropriate step division for the nature of the coupling process.

Some procedures apt to carry out principal component analysis (PCA) by using suitable artificial neural network (ANN) models are presented. The related models allow one to adaptively extract the PCs directly from the input data without estimating in advance the covariance matrix over the sample database.

In this study as well as calculating the electromagnetic field at any point in space (ground and air), we pay particular attention to variation with frequency of the impedance of a grounding system. Suggested modelling takes into account eddy currents in buried conductors and ground and non-linear phenomena (ionization of the ground) around the buried conductors when high currents flow via the earth. It also deals with displacement currents when their effect becomes noticeable in the earth for high frequency. The interest of this work lies in data needed to implement an optimal grounding system in non-homogeneous media. All the results of calculations are compared with measurements made by the French Electricity Board (E.D.F., France).","doi":"10.1109/20.497536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.497536","endPage":"1512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/10597/00497536.pdf","startPage":"1509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculating the impedance of a grounding system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497536/","displayDocTitle":"Calculating the impedance of a grounding system","volume":"32","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5288341","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculating the impedance of a grounding system","sourcePdf":"00497536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030192S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"10597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"38","articleId":"497536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":497541,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Due to repeated and potentially faulty usage by many clients, such software \"ages\" with time and eventually fails. (Huang et al., 1995) proposed a technique called \"software rejuvenation\" in which the software is periodically stopped and then restarted in a \"robust\" state after proper maintenance. This \"renewal\" of software prevents (or at least postpones) the crash failure. As the time lost (or the cost incurred) due to the software failure is typically more than the time lost (or the cost incurred) due to rejuvenation, the technique reduces the expected unavailability of the software. We present a quantitative analysis of software rejuvenation. The behavior of the system is represented through a Markov Regenerative Stochastic Petri Net (MRSPN) model which is solved both for steady state as well as transient conditions. We provide a closed-form analytical solution for the steady state expected down time (and the expected cost incurred) due to system unavailability. We also evaluate the optimal rejuvenation interval which minimizes the expected unavailability of the software.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Sixth International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering.

This paper describes a method for evaluating harmonic stray losses in nonskewed induction motors. The model used by the authors couples the finite element electromagnetic equations with external electrical circuit equations. The sets of equations are solved by discretizing the time at short intervals in conjunction with the motion of the rotor mesh. With Fourier series analysis, the time harmonics of the fields are then obtained. The harmonic stray losses are subsequently evaluated according to the distribution of the harmonic fields. The results obtained, by using a computer program being developed, produces results which have very good correlation with test data. To reduce CPU time, an adaptive time stepping method was explored in the developed software. A new method to estimate the local truncation error at each time step is also presented in this paper. The method presented in this paper not only needs no extra CPU time, but the accuracy of the solution is also improved.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950841","publicationTitle":"1995 Seventh International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

In the paper particular attention is focused on determining an influence of nonsymmetrical air-gap on the flux spectrum. An improved method of frequency analysis is discussed. This method consists of taking into account only the most essential factors having an effect on the value and characteristics of axial flux. In the presented description, only two the lowest harmonics of air-gap permeance are taken into account. They create together with the fundamental harmonic of the field, supplementary electromagnetic couplings. Knowledge of these couplings makes it possible to distinguish frequency lines that occur as a result of static rotor eccentricity. Chosen test results are presented and certain problems concerning realisation of a diagnostic system are mentioned.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnostic characteristics of axial flux in an induction machine","publicationTitle":"1995 Seventh International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

The difficulties that exist in the connection are frequently overcome by the use of flexible couplings, which allow a limited degree of misalignment. A coupling is proposed which employs the Foucault (eddy current) principle of torque transmission by the controlled use of high energy-product, permanent magnets. The replacement of electromagnets by neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) permanent magnets has the potential to greatly simplify the eddy-current coupling (no electrical supply, electrical contacts, or controls are required). Hence, it is possible that a robust coupler can be produced with a good tolerance for both misalignment and shock loads. The cost of such a unit will depend on the judicious use of the expensive Ne-Fe-B magnets. This paper describes the construction and testing of the proposed permanent magnet coupler and makes recommendations for future developments and applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motors","Eddy currents","Permanent magnets","Torque","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","eddy currents","permanent magnets","torque","testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high efficiency","vibration tolerant coupler","high energy-product permanent magnets","alignment tolerant coupler","motor-load connection","flexible couplings","Foucault principle","eddy current coupling","torque transmission","Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets","robust coupler","misalignment loads","shock loads","neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets"]}],"doi":"10.1049/cp:19950869","publicationTitle":"1995 Seventh International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

With this decoupling, an induction motor can be controlled like a DC motor.

There is a strong need to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and statistics in this area.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950523","startPage":"24","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19950523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10614","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/3530/10614/00497785.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks and disputed authorship: new challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497785/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and disputed authorship: new challenges","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5211463","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and disputed authorship: new challenges","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"00497785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031547S","chronDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10614","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3530","citationCount":"4","articleId":"497785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":497788,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is not sufficient to produce output data from a network without any information as to the quality of that data. The quality of the output data from any given neural network for a given generalisation point is dependent on the following: (1) the representative nature of the original training data in relation to the scope of the problem domain; (2) the properties of the network training algorithm, and degree of training; (3) whether the generalisation point lies within the domain of validity of the network; (4) the density of training data in the region of the generalisation point; and (5) the quality of the training data in the region of the generalisation point. The first of these is outside the scope of this paper. The second point is a problem that should be well known to those working in the field and it is not our intention to cover general training and validation principles in this paper. We address the other three points raised above. Firstly we introduce each of the points in greater detail, outlining the pitfalls open to the unwary.

Work on such applications with these techniques, has identified a need for a reassessment of these alternative recognition systems with a view to establishing their relative merits. In this paper the three systems are compared for two test data sets, one identifying the response of the systems to varying fault severity, the other showing recognition of faults which are independent of load. It is shown that for the MLP and SOM, implementing multiple networks improved the recognition of faults of varying severity. Possibly of more importance, this technique provided a means of diagnosing combinations of faults. For faults produced under differing load conditions, it is shown that the data cannot be classified by the SOM, and the supervised training regimes of the HMM and MLP provide the only means of classifying the data. Improved recognition is obtained with the HMM, although it is believed that the spectral pre-emphasis which was carried out on the input data could have contributed to this fact, suggesting that implementation of such pre-processing for the artificial neural network architectures, may be beneficial.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950584","pdfPath":"/iel3/3530/10614/00497847.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"374","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19950584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing hidden Markov models with artificial neural network architectures for condition monitoring applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Comparing hidden Markov models with artificial neural network architectures for condition monitoring applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5211524","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing hidden Markov models with artificial neural network architectures for condition monitoring applications","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"00497847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05071S","chronDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10614","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3530","citationCount":"14","articleId":"497847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":497850,"authors":[{"name":"K.L.

The Kohonen neural network can identify similarities of system states in an unsupervised manner and form a self-organising feature map for the classification of security states of power systems with respect to contingency analysis. The voltage magnitude of each busbar and active power flow of transmission lines are chosen as input features which can represent the complete operating condition of a power system. Contingency selection and security evaluation can be achieved simultaneously in the new proposed method.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950587","startPage":"387","endPage":"392","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/3530/10614/00497850.pdf","publicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19950587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Kohonen self-organising neural network to static security assessment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Self-organizing feature maps","Unsupervised learning","Pattern classification","Power system planning","Power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organising feature maps","unsupervised learning","pattern classification","power system planning","power system security","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kohonen self organising neural network","static security assessment","static security analysis","control functions","modern energy management systems","contingency assessment","system state similarities","unsupervised manner","security state classification","power systems","contingency analysis","voltage magnitude","busbar","active power flow","transmission lines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Application of Kohonen self-organising neural network to static security assessment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1995","accessionNumber":"5211527","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Kohonen self-organising neural network to static security assessment","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"00497850.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024315S","chronDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10614","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3530","citationCount":"7","articleId":"497850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":497857,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

We review two existing approaches for assessing 'relevance' and 'sensitivity' of the network's input units, and introduce a new technique that automatically selects the more dominant inputs. In all three techniques, during training, the network recursively removes the input unit least affecting the error function until the performance drops significantly; the remaining input units are then retained as the most relevant. We test the three procedures on a data set with 180 inputs representing reduced-resolution spectra of six normal and tumour animal tissues. We compare the three methods in terms of the number of remaining units necessary for correct classification and their consistency of using different combinations of train/test sets and initial weights. We conclude that while our proposed algorithm produces a more consistent ranking of features, the number and ranking of significant features varies considerably depending on the algorithm used and the initial conditions and that to obtain the reliable feature subsets combinations of two or more algorithms could be used.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950599","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00497862.png","startPage":"454","endPage":"458","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/3530/10614/00497862.pdf","publicationTitle":"1995 Fourth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19950599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of relevant features in /sup 1/H MR tumour spectra using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical magnetic resonance imaging","Magnetic resonance spectroscopy","Nuclear magnetic resonance","Feature extraction","Biomedical image processing","Learning systems","Recurrent neural networks","Image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical NMR","NMR spectroscopy","feature extraction","medical image processing","performance evaluation","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relevant feature identification","MR tumour spectra","neural networks","tumour cell types","classification performance","metabolites","neural network training","error function","performance","reduced-resolution spectra","animal tissue","proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/497862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Identification of relevant features in /sup 1/H MR tumour spectra using neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1995","accessionNumber":"5211536","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of relevant features in /sup 1/H MR tumour spectra using neural networks","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"00497862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096961S","chronDate":"26-28 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10614","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3530","citationCount":"5","articleId":"497862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":497866,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

We assume that the network is connection oriented and enforces some admission control which ensures that the source traffic conforms to specified traffic characteristics. We concentrate on the class of rate-controlled service (RCS) disciplines, in which traffic from each connection is reshaped at every hop, and develop end-to-end delay bounds for the general case where different reshapers are used at each hop. In addition, we establish that these bounds can also be achieved when the shapers at each hop have the same \"minimal\" envelope. The main disadvantage of this class of service disciplines is that the end-to-end delay guarantees are obtained as the sum of the worst case delays at each node, but we show that this problem can be alleviated through \"proper\" reshaping of the traffic. We illustrate the impact of this reshaping by demonstrating its use in designing RCS disciplines that outperform generalized processor sharing-based service disciplines.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

The behavior of an LR scheduler is determined by two parameters-the latency and the allocated rate. We show that several well-known scheduling algorithms, such as weighted fair queueing, virtualclock, self-clocked fair queueing, weighted round robin, and deficit round robin, belong to the class of LR-servers. We derive tight upper bounds on the end-to-end delay, internal burstiness, and buffer requirements of individual sessions in an arbitrary network of LR-servers in terms of the latencies of the individual schedulers in the network, when the session traffic is shaped by a leaky bucket. Thus, the theory of LR-servers enables computation of tight upper-bounds on end-to-end delay and buffer requirements in a network of servers in which the servers on a path may not all use the same scheduling algorithm. We also define a self-contained approach to evaluate the fairness of LR-servers and use it to compare the fairness of many well-known scheduling algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.497884","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

The former property is the basis for supporting guaranteed service traffic while the later property is important for supporting best-effort service traffic. Since GPS uses an idealized fluid model which cannot be realized in the real world, various packet approximation algorithms of the GPS have been proposed. Among these, weighted fair queueing (WFQ) also known as packet generalized processor sharing (PGPS) has been considered to be the best one in terms of accuracy. In particular, it has been proven that the delay bound provided by WFQ is within one packet transmission time of that provided by GPS. We show that, contrary to popular belief there could be large discrepancies between the services provided by the packet WFQ system and the fluid GPS system. We argue that such a discrepancy will adversely effect many congestion control algorithms that rely on services similar to those provided by GPS. A new packet approximation algorithm of GPS called worst-case fair weighted fair queueing (WF/sup 2/Q) is proposed. The service provided by WF/sup 2/Q is almost identical to that of GPS, differing no more than one maximum size packet.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WF/sup 2/Q: worst-case fair weighted fair queueing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

The proposed routing scheme is intended for bidirectional networks-with four incoming and four outgoing links per switch. In terms of average performance measures, our method performs no worse than the best local routing schemes, when the offered load is light or moderate. Unlike other deflection schemes proposed for MSN, our method is inherently asynchronous. This simplifies the switch design and eliminates some problems with the original synchronous approach, like the need to account for slight discrepancies in transmission rates of different switches.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.497891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10628","startPage":"172","endPage":"179 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel2/3539/10628/00497891.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

From an application's point of view, this service amounts in practice to providing channels with time-varying characteristics such as delay and loss distributions. One way to support real time applications such as interactive audio given this service is to use control mechanisms that adapt the audio coding and decoding processes based on the characteristics of the channels, the goal being to maximize the quality of the audio delivered to the destinations. In this paper, we describe and analyze a set of such control mechanisms. They include a jitter control mechanism and a combined error and rate control mechanism. These mechanisms have been implemented and evaluated over the Internet and the MBone. Experiments indicate that they make it possible to establish and maintain reasonable quality audioconferences even across fairly congested connections.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.497898","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

Under certain conditions, the throughput can be shown to be limited to approximately 58%. It is also known that if non-FIFO queueing policies are used, the throughput can be increased. However it has not been previously shown that if a suitable queueing policy and scheduling algorithm are used then it is possible to achieve 100% throughput for all independent arrival processes. In this paper we prove this to be the case using a simple linear programming argument and quadratic Lyapunov function. In particular we assume that each input maintains a separate FIFO queue for each output and that the switch is scheduled using a maximum weight bipartite matching algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

We first establish that the problem of determining such a constrained tree is NP-complete. We then derive heuristics that demonstrate good average case behavior in terms of the maximum inter-destination delay variation of the final tree. We also show how to dynamically reorganize the initial tree in response to changes in the destination set, in a way that is minimally disruptive to the multicast session.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1996.497913","startPage":"353","endPage":"360 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '96.

The receiver design is based on a low gate-leakage InAlAs-InGaAs-InP heterostructure field effect transistor (HFET). The noise modeling of these devices is done using an extended temperature noise model in order to produce a reliable extrapolation far beyond the frequency limits of common measurement setups. The fitted transistor model shows excellent agreement with measured data concerning RF as well as the noise performance. The evidence of inductive peaking near the corner frequency of the transimpedance Z_/sub T/ is correlated to a phase difference between the voltage gain V_/sub u/ and Z_/sub T/ itself. Furthermore, the distinct influence of the length of the feedback line on the receiver performance is discussed. Based on 0.7 /spl mu/m gate HFETs produced by optical lithography and offering a current gain cut off frequency of f/sub T/=40 GHz the following receiver features can be predicted: low frequency transimpedance Z_/sub T0/=39.4 dB/spl Omega/, corner frequency f/sub 3dB/=22 GHz, mean equivalent input noise current density i~/sub na//spl ap/43 pA//spl radic/Hz.

This achieves both the spreading in bandwidth of the data and a powerful coding strategy within the output state of the convolutional shift register system, which maximises the number of simultaneous CDMA channels. In order to achieve orthogonality, Hadamard codes are incorporated within the convolutional coding strategy. The effects of using such a design within a DS-CDMA system are studied and the results show a direct increase in the capacity of the cellular system compared with a DS-CDMA using maximal length sequences. The importance of randomising the output symbols from the Hadamard encoder is also considered with respect to the spectral characteristics of the transmitted signal and the isolation between different simultaneously transmitting users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimisation of orthogonal low-rate convolutional codes in a DS-CDMA system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSE'95 - International Symposium on Signals, Systems and Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISSSE.1995.498039","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSE'95 - International Symposium on Signals, Systems and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/3556/10650/00498039.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.1995.498039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=498039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/498039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimisation of orthogonal low-rate convolutional codes in a DS-CDMA system","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimisation of orthogonal low-rate convolutional codes in a DS-CDMA system","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00498039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04724S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct 1995","isNumber":"10650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3556","citationCount":"3","articleId":"498039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":498041,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Our approach is based on an unsupervised learning scheme where the samples are first divided into separate clusters, and each cluster is then coded as a single vector. These Bayesian prototype vectors consist of conditional probabilities representing the attribute-value distribution inside the corresponding cluster. Using these prototype vectors, it is possible to model the underlying joint probability distribution as a simple Bayesian network (a tree), which can be realized as a feedforward neural network capable of probabilistic reasoning. We describe how the prototypes can be determined, given a partition of the samples, and present a method for evaluating the likelihood of the corresponding Bayesian tree. We also present a greedy heuristic for searching through the space of different partition schemes with different numbers of clusters, aiming at an optimal approximation of the probability distribution.","doi":"10.1109/SOUTHC.1994.498076","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record Southcon","pdfPath":"/iel2/3537/10626/00498076.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record Southcon","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOUTHC.1994.498076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning in neural networks with Bayesian prototypes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Bayesian methods","Prototypes","Probability distribution","Feedforward neural networks","Vectors","Computer architecture","Multi-layer neural network","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","unsupervised learning","probability","inference mechanisms","Bayes methods","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability distribution","discrete random variables","neural network model","unsupervised learning","cluster","Bayesian prototype vectors","feedforward neural network","probabilistic reasoning","Bayesian tree","greedy heuristic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/498076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 March 1994","displayDocTitle":"Learning in neural networks with Bayesian prototypes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29-31 March 1994","accessionNumber":"5296440","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning in neural networks with Bayesian prototypes","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00498076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031953S","chronDate":"29-31 March 1994","isNumber":"10626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3537","citationCount":"1","articleId":"498076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":498080,"authors":[{"name":"W.S.

The structure of the stochastic model of network dynamics, reflected in these recursive conditions, strongly parallels the recursive structure found in backpropagation (BP) neural networks. This structural resemblance has suggested the use of variations of the BP approach to compute solutions to the recursive mathematical conditions.

The NiCd-battery system has been well established for more than 4 decades since the introduction into the market by VARTA with the first main application, the pocket-light. Now this system can be substituted in certain applications by a system not using cadmium as an electrode material: The NiMH-battery. This favours the environment because if these new batteries are not returned when spent for recycling no cadmium can be exposed to the environment when disposed of in landfills with the normal household waste. The paper gives a comparison of design and performance data, information on life cycles, safety requirements, reliability, care and handling. Economical and ecological aspects are mentioned such as return and recycling requirements. The outlook on further possible developments are given.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.1995.499044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10697","startPage":"758","endPage":"765","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INTELEC 95. 17th International Telecommunications Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3585/10697/00499044.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portable NiCd- and Ni-MH-batteries for telecom applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Portable NiCd- and Ni-MH-batteries for telecom applications","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5255569","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Portable NiCd- and Ni-MH-batteries for telecom applications","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00499044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03713S","chronDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3585","citationCount":"6","articleId":"499044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":499048,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The distribution of the energy among the allowed modes is independent of the overall intensity, thereby giving another depth of multiplexing in addition to common schemes such as intensify and frequency modulation, polarization, and wavelength-division multiplexing, etc. We present an optical interconnection scheme by which the intensity carries the data and the spatial coherence conveys the address information on the same beam.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499143.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of First International Caracas Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3592/10707/00499143.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of First International Caracas Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCDCS.1995.499143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCDCS.1995.499143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial mode modulation of laser beams for optical communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical modulation","Laser modes","Laser beams","Optical beams","Optical fiber communication","Spatial coherence","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical interferometry","Optical transmitters","Optical propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-optical modulation","laser beams","laser beam applications","multiplexing","optical communication","laser modes","optical interconnections","optical waveguides","light interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial mode modulation","laser beams","optical communication","spatial modes","spatial coherence","interferometer detector","electric-optic device transmitter","multiplexing","optical interconnection scheme","free-space communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Spatial mode modulation of laser beams for optical communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5374882","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial mode modulation of laser beams for optical communication","confLoc":"Caracas, Venezuela","sourcePdf":"00499143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041456S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3592","citationCount":"1","articleId":"499143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":499184,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Abundant hot electrons can be generated from the high field near drain together with various \"seed\" currents for avalanche mechanism, such as punch-through and parasitic bipolar currents in cell. The programmed cell V/sub T/ has excellent linear relation to the gate bias used for programming, therefore this technique is also useful for storing analog signals in cells. Many array architectures, such as NVG or ETOX, can be implemented with capability of programming one or more entire columns of cells into multi-levels or analog signals simultaneously.

Under these bias conditions, a larger band-gap, enhanced dielectric screening, and reduced high-energy tails in the distribution function at the source cause a reduction of impact ionization at lower lattice temperatures.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1995.499202","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/3584/10696/00499202.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"308","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499202.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1995.499202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo study of sub-band-gap impact ionization in small silicon field-effect transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499202/","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo study of sub-band-gap impact ionization in small silicon field-effect transistors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5237218","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo study of sub-band-gap impact ionization in small silicon field-effect transistors","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00499202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076909S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3584","citationCount":"45","articleId":"499202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":499228,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, an attempt is made to leverage this improved short channel behaviour and thereby improve transistor performance (as measured by the current drive). Whereas significant improvements in short channel effects measured by DIBL and /spl Delta/Vt/sub sat/ are obtained with retrograde channels, it is observed that for a fixed gate length and equal threshold voltage, transistors with retrograde channel profiles typically exhibit lower drive currents than equivalent transistors fabricated with conventional doping profiles.

The amplifiers are designed for operation at moderate current densities to reduce junction temperature and to improve reliability. State-of-the-art performances with maximum output powers of 9 W with a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 42 % and peak power-added efficiencies of 45 % have been achieved at 10 GHz under critical long pulse conditions (pulse width=100 /spl mu/s, duty cycle=10 %).

The layout was designed for a half-pitch 8F/sup 2/ cell with 0.14-/spl mu/m process technology, which is promising for 1-gigabit DRAMs and beyond. We developed three advanced technologies for this fabrication. Firstly, synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray lithography was used to replicate ultra-fine patterns instead of optical lithography. Secondly, we introduced a simple stacked capacitor composed of a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) grown (Ba,Sr)TiO/sub 3/ (BST) high-dielectric-constant film sandwiched by Ru-metal electrodes. Thirdly, we developed advanced etching techniques for the fine pattern fabrication using improved ECR discharged plasmas, which give less microloading effects.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1995.499362","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499362.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/3584/10696/00499362.pdf","startPage":"903","endPage":"906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1995.499362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Giga-bit scale DRAM cell with new simple Ru/(Ba,Sr)TiO/sub 3//Ru stacked capacitors using X-ray lithography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Giga-bit scale DRAM cell with new simple Ru/(Ba,Sr)TiO/sub 3//Ru stacked capacitors using X-ray lithography","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5241838","publicationDate":"1995","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Giga-bit scale DRAM cell with new simple Ru/(Ba,Sr)TiO/sub 3//Ru stacked capacitors using X-ray lithography","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00499362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053757S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3584","citationCount":"15","articleId":"499362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":499363,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.

So far, the well concentration has been optimized from the viewpoint of the scaling of the transistor dimensions. However, it has been found that the DRAM retention time strongly depends on the well concentration. Increase of the well concentration enhances thermionic field emission (TFE) current from the storage node. This leakage current makes \"tail distribution\" of the retention time.

Unfortunately, application of integrated inductors is hampered by a lack of design tools, and also useful models for how inductor properties vary with layout and how the inductor interacts with its environment. We discuss these issues and also analyze what we believe to be the optimal inductor layout for an unspecialized multi-layer metal submicron CMOS process.

Writing is achieved by channel initiated secondary electron injection, which permits writing for qV/sub DS/ below the 3.2 eV oxide barrier. Writing times of 1 ms are achieved for floating gate voltages V/sub FG/ as low as 1.2 V, with V/sub DS/=-V/sub BS/=2.5 V, voltages which can easily be derived from a single scaled power supply, the back-gate bias generated by low-current charge pumping. No high voltage transistors are required for writing or V/sub T/ convergence. Moreover, because the devices are based on a fully scaled 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS process, NV-memory arrays can be easily integrated with a minimum of additional process steps. Tight V/sub T/ convergence together with low voltage operation and scaling compatibility makes them ideal candidates for Giga-bit Flash.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/3584/10696/00499382.pdf","startPage":"989","endPage":"992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEPROM/flash sub 3.0 V drain-source bias hot carrier writing","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1995.499382","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499382.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1995.499382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"EEPROM/flash sub 3.0 V drain-source bias hot carrier writing","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5248920","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEPROM/flash sub 3.0 V drain-source bias hot carrier writing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00499382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.01894S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3584","citationCount":"31","articleId":"499382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":499384,"authors":[{"name":"D.D.

The basic storage element is a thin-film stripe that consists of a pair of 9-nm ferromagnetic (NiFe) layers spaced with 2.2-2.5 nm of non-magnetic Cu film. The magnetization, M, of one of the layers is pinned along the longitudinal direction of the stripe with an antiferromagnetic material (FeMn), while the M of the other layer is free to rotate. This structure is known as a spin valve. When the Ms of the pair are in the same (parallel) direction, the resistance is lower than when they are in the opposite (anti-parallel) direction by 5-8%. This property is well known as the giant magneto-resistive effect. The memory cell is made up of a storage resistor stripe and the x/y select wires, typically 100 nm thick. The current pulses in the select wires generate a vector sum of magnetic field that switches the cell state. The switching field in the longitudinal direction is lowered when a transverse field is applied. The memory cells were fabricated on thermal oxide on silicon wafers. The sputter deposition and etch process of the spin valve does not affect the leakage nor does it alter the Vt of FETs, and thus may be integrated into the metallization steps of the silicon wafer processing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1995.499384","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1995.499384","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/3584/10696/00499384.pdf","startPage":"997","endPage":"1000","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Electron Devices Meeting","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499384.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IC process compatible nonvolatile magnetic RAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An IC process compatible nonvolatile magnetic RAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5248922","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IC process compatible nonvolatile magnetic RAM","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00499384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066087S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3584","citationCount":"9","articleId":"499384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":499427,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed rule extraction is based solely on data, i.e., without initial theories and preprocessing. To evaluate its effectiveness, SLF as well as BP learning and ID3 are applied to a classification of mushrooms, a MONKS problem and a promotor recognition in DNA sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ANNES.1995.499427","pdfPath":"/iel3/3597/10712/00499427.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Second New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Second New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499427.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANNES.1995.499427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks approach to rule extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks approach to rule extraction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5242799","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks approach to rule extraction","confLoc":"Dunedin, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"00499427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036481S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3597","citationCount":"5","articleId":"499427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":499430,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By computer simulation, the validity of the proposed methods has been illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/ANNES.1995.499435","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499435.png","startPage":"42","endPage":"44","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Second New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3597/10712/00499435.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Second New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANNES.1995.499435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error estimation and error bounds for neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Neural networks","Physics","Indium phosphide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","maximum likelihood estimation","learning (artificial intelligence)","error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error estimation","error bounds","neural networks","predicted values","multilayer perceptron","likelihood theory","feedforward networks","perturbed weights","analog network","digital network","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Error estimation and error bounds for neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5242807","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error estimation and error bounds for neural networks","confLoc":"Dunedin, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"00499435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032419S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3597","articleId":"499435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":499436,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Neural network approaches to cognitive mapping are as varied as their non-neural network counterparts and range from models which use the network to model the physiology of the brain to models which are merely an abstraction of some aspect of cognitive mapping behaviour.

By adopting a redundant binary multiplier and a variable pipeline structure, this DSP's MAC unit, compared to a conventional MAC unit, consumes about 15% less power and operates 24% faster. Furthermore, its double-speed MAC mechanism can realize twice the performance of a single MAC operation while consuming only 69% more power. By being able to more finely control which portions of memory are activated, the data ROM and data RAM's precharge current was reduced to about 1/8 of the conventional ROM and RAMs. We redesigned the instruction set and reduced its width from 32 b to 24 b based on the analysis of data generated by simulating an application program on our previous DSP. The reduction in instruction width made our on-chip instruction memory size 33% smaller than the previous one. This chip is fabricated with a 0.5-/spl mu/m double-metal-layer CMOS process and achieves 80-MOPS-peak double speed multiply-accumulate performance.","doi":"10.1109/4.499725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"494","endPage":"503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/10804/00499725.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499725.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.499725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 80-MOPS-peak high-speed and low-power-consumption 16-b digital signal processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processors","Digital signal processing","Energy consumption","Random access memory","Read only memory","Digital signal processing chips","Frequency","Circuits","CMOS process","Telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","instruction sets","multiplying circuits","pipeline processing","CMOS digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","fixed point digital signal processor","multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit","instruction set","redundant binary multiplier","variable pipeline structure","double-speed MAC mechanism","precharge current","double-metal-layer CMOS process","16 bit","0.5 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"An 80-MOPS-peak high-speed and low-power-consumption 16-b digital signal processor","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5288149","publicationDate":"April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499725/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 80-MOPS-peak high-speed and low-power-consumption 16-b digital signal processor","sourcePdf":"499725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096782S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","articleId":"499725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":499726,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The 256 Mb DRAM consists of sixteen 16 Mb units, each containing one 128 Kb row redundancy block. This row redundancy block architecture allows flexible row redundancy replacement, where random faults, clustered faults, and grouped faults can be efficiently repaired. Flexible column redundancy replacement with interchangeable master DQ's (MDQ) is used to allow a 256 b data compression without causing a data conflict, while improving the column access speed by 2 ns. A depletion NMOS bitline-precharge-current-limiter suppresses the current flow which occurs as a result of a wordline-bitline short-circuit to only 15 /spl mu/A per cross fail, avoiding a standby current fail. Consequently, the hardware results show a significant yield enhancement of 16 times relative to the intra-block/segment replacement. Detailed simulation results show that this 256 Mb DRAM allows 275 random faults to be repaired with 5.5% silicon area overhead for 80% chip yield.","doi":"10.1109/4.499733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/10804/00499733.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.499733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant designs for 256 Mb DRAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant designs for 256 Mb DRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499733/","publicationDate":"April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5288157","volume":"31","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant designs for 256 Mb DRAM","sourcePdf":"499733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041578S","chronDate":"Apr 1996","isNumber":"10804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"30","articleId":"499733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":499734,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper describes a new array architecture, \"A double-level-V/sub th/ select gate array architecture\" to eliminate the array noise, together with a reduction of the cell area. The array noise is mainly caused by interbitline capacitive coupling noise and by the high resistance of the diffused source-line. The threshold voltage fluctuation can be as much as 0.7 V in a conventional array. In the proposed array, bitlines are alternately selected, and the unselected bitlines are used as low resistance source-lines. Moreover, the unselected bitlines form a shield between the neighboring selected bitlines. As a result, the array noise is strongly suppressed.

The Earth surface temperature is a relevant parameter for climatology, meteorology, oceanography, fire mapping, wind field determination, and energy balance at the atmosphere-Earth interface. In addition, ground emissivity is very important for lithological mapping, geological inspection, petrography, the dating of lava flows, etc. A new method for emissivity and temperature retrieval has been developed in the authors' laboratory which is based on the assumption that emissivity is a slowly varying function of wavelength. It is shown that this assumption holds true for many kinds of natural targets. The resulting model is called \"grey body emissivity\", and may be used to retrieve the emissivity of soils and other natural materials. The problem with using an effective wavelength or a bandwidth integral in order to represent the sampled radiance is discussed, thus leading to the implementation of two algorithms for the grey body emissivity. It is demonstrated that one of them, extensively discussed throughout the paper, provides the maximum likelihood values for temperature and emissivity. The other reveals two drawbacks: it produces noisy processed images and works well only for target temperatures greater than 274 K. Comparisons with other models are carried out utilizing remotely sensed images, laboratory measurements, and numerical simulations. The main approximations and the resulting errors, contained in the considered models, are briefly discussed. The influence of the atmospheric effects on utilized remote sensing data is taken into account. Finally, the authors investigate the emissivity dependence on the viewing angle. Theoretical predictions which rely on Fresnel's and Kirchhoff's laws are compared with the emissivity maps extracted from TIMS images over sea. Starting from the image data alone, the procedure allows them to compute the refraction index and the absorption coefficient of the concerned marine water.","doi":"10.1109/36.499748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.499748","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/10808/00499748.pdf","startPage":"681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature and emissivity retrieval from remotely sensed images using the \"Grey body emissivity\" method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499748/","displayDocTitle":"Temperature and emissivity retrieval from remotely sensed images using the \"Grey body emissivity\" method","volume":"34","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5288476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature and emissivity retrieval from remotely sensed images using the \"Grey body emissivity\" method","sourcePdf":"00499748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113156S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"75","articleId":"499748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":499749,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It also resolves the Doppler ambiguity. Experiments show that the scheme works successfully over various terrain types, including land, water, and ice, and that it requires only a modest amount of SAR data to perform reliably. The proposed scheme has an added advantage that it is directly applicable to RADARSAT and ENVISAT ScanSAR data. The scheme uses two complementary Doppler estimation algorithms, both utilizing the phase information embedded in the radar signal. In each algorithm, upper and lower parts of the available bandwidth of the received signal are extracted to form two range looks. The first algorithm, called multilook cross correlation (MLCC), computes the average cross correlation coefficient between adjacent azimuth samples for each of the two looks and then takes the difference between the angles of the two coefficients. The Doppler ambiguity is determined from the angle difference. The fractional pulse repetition frequency (PRF) part is also determined from the cross correlation coefficients. In the second algorithm, called multilook beat frequency (MLBF), the two looks are multiplied together to generate a beat signal. The beat frequency is then estimated and the Doppler ambiguity determined from the beat frequency. The MLCC algorithm performs better with low contrast scenes while the MLBF works better with high contrast ones. Although each algorithm works well on its own with sufficient averaging, it is also possible to use quality measures to select the best result from either algorithm. In this way, scenes of different content or contrast can be handled reliably. This paper presents the analysis of the two algorithms, explaining why their performance is affected by scene contrast, which is confirmed by experimental results with ERS-1 and JERS-1 data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","volume":"34","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5288477","displayDocTitle":"A combined SAR Doppler centroid estimation scheme based upon signal phase","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combined SAR Doppler centroid estimation scheme based upon signal phase","sourcePdf":"00499749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037972S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"88","articleId":"499749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":499751,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Currently, the only practical method for solving the weighted least squares equations is a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) technique. In this paper the authors present a new method for weighted least squares phase unwrapping. Their method is a multigrid technique that solves the equations on smaller, coarser grids by means of Gauss-Seidel relaxation schemes and transfers the intermediate results to the finer grids. A key idea of their approach is to maintain the partial derivatives of the given phase data in separate arrays and to correct these derivatives at the boundaries of the coarser grids. This correction maintains the boundary conditions necessary for convergence to the correct solution. Another key idea of their approach is to transfer the weighting values to the coarser grids in a carefully defined manner. They also present methods for defining the initial phase weights in an automated fashion. The resulting multigrid algorithm converges in only one or two multigrid cycles and is generally 15-25 times faster than the PCG technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5288480","displayDocTitle":"Phase unwrapping by means of multigrid techniques for interferometric SAR","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase unwrapping by means of multigrid techniques for interferometric SAR","sourcePdf":"00499752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041498S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"178","articleId":"499752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":499755,"authors":[{"name":"C.N.

Feature selection techniques are employed to further increase classification performance. The artificial neural network feature selection techniques are complemented by a conventional decision boundary-based feature selection method. The results using the wavelet features are compared to more conventional measures of image texture, angular second moment, and Karhunen Loeve coefficients. The use of alternative signal processing to compare wavelet and neural techniques allows for a measure of the problem difficulty. It is concluded that advances and contributions have been made with the introduction of two novel feature extraction methods for breast cancer diagnosis, wavelets and eigenmasses. Additionally, feature selection techniques are demonstrated, compared, and validated, transforming adequate discrimination power into promising classification results.","doi":"10.1109/51.499766","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499766.png","startPage":"95","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.499766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10800","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/10800/00499766.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using neural networks to select wavelet features for breast cancer diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499766/","displayDocTitle":"Using neural networks to select wavelet features for breast cancer diagnosis","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5293355","publicationDate":"May-June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using neural networks to select wavelet features for breast cancer diagnosis","sourcePdf":"00499766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039825S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1996","isNumber":"10800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"29","articleId":"499766","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":499782,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

The data analyzed are from individual lines of a Landsat TM image (25-m sample interval) and include both reflective (channel 3, 30-m resolution) and thermal (channel 6, 120-m resolution) data. The wavelet variance and covariance estimates are presented and more than half of the variance is accounted for by scales of less than 800 m. A wavelet-based technique for enhancing the lower-resolution thermal data using the reflected data is introduced. The simulated effects of poor instrument resolution on the estimated lead number density and the mean lead width are investigated using a wavelet-based smooth of the observations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The discrete wavelet transform and the scale analysis of the surface properties of sea ice","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.499782","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/10808/00499782.pdf","startPage":"771","endPage":"787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.499782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"The discrete wavelet transform and the scale analysis of the surface properties of sea ice","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1996","accessionNumber":"5288484","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The discrete wavelet transform and the scale analysis of the surface properties of sea ice","sourcePdf":"00499782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04894S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"97","articleId":"499782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":499784,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The terrain covers include forest, water, bare soil, grass, and eight other types of crops. The radar response of crop types to frequency and polarization states were analyzed for classification based on three configurations: 1) multifrequency and single-polarization images; 2) single-frequency and multipolarization images; and 3) multifrequency and multipolarization images. A recently developed dynamic learning neural network was adopted as the classifier. Results show that using partial information, P-band multipolarization images and multiband hh polarization images have better classification accuracy, while with a full configuration, namely, multiband and multipolarization, gives the best discrimination capability. The overall accuracy using the proposed method can be as high as 95% with a total of thirteen cover types classified. Further reduction of the data volume by means of correlation analysis was conducted to single out the minimum data channels required. It was found that this method efficiently reduces the data volume while retaining highly acceptable classification accuracy.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/10808/00499786.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"820","doi":"10.1109/36.499786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.499786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of multifrequency polarimetric SAR imagery using a dynamic learning neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Classification of multifrequency polarimetric SAR imagery using a dynamic learning neural network","publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5288488","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of multifrequency polarimetric SAR imagery using a dynamic learning neural network","sourcePdf":"00499786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046981S","chronDate":"May 1996","isNumber":"10808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"111","articleId":"499786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":499791,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The paper focuses on two essential problems; one is the symbol grounding problem and the other is how the internal symbolic processes can be situated with respect to the behavioral contexts. We investigate these problems by applying a dynamical system's approach to the robot navigation learning problem. Our formulation, based on a forward modeling scheme using recurrent neural learning, shows that the robot is capable of learning grammatical structure hidden in the geometry of the workspace from the local sensory inputs through its navigational experiences. Furthermore, the robot is capable of generating diverse action plans to reach an arbitrary goal using the acquired forward model which incorporates chaotic dynamics. The essential claim is that the internal symbolic process, being embedded in the attractor, is grounded since it is self-organized solely through interaction with the physical world. It is also shown that structural stability arises in the interaction between the neural dynamics and the environmental dynamics, which accounts for the situatedness of the internal symbolic process, The experimental results using a mobile robot, equipped with a local sensor consisting of a laser range finder, verify our claims.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5276398","pubMedId":"18263044","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Model-based learning for mobile robot navigation from the dynamical systems perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based learning for mobile robot navigation from the dynamical systems perspective","sourcePdf":"00499793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041379S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"10822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"212","articleId":"499793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":499794,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Given an initial estimate of its position (perhaps based on dead-reckoning) and an image taken of a known environment, our agent first attempts to locate a set of landmarks (real-world objects at known locations), then uses their angular separation to obtain an improved estimate of its current position. Unfortunately, some landmarks may not be visible, or worse, may be confused with other landmarks, resulting in both time wasted in searching for the undetected landmarks, and in further errors in the agent's estimate of its position. To address these problems, we propose a method that uses previous experiences to learn a selection function that, given the set of landmarks that might be visible, returns the subset that can be used to reliably provide an accurate registration of the agent's position. We use statistical techniques to prove that the learned selection function is, with high probability, effectively at a local optimum in the space of such functions. This paper also presents empirical evidence, using real-world data, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.499794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel1/3477/10822/00499794.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"449","doi":"10.1109/3477.499794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to select useful landmarks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","displayDocTitle":"Learning to select useful landmarks","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5276399","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18263045","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to select useful landmarks","sourcePdf":"00499794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066868S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"10822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"28","articleId":"499794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":499795,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper focuses on an intermediate step in this incremental process, where the appropriate means of providing guidance to adapting controllers is explored. A local and a global method of reinforcement learning are contrasted-a special form of back-propagation and an evolutionary algorithm. These methods are applied to a neural network controller for a simple robot. A number of experiments are described where the presence of explicit goals and the immediacy of reinforcement are varied. These experiments reveal how various types of guidance can affect the final control behavior. The results show that the respective advantages and disadvantages of these two adaptation methods are complementary, suggesting that some hybrid of the two may be the most effective method. Concluding remarks discuss the next incremental steps toward more complex control behaviors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5276402","pubMedId":"18263048","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An incremental approach to developing intelligent neural network controllers for robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An incremental approach to developing intelligent neural network controllers for robots","sourcePdf":"00499797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093969S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"10822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"38","articleId":"499797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":499798,"authors":[{"name":"P.

After an initial learning phase, the controller can move the robot to an arbitrary stationary or moving target while compensating for noise and other forms of disturbance, such as wheel slippage or changes in the robot's plant. In addition, the forward odometric map allows the robot to reach targets in the absence of sensory feedback. The controller is also able to adapt in response to long-term changes in the robot's plant, such as a change in the radius of the wheels. In this article we review the NETMORC architecture and describe its simplified algorithmic implementation, we present new, quantitative results on NETMORC's performance and adaptability under noise-free and noisy conditions, we compare NETMORC's performance on a trajectory-following task with the performance of an alternative controller, and we describe preliminary results on the hardware implementation of NETMORC with the mobile robot ROBUTER.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unsupervised neural network for low-level control of a wheeled mobile robot: noise resistance, stability, and hardware implementation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/3477.499798","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel1/3477/10822/00499798.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"496","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499798.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.499798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10822","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","displayDocTitle":"An unsupervised neural network for low-level control of a wheeled mobile robot: noise resistance, stability, and hardware implementation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5276403","pubMedId":"18263049","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unsupervised neural network for low-level control of a wheeled mobile robot: noise resistance, stability, and hardware implementation","sourcePdf":"00499798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073548S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"10822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"16","articleId":"499798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":499813,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

These approaches have been individually successful but are limited to only a single subprocess within a data fusion system. At The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, a general-purpose fuzzy-logic architecture has been developed that provides for control of sensing resources, fusion of data for tracking, automatic object recognition, control of system resources and elements, and automated situation assessment. This general architecture has been applied to implement an autonomous vehicle capable of self-direction, obstacle avoidance, and mission completion. The fuzzy logic architecture provides interpretation and fusion of multisensor data (i.e., perception) as well as logic for process control (action).

The authors start by recognizing the fact that signal interpretation is attributed much to a human expert's domain-specific, pattern-perceiving capability of grasping raw signals by structured representations having multiple levels of abstraction, rather than to some objectively defined knowledge. In other words, that is an emergent or self-organizing process, where information is regarded as perceptual as opposed to objectively defined. First, they attempt to organize such structured representations by usage of a hierarchical clustering method of data analysis. Then, based on these representations they model a human expert's interpretation skill as an activity of searching for an optimum combination of those perceptual units within that structured representation space being constrained by the data. In order to implement this activity, they introduce a genetic algorithm and apply it to the structured representation space assimilating a human analyst's creative interpreting task in flexibly shifting the focal view of attention from the coarse to the precise. They implement a working system for signal understanding of the remote sensing data of seismic prospecting and show the results output by the system.","doi":"10.1109/41.499814","startPage":"411","endPage":"421","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/10857/00499814.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.499814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusing multiple data and knowledge sources for signal understanding by genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Humans","Machine intelligence","Intelligent robots","Pattern recognition","Clustering methods","Data analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","seismology","sensor fusion","data analysis","remote sensing","expert systems","artificial intelligence","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple data sources","knowledge source","signal understanding","genetic algorithm","data fusion","hierarchical clustering method","data analysis","human expert","interpretation skill","self-organizing process","structured representation space","creative interpreting task","seismic prospecting","remote sensing data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Fusing multiple data and knowledge sources for signal understanding by genetic algorithm","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5293224","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusing multiple data and knowledge sources for signal understanding by genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00499814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049272S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"6","articleId":"499814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":499826,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The control problem is determining how best to use the available degrees of freedom of a surgical robot to accomplish a particular task, while respecting geometric constraints on the work volume, robot mechanism, and the specific task requirements. We present a method of formulating desired motions as sets of task goals in any number of coordinate frames (task frames) relevant to the task, optionally subject to additional linear constraints in each of the task frames. Mathematically, the kinematic control problem is posed as a constrained quadratic optimization problem and is shown to be computable in real time on a PC. We will present experimental results of the application of this control methodology to both kinematically deficient and kinematically redundant robots. Specifically, we will discuss the control issues within the context of a representative set of tasks in robot-assisted laparoscopy, which includes (but is not limited to) teleoperated navigation of a laparoscopic camera attached to a surgical robot. A system based on this control formalism has been used in preclinical in vivo studies at the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center and the early experience with the system will be summarized.","doi":"10.1109/70.499826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/10865/00499826.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.499826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Cartesian motion control for teleoperated surgical robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Cartesian motion control for teleoperated surgical robots","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5301211","volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Cartesian motion control for teleoperated surgical robots","sourcePdf":"00499826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070373S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"96","articleId":"499826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":499834,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Signal Processing, vol.41, no.12, p.3445, 1993), is a very effective and computationally simple technique for image compression. We offer an alternative explanation of the principles of its operation, so that the reasons for its excellent performance can be better understood. These principles are partial ordering by magnitude with a set partitioning sorting algorithm, ordered bit plane transmission, and exploitation of self-similarity across different scales of an image wavelet transform. Moreover, we present a new and different implementation based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), which provides even better performance than our previously reported extension of EZW that surpassed the performance of the original EZW. The image coding results, calculated from actual file sizes and images reconstructed by the decoding algorithm, are either comparable to or surpass previous results obtained through much more sophisticated and computationally complex methods. In addition, the new coding and decoding procedures are extremely fast, and they can be made even faster, with only small loss in performance, by omitting entropy coding of the bit stream by the arithmetic code.","doi":"10.1109/76.499834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.499834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/10886/00499834.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new, fast, and efficient image codec based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"A new, fast, and efficient image codec based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees","volume":"6","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5295430","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499834/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new, fast, and efficient image codec based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees","sourcePdf":"00499834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043339S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"3715","articleId":"499834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":499836,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Hwan Jung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Changwon NatE28099l University, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Hwan Jung","id":"37087807778"},{"name":"S.K.

However, in low bit rate coding, it produces undesirable block artifacts that are visually not pleasing. In addition, in many practical applications, faster computation and easier VLSI implementation of DCT coefficients are also important issues. The removal of the block artifacts and faster DCT computation are therefore of practical interest. In this paper, we investigate a modified DCT computation scheme, to be called the subband DCT (SB-DCT), that provides a simple, efficient solution to the reduction of the block artifacts while achieving faster computation. We have applied the new approach for the low bit rate coding and decoding of images. Simulation results on real images have verified the improved performance obtained using the proposed method over the standard JPEG method.","doi":"10.1109/76.499836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/10886/00499836.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.499836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","displayDocTitle":"Subband DCT: definition, analysis, and applications","volume":"6","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5301479","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499836/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband DCT: definition, analysis, and applications","sourcePdf":"00499836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031626S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"10886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"47","articleId":"499836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":499837,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Yi Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Yi Lee","id":"37280413800"},{"name":"Shih-Chou Juan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Chou Juan","id":"37663964500"},{"name":"Yen-Juan Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Juan Chao","id":"37349359200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"499837","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite state vector quantization with multipath tree search strategy for image/video coding","abstract":"This paper presents a new vector quantization (VQ) algorithm exploiting the features of tree-search as well as finite state VQs for image/video coding. In the tree-search VQ, multiple candidates are identified for ongoing search to optimally determine an index of the minimum distortion. In addition, the desired codebook has been reorganized hierarchically to meet the concept of multipath search of neighboring trees so that picture quality can be improved by 4 dB on the average. In the finite state VQ, adaptation to the state codebooks is added to enhance the hit ratio of the index produced by the tree-search VQ. Thus, compressed bits can be further reduced. An identifier code is then included to indicate to which output indexes belong. Therefore, this modified algorithm not only reaches a higher compression ratio, but also achieves better quality compared to conventional finite-state and tree-search VQs. Finally, suitable VLSI architectures for real-time performance are proposed here (1) to remove the bottleneck of iteration bound in finite-state VQ and (2) to provide parallel computing structure for tree-search VQ to meet computational requirements.","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/10886/00499837.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.499837","doi":"10.1109/76.499837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499837","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Video coding","Image coding","Computational complexity","Automata","Chaos","Very large scale integration","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector quantisation","video coding","image coding","VLSI","tree searching","iterative methods","parallel algorithms","pipeline processing","digital signal processing chips","CMOS digital integrated circuits","finite state machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite state vector quantization","multipath tree search strategy","video coding","image coding","minimum distortion","codebook","multipath search","neighboring trees","picture quality","finite state VQ","identifier code","compression ratio","VLSI architectures","real-time performance","iteration","parallel computing structure","computational requirements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Finite state vector quantization with multipath tree search strategy for image/video coding","accessionNumber":"5301480","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite state vector quantization with multipath tree search strategy for image/video coding","sourcePdf":"00499837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045273S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"5","articleId":"499837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":499838,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Depending on the membership of the picture to each subcategory, color saturation changes are computed and used to modify the color saturation of the following field. The categorization is done by using neural network classifiers operating on the color difference signals. We describe the principles of the color correction scheme, its implementation using analog hardware and its interface to a television. Performance of the color adjustment technique implemented using real-time hardware in a television is discussed. Oversaturated and under-saturated pictures in both facial and nonfacial tone categories can be detected and corrected. The technique lends itself to low-cost analog implementations.","doi":"10.1109/76.499838","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/10886/00499838.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"307","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499838.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.499838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video color enhancement using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/499838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Video color enhancement using neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5301481","publicationDate":"June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video color enhancement using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00499838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02787S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"2","articleId":"499838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":499840,"authors":[{"name":"Lai-Man Po","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Lai-Man Po","id":"37270836200"},{"name":"Wing-Chung Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wing-Chung Ma","id":"37346434000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"499840","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1063,"citationCountPatent":81,"totalDownloads":2311},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Transform coding","Motion compensation","Redundancy","Image sequences","Computational modeling","Video compression","Discrete cosine transforms","MPEG standards","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","image sequences","motion compensation","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-step search algorithm","fast block motion estimation","image sequences","center-biased motion vector distribution","center-biased checking point pattern","halfway-stop technique","simulation","performance","three-step search","motion compensation errors","worst-case computational requirement","average computational requirement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/76.499840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/10886/00499840.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"317","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00499840.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.499840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=499840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel four-step search algorithm for fast block motion estimation","abstract":"Based on the real world image sequence's characteristic of center-biased motion vector distribution, a new four-step search (4SS) algorithm with center-biased checking point pattern for fast block motion estimation is proposed in this paper.
