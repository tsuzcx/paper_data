We introduce the App Sampling Problem, and study its effects on sets of user review data. We investigate the effects of sampling bias, and techniques for its amelioration in App Store Mining and Analysis, where sampling bias is often unavoidable. We mine 106,891 requests from 2,729,103 user reviews and investigate the properties of apps and reviews from 3 different partitions: the sets with fully complete review data, partially complete review data, and no review data at all. We find that app metrics such as price, rating, and download rank are significantly different between the three completeness levels. We show that correlation analysis can find trends in the data that prevail across the partitions, offering one possible approach to App Store Analysis in the presence of sampling bias.","doi":"10.1109/MSR.2015.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2015.19","startPage":"123","endPage":"133","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180033/7180053/07180073.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The App Sampling Problem for App Store Mining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"The App Sampling Problem for App Store Mining","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180073/","accessionNumber":"15397946","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180073/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The App Sampling Problem for App Store Mining","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"5594a123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09135S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180033","isNumber":"7180053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180033","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7180053","articleId":"7180073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":7180079,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Bird","affiliation":["Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bird","id":"37299418300"},{"name":"Trevor Carnahan","affiliation":["Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Carnahan","id":"37085565843"},{"name":"Michaela Greiler","affiliation":["Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Greiler","id":"37600949700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5594-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1860"}],"articleNumber":"7180079","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180079","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Interviews","Databases","Software","Servers","Computational modeling","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","program diagnostics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code review analytics platform","tool-based code review","Microsoft","data mining","CodeFlow analytics","design decisions","enterprise setting","analytics platform"]}],"abstract":"Tool-based code review is growing in popularity and has become a standard part of the development process at Mi-crosoft.

The ability of these models to generalize well has ushered in tremendous advances in many fields such as natural language processing (NLP). Recent research in the software engineering (SE) community has demonstrated the usefulness of applying NLP techniques to software corpora. Hence, we motivate deep learning for software language modeling, highlighting fundamental differences between state-of-the-practice software language models and connectionist models. Our deep learning models are applicable to source code files (since they only require lexically analyzed source code written in any programming language) and other types of artifacts. We show how a particular deep learning model can remember its state to effectively model sequential data, e.g., Streaming software tokens, and the state is shown to be much more expressive than discrete tokens in a prefix. Then we instantiate deep learning models and show that deep learning induces high-quality models compared to n-grams and cache-based n-grams on a corpus of Java projects. We experiment with two of the models' hyper parameters, which govern their capacity and the amount of context they use to inform predictions, before building several committees of software language models to aid generalization. Then we apply the deep learning models to code suggestion and demonstrate their effectiveness at a real SE task compared to state-of-the-practice models. Finally, we propose avenues for future work, where deep learning can be brought to bear to support model-based testing, improve software lexicons, and conceptualize software artifacts. Thus, our work serves as the first step toward deep learning software repositories.","doi":"10.1109/MSR.2015.38","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180033/7180053/07180092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2015.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180053","startPage":"334","endPage":"345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Deep Learning Software Repositories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward Deep Learning Software Repositories","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180092/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15397960","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180092/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Deep Learning Software Repositories","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"5594a334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104451S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180033","isNumber":"7180053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180033","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7180053","articleId":"7180092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7180121,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Ponzanelli","affiliation":["REVEAL @ Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Ponzanelli","id":"38252061700"},{"name":"Andrea Mocci","affiliation":["REVEAL @ Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Mocci","id":"37315795200"},{"name":"Michele Lanza","affiliation":["REVEAL @ Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Lanza","id":"37085423320"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5594-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1860"}],"articleNumber":"7180121","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Java","Natural languages","XML","Grammar","Software","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Java","question answering (information retrieval)","software engineering","Web sites","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["StORMeD","stack overflow ready made data","question and answer Website","software engineering researchers","natural language","source code","stack traces","configuration files","XML","JSON format","heterogeneous abstract syntax tree","term frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["island parsing","h-ast","unstructured data"]}],"abstract":"Stack Overflow is the de facto Question and Answer (Q&A) website for developers, and it has been used in many approaches by software engineering researchers to mine useful data.

We constructed a full island grammar capable of modeling the set of 700,000 Stack Overflow discussions talking about Java, building a heterogeneous abstract syntax tree (H-AST) of each post (question, answer or comment) in a discussion. The resulting dataset models every Stack Overflow discussion, providing a full H-AST for each type of structured fragment (i.e., JSON, XML, Java, Stack traces), and complementing this information with a set of basic meta-information like term frequency to enable natural language analyses.

However, the coherent integration performance can be greatly influenced by the range migration (RM), and Doppler frequency migration (DFM) effects for the highly maneuvering targets. In this paper, a fast non-searching method based on adjacent correlation function (ACF) and Lv's transform (LT), is proposed to realize the coherent integration for a maneuvering target. In particular, it first employs the ACF to correct the RM and reduce the order of DFM. Then, the coherent integration is obtained via LT. The advantage of the presented method is that it can achieve the coherent integration without any searching procedure, and thus the computational cost is reduced significantly. Finally, the simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180269/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15431026","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Detection Method for Maneuvering Target in Coherent Radar","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201276, 61178068 and 61301266"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2012Z001, ZYGX2013J012, ZYGX2014J013 and ZYGX2014Z005"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M550465"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"A1098524023901001063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Detection Method for Maneuvering Target in Coherent Radar","sourcePdf":"jsen-cui-2464788-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087727S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7225207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7225207","articleId":"7180269","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7180274,"authors":[{"name":"Julie Steinke","affiliation":["George Mason University"],"bio":{"p":["Julie Steinke is a postdoctoral research fellow in George Mason University's Industrial/Organizational Psychology program.

The photoplethysmographic signals were extracted and used to calculate heart rate, saturation of oxygen, and pulse transits time. The pulse transit time was utilized in the estimation of continuous blood pressure measurement. The pulse oximetry implementation applies reflectance-based sensing on the user's fingertip and palm. Skin temperature is also measurable through the use of a digital temperature sensor. The system is capable of providing feedback to the user by means of a smartphone application receiving data from the device through Bluetooth.

Previous research has outlined the importance of gait analysis to assess frailty and fall risk in elderly patients. Several solutions, based on wearable sensors, have been proposed to assist geriatricians in mobility assessment tests, such as the Timed Up-and-Go test. However, these methods can only be applied to supervised scenarios and do not allow continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of gait. The method we propose is designed to achieve continuous monitoring of gait in a completely unsupervised fashion, requiring the use of a single waist-mounted accelerometer. The user's gait patterns are automatically learned using specific acceleration-based features, while anomaly detection is used to capture subtle changes in the way the user walks. All the required processing can be executed in real time on the wearable device. The method was evaluated with 30 volunteers, who simulated a knee flexion impairment. On average, our method obtained ~84% accuracy in the recognition of abnormal gait segments lasting ~5 s. Prompt detection of gait anomalies could enable early intervention and prevent falls.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2464774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7225207/07180304.pdf","startPage":"6640","endPage":"6649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2464774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An On-Node Processing Approach for Anomaly Detection in Gait","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180304/","displayDocTitle":"An On-Node Processing Approach for Anomaly Detection in Gait","volume":"15","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15431028","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180304/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An On-Node Processing Approach for Anomaly Detection in Gait","sourcePdf":"jsen-cola-2464774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106459S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7225207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7225207","articleId":"7180304","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180311,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It models the time-varying channel coefficients as local polynomials so as to obtain the expressions of the bias and variance terms in the mean square error (MSE) of the RLS algorithm. A new locally optimal VFF (LOVFF) is then derived by minimizing the resulting MSE and the theoretical analysis is found to be in good agreement with experimental results. Methods for estimating the parameters involved in this LOVFF are also developed, resulting in an improved RLS algorithm with VFF. The algorithm is further extended to include variable regularization and a QR decomposition (QRD) version which is numerically more stable and amenable to multiplier-less implementation using coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm. Applications of these algorithms to frequency estimation and adaptive beamforming in time-varying speech and audio signals are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Simulations show that the convergence and tracking performance of the proposed algorithms compare favorably with conventional algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2015.2464692","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7140863/07180311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2015.2464692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140863","startPage":"2059","endPage":"2069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Local Polynomial Modeling-Based Variable Forgetting Factor RLS Algorithm and Its Acoustic Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Local Polynomial Modeling-Based Variable Forgetting Factor RLS Algorithm and Its Acoustic Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15410259","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180311/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Local Polynomial Modeling-Based Variable Forgetting Factor RLS Algorithm and Its Acoustic Applications","sourcePdf":"taslp-chan-2464692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070536S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7140863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7140863","articleId":"7180311","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180320,"authors":[{"name":"Refik Caglar Kizilirmak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7180320/kizil-2464815_print-small.gif","p":["\nRefik Caglar Kizilirmak (M'12) was born in Izmir, Turkey, in 1981.

Specifically, we consider two light sources in an office space: one is the information source employed on the ceiling and the other one is a task light. Our system uses dc biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) where the task light performs relaying to assist the communication and operates in half-duplex mode for both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying. We investigate the bit error rate (BER) performance of the relay-assisted VLC system and optimize the performance through optimal ac/dc power allocation under illumination constraints. The dc power allocation is determined by sharing the number of LED chips between the terminals to satisfy a desired luminance ratio. The ac power allocation decides the fraction of the information signal power to be consumed at the terminals in order to minimize the BER. Numerical results reveal that cooperation brings significant performance gains over direct transmission. We further provide comparisons of two relaying techniques under consideration and discuss the effect of clipping noise on the error rate performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-Assisted OFDM-Based Visible Light Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2464815","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07180320.pdf","startPage":"3765","endPage":"3778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2464815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Relay-Assisted OFDM-Based Visible Light Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7180320/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524655","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"5-980-2-411"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-Assisted OFDM-Based Visible Light Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-kizilirmak-2464815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163968S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7180320","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180321,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghui Wen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guanghui","lastName":"Wen","id":"37970245000"},{"name":"Yu Zhao","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38488790000"},{"name":"Zhisheng Duan","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Duan","id":"37305271000"},{"name":"Wenwu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenwu","lastName":"Yu","id":"37538109400"},{"name":"Guanrong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"firstName":"Guanrong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085348099"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7180321","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":245,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3283},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180321","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-agent systems","Observers","Topology","Vehicle dynamics","Protocols","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","linear systems","mobile robots","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher-order multi-leader multi-agent systems","dynamic output approach","distributed containment control problem","linear multi-leader multi-agent system","directed communication topology","convex hull","multi-vehicle system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked system","multi-leader system","containment control","observer-type protocol","multi-vehicle system","communication"]},{"kwd":["Communication","containment control","multi-leader system","multi-vehicle system","networked system","observer-type protocol"]}],"abstract":"This technical note addresses the distributed containment control problem for a linear multi-leader multi-agent system with a directed communication topology. A new class of distributed observer-type containment protocols based only on the relative output measurements of the neighboring agents is proposed, removing the impractical assumption in some of the existing approaches that the observers embedded in the multiple dynamic agents have to share information with their neighbors. Under the mild assumption that, for each follower, there exists at least one leader having a directed path to that follower, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the states of the followers to asymptotically converge to a convex hull formed by those of the dynamic leaders. Finally, some numerical simulations on containment of a multi-vehicle system are given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2015.2465071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7442193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2015.2465071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/7442193/07180321.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Containment of Higher-Order Multi-Leader Multi-Agent Systems: A Dynamic Output Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Containment of Higher-Order Multi-Leader Multi-Agent Systems: A Dynamic Output Approach","volume":"61","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180321/","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15874684","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180321/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304168, 61225013 and 61322302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20130595"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20110092120024"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"2014-DZXX-004"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong GRF","grantNumber":"CityU11201414"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Containment of Higher-Order Multi-Leader Multi-Agent Systems: A Dynamic Output Approach","sourcePdf":"tac-wen-2465071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121241S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7442193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"245","xplore-issue":"7442193","articleId":"7180321","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7180323,"authors":[{"name":"Han Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, E405 CSE Building, Gainesville, FL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/7235007/7180323/zhao-2464799-small.gif","p":["Han Zhao (S'07-M'14) received the BE degree in software\n engineering from Jilin University, China and the MSc degree in computer science from Oklahoma State University.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to minimize cloud resource rental cost associated with hosting such cloud-based application services, while meeting the projected service demand. This problem arises when applications generate high volume of data that incurs significant cost on storage and transfer. As a result, an application service provider (ASP) needs to carefully evaluate various resource rental options before finalizing the application deployment. We choose Amazon EC2 marketplace as a case of study, and analyze the economical trade-off for on-demand resource rental strategies. Given fixed resource pricing, we first develop a deterministic model, using a mixed integer linear program, to facilitate resource rental decision making. Evaluation results show that our planning optimization model reduces resource rental cost by as much as 50 percent compared with a baseline strategy. Next, we further investigate planning solutions to resource market featuring time-varying pricing (Amazon Spot Instance Market). We perform time-series analysis over the spot price trace and examine its predictability using auto-regressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA). We also develop a stochastic planning model based on multistage recourse. By comparing these two approaches, we discover that spot price forecasting does not provide our planning model with a crystal ball due to the weak correlation of past and future price, and the stochastic planning model better hedges against resource pricing uncertainty than resource rental planning using forecast prices.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2464799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/7235007/07180323.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7235007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2464799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Fine-Grained Resource Rental Planning in Cloud Computing","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6245519/7235007/7180323-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Fine-Grained Resource Rental Planning in Cloud Computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180323/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15415847","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ACI 1245880, ACI 1229576, CCF-1128805, OCI-0904938 and CNS-0709329"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1423165 and CNS-1343356"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1350230 and CNS-1343361"},{"fundingName":"Department of Homeland Security","grantNumber":"SLA-2014-ST-062-000057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Exploring Fine-Grained Resource Rental Planning in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tcc-zhao-2464799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107561S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"7235007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7235007","articleId":"7180323","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180327,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojie Su","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physical Society (Chongqing University), Ministry of Education and College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojie","lastName":"Su","id":"37530892100"},{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37287152000"},{"name":"Ligang Wu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ligang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37348622000"},{"name":"Yong-Duan Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physical Society (Chongqing University), Ministry of Education and College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Duan","lastName":"Song","id":"37293365200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7180327","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":356,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2958},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"In this note, the fault detection filtering problem is solved for nonlinear switched stochastic system in the T-S fuzzy framework.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the temperature dependence of the forward gate breakdown has been characterized. We report for the first time on the observation of a positive temperature dependence, i.e., a higher temperature leads to a higher gate breakdown voltage. Such unexpected behavior is explained by avalanche breakdown mechanism: at a high positive gate bias, electron/hole pairs are generated in the depletion region at the Schottky metal/p-GaN junction. Furthermore, at a high gate bias but before the catastrophic gate breakdown, a light emission was detected by a emission microscopy measurement. This effect indicates an avalanche luminescence, which is mainly due to the recombination of the generated electron/hole pairs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device

images, and the presence of shadows affects high spatial resolution remote sensing and multiangle remote sensing data. Shadows can lead to either a reduction in or a total loss of information in an image. This can potentially lead to the corruption of biophysical parameters derived from pixel values, such as vegetation indexes (VIs). VIs are widely used in remote sensing inversion applications. If the effects of shadows are not properly accounted for, retrieval may be uncertain when using a VI to calculate vegetation parameters. One of the major reasons that the effects of shadows are easy to be ignored in remote sensing is the spatial resolution of the measurement. High spatial and spectral resolutions are typically difficult to achieve simultaneously, and images that have one tend to not have the other. A ground-based imaging spectrometer brings a turning point to solve this problem as it can obtain both high spatial and high spectral resolutions to obtain feature and shadow images simultaneously. The resolution of the system used here was 1 mm at a height of 1 m, and the spectral resolution was better than 5 nm. For each pixel, the spectral curve of the image was almost a pure-pixel spectral curve, which allowed the differentiation of sunlit and shaded areas. To investigate the effects of shadows on different indexes, 14 hyperspectral VIs were calculated. Moreover, the vegetation fractional coverage calculated using the same 14 VIs was compared. The results show that shadows affect not only each narrowband of a VI but also vegetation parameters.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2015.2450218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7305891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2015.2450218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7305891/07180331.pdf","startPage":"2188","endPage":"2192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analysis of Shadow Effects on Spectral Vegetation Indexes Using a Ground-Based Imaging Spectrometer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of Shadow Effects on Spectral Vegetation Indexes Using a Ground-Based Imaging Spectrometer","volume":"12","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180331/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15566998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180331/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41371359 and 41371362"},{"fundingName":"National Ministry of Environmental Protection through the Special Research Funding for Public Benefit Industries","grantNumber":"2011467071"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004613","fundingName":"China Geological Survey","grantNumber":"1212011120222"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Analysis of Shadow Effects on Spectral Vegetation Indexes Using a Ground-Based Imaging Spectrometer","sourcePdf":"lgrs-wu-2450218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096641S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7305891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7305891","articleId":"7180331","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7180336,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Melzer","affiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Institute of Signal Processing, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7327073/7180336/7180336-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexander Melzer was born in Voitsberg, Austria, in 1988.

Besides leakage within the radar device itself, signal reflections from a fixed object in front of the antennas additionally introduce so-called short-range (SR) leakage. It causes a strong degradation of detection sensitivity due to the unpreventable phase noise of the transmit oscillator. In this work, we introduce an artificial on-chip target (OCT) to mitigate the SR leakage. The OCT consists of a delay line whose time delay is significantly smaller than the round-trip delay time of the SR leakage. This is motivated by the fact that in integrated circuits for automotive radar applications operating at 77 GHz delay lines in the range of only a few picoseconds can be realized with a reasonable amount of circuitry. Despite this constraint, we show that the proposed method achieves almost perfect cancelation of the SR leakage. The concept is based on the cross-correlation properties of the residual phase noise in the intermediate frequency (IF) domain. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in an FMCW radar system simulation. It almost perfectly shows that a gain in sensitivity of approximately 6 dB is achieved, compensating for the performance degradation caused by the SR leakage. The novel leakage cancelation concept is carried out mainly in the digital domain enabling high flexibility and adaptivity.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07180336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Range Leakage Cancelation in FMCW Radar Transceivers Using an Artificial On-Chip Target","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Short-Range Leakage Cancelation in FMCW Radar Transceivers Using an Artificial On-Chip Target","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180336/","volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7180336/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676868","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian Center of Competence in Mechatronics ACCM"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Short-Range Leakage Cancelation in FMCW Radar Transceivers Using an Artificial On-Chip Target","sourcePdf":"jstsp-melzer-2465298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081399S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7180336","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7180337,"authors":[{"name":"Assad Akhlaq","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, The University of South Australia, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Assad","lastName":"Akhlaq","id":"38071673100"},{"name":"R.

This method is only capable of unambiguously measuring range within an interval of length equal to the wavelength of the signal. To address this problem signals of multiple different wavelengths can be transmitted. The range can then be measured within an interval of length equal to the least common multiple of these wavelengths. Estimation of the range requires solution of a problem from computational number theory called the closest lattice point problem. Algorithms to solve this problem require a basis for this lattice. Constructing a basis is non-trivial and an explicit construction has only been given in the case that the wavelengths can be scaled to pairwise relatively prime integers. In this paper we present an explicit construction of a basis without this assumption on the wavelengths. This is important because the accuracy of the range estimator depends upon the wavelengths.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hyperspectral unmixing based on loopy belief propagation (BP) that enables the exploitation of spectral coherence in the end-members and spatial coherence in the abundances. In particular, we partition the factor graph into spectral coherence, spatial coherence, and bilinear subgraphs, and pass messages between them using a \u201cturbo\u201d approach. To perform message passing within the bilinear subgraph, we employ the bilinear generalized approximate message passing algorithm (BiG-AMP), a recently proposed belief-propagation-based approach to matrix factorization. Furthermore, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) strategy to tune the prior parameters and a model-order selection strategy to select the number of materials N.

Most spoof detectors are learning-based and rely on a set of training images. Consequently, the performance of any such spoof detector significantly degrades when encountering spoofs fabricated using novel materials not found in the training set. In real-world applications, the problem of fingerprint spoof detection must be treated as an open set recognition problem where incomplete knowledge of the fabrication materials used to generate spoofs is present at training time, and novel materials may be encountered during system deployment. To mitigate the security risk posed by novel spoofs, this paper introduces: 1) the use of the Weibull-calibrated SVM (W-SVM), which is relatively robust for open set recognition, as a novel-material detector and a spoof detector and 2) a scheme for the automatic adaptation of the W-SVM-based spoof detector to new spoof materials that leverages interoperability across classifiers. Experiments conducted on new partitions of the LivDet 2011 database designed for open set evaluation suggest: 1) a 97% increase in the error rate of the existing spoof detectors when tested using new spoof materials and 2) up to 44% improvement in spoof detection performance across spoof materials when the proposed adaptive approach is used.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2464772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7235010","startPage":"2447","endPage":"2460","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7235010/07180344.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open Set Fingerprint Spoof Detection Across Novel Fabrication Materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180344/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Open Set Fingerprint Spoof Detection Across Novel Fabrication Materials","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15451725","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open Set Fingerprint Spoof Detection Across Novel Fabrication Materials","sourcePdf":"tifs-ross-2464772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189824S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7235010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7235010","articleId":"7180344","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":7180345,"authors":[{"name":"Simon R.

These codes were first studied by Levenshtein in 1964, motivated by applications in synchronization. More recently these codes were independently invented (under the name cross-bifix-free codes) by Bajic and Stojanovic. We provide a simple construction for a class of non-overlapping codes which has optimal cardinality whenever n divides q. Moreover, for all parameters n and q, we show that a code from this class is close to optimal, in the sense that it has cardinality within a constant factor of an upper bound due to Levenshtein from 1970. Previous constructions have cardinality within a constant factor of the upper bound only when q is fixed. Chee, Kiah, Purkayastha, and Wang showed that a q-ary length n non-overlapping code contains at most q\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n/(2n-1) codewords; this bound is weaker than the Levenshtein bound. Their proof appealed to the application in synchronization: we provide a direct combinatorial argument to establish the bound of Chee et al. We also consider codes of short length, finding the leading term of the maximal cardinality of a non-overlapping code when n is fixed and q \u2192 \u221e. The largest cardinality of non-overlapping codes of lengths 3 or less is determined exactly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365024","htmlLink":"/document/7180345/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Non-Overlapping Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Overlapping Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-blackburn-2456634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08449S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7203188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7203188","articleId":"7180345","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180346,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Data Storage Systems Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38241850600"},{"name":"Jun Yao","affiliation":["Data Storage Systems Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yao","id":"37085675466"},{"name":"B.

For the write process, a 2-D data-dependent write channel combined with a micromagnetic model of the writer is investigated for BPMR. In order to better understand the proposed channel model, several 2-D patterns are investigated, and the corresponding write failure events are studied. It is observed that the write error rates (WERs) are different for different 2-D patterns due to the 2-D data-dependent nature of the write-in errors, even though the write failure rates are the same for these different 2-D patterns. For the readback process, a read channel, including media noise, is combined with the write channel, and the bit error rates (BERs) are studied for various 2-D patterns as a function of media jitter and write clock phase drift. It is observed that the 2-D pattern corresponding to four identical bits in a square pattern provides the best performance at a target BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n, because it can provide adequate tolerance to media noise and interference in down-track and cross-track (CT) directions. The difference between the WER and the BER after readback is studied for various 2-D patterns, and the pattern corresponding to 4 bits with transitions in the CT direction is found to exhibit the largest difference among the studied patterns due to the fact that inter-track interference is more severe than the inter-symbol interference. These results motivate possible inclusion of 2-D modulation codes in BPMR channel to avoid certain bit patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2464786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7330079/07180346.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2464786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D Write/Read Channel Model for Bit-Patterned Media Recording With Large Media Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180346/","displayDocTitle":"2-D Write/Read Channel Model for Bit-Patterned Media Recording With Large Media Noise","volume":"51","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601979","externalId":"3002611","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180346/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D Write/Read Channel Model for Bit-Patterned Media Recording With Large Media Noise","sourcePdf":"tmag-wang-2464786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099712S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7330079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7330079","articleId":"7180346","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180347,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7131605/7180347/yang-2465145-small.gif","p":["Huan Yang received the B.S. degree in computer science from the Heilongjiang Institute of Technology, China, in 2007, the M.S. degree in computer science from Shandong University, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

In this paper, we present a study on perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs subjectively and objectively. We construct a large-scale screen image quality assessment database (SIQAD) consisting of 20 source and 980 distorted SCIs. In order to get the subjective quality scores and investigate, which part (text or picture) contributes more to the overall visual quality, the single stimulus methodology with 11 point numerical scale is employed to obtain three kinds of subjective scores corresponding to the entire, textual, and pictorial regions, respectively. According to the analysis of subjective data, we propose a weighting strategy to account for the correlation among these three kinds of subjective scores. Furthermore, we design an objective metric to measure the visual quality of distorted SCIs by considering the visual difference of textual and pictorial regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SCI perceptual quality assessment scheme, consisting of the objective metric and the weighting strategy, can achieve better performance than 11 state-of-the-art IQA methods. To the best of our knowledge, the SIQAD is the first large-scale database published for quality evaluation of SCIs, and this research is the first attempt to explore the perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2465145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7131605/07180347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2465145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131605","startPage":"4408","endPage":"4421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual Quality Assessment of Screen Content Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual Quality Assessment of Screen Content Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180347/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15377752","pubMedId":"26259078","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180347/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingName":"Social Responsibility Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, StateEducation Ministry, China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual Quality Assessment of Screen Content Images","sourcePdf":"tip-yang-2465145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118951S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7131605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7131605","articleId":"7180347","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180353,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangyang Wang","affiliation":["Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7131605/7180353/wang-2462113-small.gif","p":["Zhangyang Wang (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, in 2012.

Modifications, such as seam carving or seam insertion, have been introduced to achieve aforesaid image retargeting. The changes in an image are not easily recognizable by human eyes. Inspired by the blocking artifact characteristics matrix (BACM), a method to detect tampers caused by seam modification on JPEG retargeted images without knowledge of the original image is proposed in this paper. In a BACM block matrix, we found that the original JPEG image demonstrates a regular symmetrical data, whereas the symmetrical data in a block reconstructed by seam modification is destroyed. Twenty-two features are proposed to train the data using a support vector machine classification method. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method provides a very high recognition rate for those JPEG retargeted images.

The proposed SSASR method aims at improving noise-free estimation for noisy HSI by making full use of highly correlated spectral information and highly similar spatial information via sparse representation, which consists of the following three steps. First, according to spectral correlation across bands, the HSI is partitioned into several nonoverlapping band subsets. Each band subset contains multiple continuous bands with highly similar spectral characteristics. Then, within each band subset, shape-adaptive local regions consisting of spatially similar pixels are searched in spatial domain. This way, spectral-spatial similar pixels can be grouped. Finally, the highly correlated and similar spectral-spatial information in each group is effectively used via the joint sparse coding, in order to generate better noise-free estimation. The proposed SSASR method is evaluated by different objective metrics in both real and simulated experiments. The numerical and visual comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2457614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7312390/07180362.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2457614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Adaptive Sparse Representation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180362/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Adaptive Sparse Representation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15568367","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180362/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61325007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172161"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Adaptive Sparse Representation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2457614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131524S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7312390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7312390","articleId":"7180362","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180364,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Asgar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Asgar","id":"37661417600"},{"name":"Ebrahim Afjei","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Afjei","id":"37297871400"},{"name":"Hossein Torkaman","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Torkaman","orcid":"0000-0002-4024-8719","id":"37398779300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7180364","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":900},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"The double-stator switched reluctance motor (DSSRM) has a potential to produce more power per volume than other types of SRMs. This paper offers a new design strategy concentrating on power rating to calculate the dimensions of a DSSRM. The new strategy is based on dissecting the DSSRM into two inner and outer rotor SRMs. In this regard, both inner and outer rotor SRMs are designed separately, and then, the results are merged together. The characteristics of the DSSRM are achieved utilizing analytical design and 3-D finite-element analysis (FEA). In addition, the obtained results are compared with dual SRM. To determine the appropriate performance of the motor, the magnetic analysis is performed utilizing a 3-D model. In addition, to achieve optimal operation, two different winding configurations are investigated and compared with each other. Finally, a prototype of the flat-type cup-shape DSSRM with a segmented rotor is fabricated and tested in the laboratory. The results of the analytical calculations and the FEA are validated by a testing motor, which show the accuracy and the design strategy, and it can be extensible to other types of motors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7330079/07180364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2465307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2465307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Strategy for Design and Analysis of a Double-Stator Switched Reluctance Motor: Electromagnetics, FEM, and Experiment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Reluctance motors","Decision support systems","Stator windings","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","reluctance motors","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-stator switched reluctance motor","DSSRM","electromagnetics","3D finite element analysis","FEA","power rating","inner rotor SRM","outer rotor SRM","magnetic analysis","winding configurations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetics analysis","motor design","analytical model","finite element analysis","double-stator switched","reluctance motor"]},{"kwd":["Analytical model","double-stator switched reluctance motor (DSSRM)","electromagnetics analysis","finite-element analysis (FEA)","motor design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A New Strategy for Design and Analysis of a Double-Stator Switched Reluctance Motor: Electromagnetics, FEM, and Experiment","volume":"51","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7180364/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601961","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","externalId":"8208808","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Strategy for Design and Analysis of a Double-Stator Switched Reluctance Motor: Electromagnetics, FEM, and Experiment","sourcePdf":"tmag-torkaman-2465307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101325S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7330079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7330079","articleId":"7180364","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180368,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Min Joe","affiliation":["Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7210242/7180368/joe-2454855-small.gif","p":["Sung-Min Joe received the M.S. degree from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2015.","He is currently with Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Hwasung, Korea."]},"firstName":"Sung-Min","lastName":"Joe","id":"37408193200"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7210242/7180368/lee-2454855-small.gif","p":["Jong-Ho Lee (SM\u201901) received the Ph.D. degree from Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, in 1993, in electronic engineering.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, from 1998 to 1999.

First, we recount two types of definitions for a long-term trend that appeared in previous studies and illustrate their intrinsic differences. We show that, by assuming an implicit temporal connection among the time series observed at different days/locations, the PCA trend brings several advantages to traffic time series analysis. We also describe and define the so-called short-term trend that cannot be characterized by existing definitions. Second, we sequentially review the role that trend modeling plays in four major problems in traffic time series analysis: abnormal data detection, data compression, missing data imputation, and traffic prediction. The relations between these problems are revealed, and the benefit of detrending is explained. For the first three problems, we summarize our findings in the last ten years and try to provide an integrated framework for future study. For traffic prediction problem, we present a new explanation on why prediction accuracy can be improved at data points representing the short-term trends if the traffic information from multiple sensors can be appropriately used. This finding indicates that the trend modeling is not only a technique to specify the temporal pattern but is also related to the spatial relation of traffic time series.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2457240","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7330243/07180371.pdf","startPage":"3430","endPage":"3439","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2457240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trend Modeling for Traffic Time Series Analysis: An Integrated Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Trend Modeling for Traffic Time Series Analysis: An Integrated Study","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15618564","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180371/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Support Program","grantNumber":"2013BAG18B00"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51278280"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Tsinghua University","grantNumber":"20131089307"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trend Modeling for Traffic Time Series Analysis: An Integrated Study","sourcePdf":"tits-li-2457240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109914S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7330243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7330243","articleId":"7180371","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7180376,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7180376/gao-2464806-small.gif","p":["\n\nHui Gao (S'10\u2013M'13) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in July 2007 and July 2012, respectively.

In particular, a novel reference signal space (RSS) is proposed to enable the distributed scheduling for both cluster-wise (CS) and group-wise (GS) patterns.

Different from prior analysis, time correlation in the channels is considered. Under time-correlated fading channels, the mutual information in multiple HARQ transmissions is correlated, making the analysis challenging. By using polynomial fitting technique, probability distribution function of the accumulated mutual information is derived. Three meaningful performance metrics including outage probability, average number of transmissions, and long term average throughput (LTAT) are then derived in closed-forms. Moreover, diversity order of HARQ-IR is also investigated. It is proved that full diversity can be achieved by HARQ-IR, i.e., the diversity order is equal to the number of transmissions, even under time-correlated fading channels. These analytical results are verified by simulations and enable the evaluation of the impact of various system parameters on the performance. Particularly, the results unveil the negative impact of time correlation on the outage and throughput performance. The results also show that although more transmissions would improve the outage performance, they may not be beneficial to the LTAT when time correlation is high. Optimal rate design to maximize the LTAT is finally discussed and significant LTAT improvement is demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of HARQ-IR Over Time-Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2464798","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07180377.pdf","startPage":"7096","endPage":"7109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2464798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of HARQ-IR Over Time-Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7180377/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676930","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Committee of University of Macau","grantNumber":"MYRG078(Y1-L2)-FST12-MSD and MYRG101(Y1-L3)-FST13-MSD."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of HARQ-IR Over Time-Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-ma-2464798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087921S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7180377","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180384,"authors":[{"name":"Qinliang Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7307924/7180384/7180384-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qinliang Su received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2014.

In this paper, an explicit error expression of the variance calculated by BP is derived. By novel representation of this error expression, a distributed message-passing algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of the variance calculated by BP. It is proved that the upper bound of the residual error in the improved variance monotonically decreases as the number of selected nodes in a particular set increases, and eventually vanishes to zero as the remaining graph becomes loop-free after removal of the selected nodes.

Under this constraint, SUs' data link usually suffers from either high error rate with limited transmission range or long end-to-end delay caused by multi-hop transmissions. To improve the performance of SUs, cooperative routing using mutual-information accumulation is introduced in CRNs for the first time in this paper. To be specific, the routing and resource allocation problem in underlay CRNs is investigated and is factored into two sub-problems, each of which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm is introduced and simulation results show that both the centralized and distributed algorithms can reduce upto 77% of the end-to-end delay compared to the traditional multi-hop delay-optimal routing in CRNs. Finally, theoretical analysis on the end-to-end delay for a one-dimensional (1-D) network in the low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) region is conducted. Both the analytical and simulation results show that mutual-information accumulation can significantly decrease the delay of underlay CRNs, especially in the scenario where PUs have a tight interference power constraint.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2464801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07180386.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2464801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","startPage":"7110","endPage":"7122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Routing for Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks Using Mutual-Information Accumulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Routing for Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks Using Mutual-Information Accumulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676954","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180386/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF"},{"fundingName":"ECCS-150951"},{"fundingName":"AFRL","grantNumber":"FA8750-14-C-0077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Routing for Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks Using Mutual-Information Accumulation","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2464801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141808S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7180386","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180387,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxiao Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/8482268/7180387/jiang-2464810-small.gif","p":["Chunxiao Jiang (S'09-M'13) received the BS degree from\n Beihang University in 2008 and the PhD degree from Tsinghua University (THU) in 2013, both with the highest honors.

In this paper, we consider the on-demand mechanism design in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS), including resource allocation and pricing issues under dynamic scenarios. Most of existing works on mechanism design assumed static and independent individual utility, while the cloud computing services are provided in a dynamic environment. To solve such problems, we start with analyzing the Google cluster-usage dataset to draw the statistical and stochastic characteristics of the IaaS consumers and providers. Based on the characteristics mined from real data, we propose a stochastic matching algorithm with Markov Decision Process (MDP), which aims at optimizing the long-term system efficiency, with its online version using Q-learning method to address the imperfect model estimation problem. We further design an efficient (EF), incentive compatible (IC), individual rational (IR) auction mechanism, which is an extension of traditional Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. The proposed mechanism is studied under two application scenario: quality sensitive services, where unilateral MDP-VCG auction is implemented; and quality insensitive services, where MDP-VCG double auction is implemented. To verify the performance of our proposed mechanism, we conduct experiment using the Google dataset and show that the proposed MDP-based VCG auction mechanism can achieve EF, IC and IR properties simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2015.2464810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2464810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/8482268/07180387.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8482268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Auction Mechanism Design in IaaS Cloud Computing","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18132945","htmlLink":"/document/7180387/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2018","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371079"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Auction Mechanism Design in IaaS Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tsc-jiang-2464810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101165S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"8482268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8482268","articleId":"7180387","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180389,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Ming Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering","MOE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7307924/7180389/7180389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui-Ming Wang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees, both in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.

We focus on a practical scenario that only the eavesdroppers' channel distribution information (CDI) is available and the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate receiver is acquired through training and analog feedback. By taking explicitly into account the signaling overhead and training power overhead incurred by channel estimation and feedback, we define the achievable effective ergodic secrecy rate (ESR), and investigate a joint power allocation and training overhead optimization problem for the maximization of effective ESR. We first derive a deterministic approximation for the achievable effective ESR which facilitates the joint optimization. Then, efficient iterative algorithms are proposed to solve the considered nonconvex optimization problem. In particular, in the high-SNR regime, a block coordinate descent method (BCDM) is proposed to handle the joint optimization. In the low-SNR regime, we transform the problem into a sequence of geometric programmings (GPs) and locate its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. For the general case of SNR, we maximize the lower bound of the achievable effective ESR.

The fault frequency of single-phase rectifier is higher than that of three-phase inverter. Thus, this paper presents a new and fast model-based approach for open-switch fault diagnosis of the single-phase pulse width modulation rectifier, based on the mixed logical dynamic model and residual generation. It requires no additional hardware but only some measurements and command signals which are available in control system. This diagnosis method is quite suitable for electrical traction application due to the fast diagnosis time, simple structure and high reliability. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that such diagnosis method can locate the faulty switch in a few milliseconds which is important to avoid catastrophic consequences.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Rectifiers","Switches","Pulse width modulation","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Inverters","Fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","PWM invertors","PWM rectifiers","railways","reliability","traction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open-switch fault diagnosis method","single-phase PWM rectifier","model-based approach","high-speed railway electrical traction drive system","DC-link circuit","three-phase inverter","single-phase pulse width modulation rectifier","mixed logical dynamic model","residual generation","catastrophic consequence avoidance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","mixed logical dynamic (MLD) model","open-switch fault","single-phase PWM rectifier"]},{"kwd":["Fault diagnosis","mixed logical dynamic (MLD) model","open-switch fault","single-phase PWM rectifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2465299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7352399/07180401.pdf","startPage":"3816","endPage":"3826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2465299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Open-Switch Fault Diagnosis Method for Single-Phase PWM Rectifier Using a Model-Based Approach in High-Speed Railway Electrical Traction Drive System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Open-Switch Fault Diagnosis Method for Single-Phase PWM Rectifier Using a Model-Based Approach in High-Speed Railway Electrical Traction Drive System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180401/","volume":"31","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180401/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15677481","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201407000026"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1134205 and 51277153"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Open-Switch Fault Diagnosis Method for Single-Phase PWM Rectifier Using a Model-Based Approach in High-Speed Railway Electrical Traction Drive System","sourcePdf":"tpel-gou-2465299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083944S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7180401","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7180402,"authors":[{"name":"James A.

However, significant technological steps have to occur before even the smallest autonomous task is ready to be presented to the regulatory authorities. In this paper, we address the initial steps of this process, in particular the development of control concepts satisfying the basic safety requirements of robotic surgery, i.e., providing the robot with the necessary dexterity and a stable and smooth behavior of the surgical tool. Two specific situations are considered: the automatic adaptation to changing tissue stiffness and the transition from autonomous to teleoperated mode. These situations replicate real-life cases when the surgeon adapts the stiffness of her/his arm to penetrate tissues of different consistency and when, due to an unexpected event, the surgeon has to take over the control of the surgical robot. To address the first case, we propose a passivity-based interactive control architecture that allows us to implement stable time-varying interactive behaviors. For the second case, we present a two-layered bilateral control architecture that ensures a stable behavior during the transition between autonomy and teleoperation and, after the switch, limits the effect of initial mismatch between master and slave poses. The proposed solutions are validated in the realistic surgical scenario developed within the EU-funded I-SUR project, using a surgical robot prototype specifically designed for the autonomous execution of surgical tasks like the insertion of needles into the human body.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surgery","Admittance","Impedance","Switches","Medical robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","medical robotics","mobile robots","surgery","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy tank-based interactive control architecture","autonomous robotic surgery","teleoperated robotic surgery","tissue stiffness","time-varying interactive behaviors","two-layered bilateral control architecture","EU-funded I-SUR project","surgical robot","medical robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy tanks","interactive control","medical robots and systems","telerobotics"]},{"kwd":["Energy tanks","interactive control","medical robots and systems","telerobotics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180405","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2015.2455791","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/7274528/07180405.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2015.2455791","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy Tank-Based Interactive Control Architecture for Autonomous and Teleoperated Robotic Surgery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Tank-Based Interactive Control Architecture for Autonomous and Teleoperated Robotic Surgery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180405/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","volume":"31","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7180405/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15484805","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013","grantNumber":"270396"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy Tank-Based Interactive Control Architecture for Autonomous and Teleoperated Robotic Surgery","sourcePdf":"tro-ferraguti-2455791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144918S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7274528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"7274528","articleId":"7180405","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7180406,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyang Xin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7358222/7180406/7180406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haiyang Xin received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

In this system, users are grouped into pairs and two users in each pair exchange information through a common relay. The transmission scheme consists of two phases. In the uplink phase, the relay's receive signal space is divided into two subspaces for each pair: in one subspace, the signals of the two users are near-parallel, and physical-layer network coding (PNC) decoding is applied to retrieve network-coded messages; in the other subspace, the two user signals are near-orthogonal, and complete decoding (CD) is applied to retrieve individual user messages. In the downlink phase, the relay's transmit signal space is split into orthogonal subspaces for each pair, and in each subspace a common message is broadcasted to the two users. Our main contribution is to establish a critical link between the transmission scheme and the concept of principal angle in linear algebra. In particular, principal angle quantizes the degree of orthogonality between the user signals and helps determining how to partition the relay's receive signal space into PNC decoding subspace and CD decoding subspace. Building on that, we discuss the optimal design of user/relay precoders for both uplink and downlink phases to maximize the asymptotic sum-rate of the proposed scheme at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The analysis and numerical results indicate that our scheme performs close to the cut-set outer bound and significantly outperforms the existing schemes in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2465358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7358222/07180406.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2465358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Pair MIMO Two-Way Relaying: A Principal-Angle Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180406/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Pair MIMO Two-Way Relaying: A Principal-Angle Perspective","volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15663181","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180406/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471241"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Pair MIMO Two-Way Relaying: A Principal-Angle Perspective","sourcePdf":"tsp-yuan-2465358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10022S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7358222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7358222","articleId":"7180406","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7180407,"authors":[{"name":"Dixian Zhao","affiliation":["Southeast University, National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, School of Information and Engineering, Nanjing, China","KU Leuven, ESAT-MICAS, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7180407/7180407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dixian Zhao (S\u201910\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Delft, The Netherlands, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Leuven, Belgium, in 2015.","From late 2005 to 2007, he was with Auto-ID Lab, Shanghai, China, where he developed the non-volatile memory for passive RFID tags.

Such performance can be obtained with time-based digital pixel sensors (DPS) working at ultra-low voltage (ULV), at the expense of lower dynamic range, higher fixed-pattern noise (FPN) and thus poorer image quality. To address this problem, three key techniques were developed in this work for DPS pixels: wide-range adaptive body biasing, low-gating of the 2-transistor in-pixel comparator and digital readout performing delta-reset sampling with low switching activity and robust timing closure. These concepts were demonstrated by designing and fabricating a 128 \u00d7 128 CMOS image sensor array in a 65 nm low-power CMOS logic process. Operating at 0.5 V, it features an FPN of 0.66%, a dynamic range of 42 dB and a fill factor of 57% with a 4 \u03bcm pixel pitch, while consuming only 17 pJ/(frame.pixel) and 8.8 \u03bcW at 32 fps.

In this paper, we propose an edge-based formulation for the combined-cycle units in the unit commitment problem to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of current modeling approaches. Our formulation can 1) clearly describe the transition processes among different configurations so as to satisfy the ISO financial offer submission requirements and (2) capture physical constraints of each turbine, including the exact min-up/down time and time dependent startup cost, in the combined-cycle units so as to increase the operational flexibility while ensuring system feasibility. This model fits well with the current U.S. deregulated electricity market. The final numerical studies show that our approaches perform better than the current configuration-based modeling approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2443036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2443036","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1819","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7453237/07180419.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7453237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Edge-Based Formulation for Combined-Cycle Units","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"An Edge-Based Formulation for Combined-Cycle Units","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2016","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180419/","accessionNumber":"15935178","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180419/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Edge-Based Formulation for Combined-Cycle Units","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-guan-2443036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133919S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7453237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7453237","articleId":"7180419","onlineDate":"05 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7180506,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Yang","affiliation":["Montana State University"],"bio":{"p":["Qing Yang, Ph.D., is a RightNow Technologies assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, Montana State University.

However, the energy resources are still insufficient while the harvesting module is added on the node. To prolong the network lifetime and meet the demand of a green wireless network, a dynamic gradient-aware hierarchical packet forwarding mechanism is designed. According to the relative positions of nodes, gradient-aware clusters are established. Consequently, considering the energy conversion efficiency and relative distance, cluster heads are selected reasonably. Furthermore, by exploiting the available energy and the number of cluster members, packets can be forwarded to the sink in an energy-efficient manner. Results show that the network lifetime can be noticeably improved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7180495/07180514.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical packet forwarding mechanism for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks","Energy harvesting","Relays","Sensors","Energy storage","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","gradient methods","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical packet forwarding mechanism","energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","perpetual energy supply","green wireless network","dynamic gradient-aware hierarchical packet forwarding mechanism","energy conversion efficiency","relative distance","network lifetime"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical packet forwarding mechanism for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","volume":"53","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7180514/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15360364","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical packet forwarding mechanism for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"019WANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065627S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7180495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7180495","articleId":"7180514","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180515,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["University of Southampton"],"bio":{"p":["Rong Zhang (rz@ecs.soton.ac.uk) received his Ph.D. in 2009 from the University of Southampton, United Kingdom.

Many data center services require lower delay and higher availability with end-to-end guaranteed QoS, which involves both application and transport network resources. However, in the current mode of operation, the control of elastic optical networks and data centers is separately deployed. Enabling even limited interworking among these separated control systems requires the adoption of complex and inelastic interfaces among the various networks, and this solution is not efficient enough to provide the required QoS. In this article, we present a novel cross stratum optimization (CSO) architecture in elastic data center optical interconnection. The proposed architecture can allow global optimization and control across elastic optical transport network and data center application stratum heterogeneous resources to meet the QoS requirement with the objective of optical as a service (OaaS). The functional modules of CSO architecture, including the core elements of application and transport controllers, are described in detail. The cooperation procedure in CSO-based service provisioning and cross stratum service resilience modes is investigated. The overall feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture is also experimentally demonstrated on our OaaS testbed with four OpenFlow-enabled elastic optical nodes, and compared to MFA, ALB, and CSO-DGLB service provisioning schemes in terms of path setup/release/adjustment latency, blocking probability, and resource occupation rate. Numerical results are given and analyzed based on the testbed. Some future discussion and exploration issues are presented in the conclusion.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7180495/07180520.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180495","startPage":"130","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSO: cross stratum optimization for optical as a service","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CSO: cross stratum optimization for optical as a service","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180520/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15360374","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180520/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSO: cross stratum optimization for optical as a service","sourcePdf":"025YANG3_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044151S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7180495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7180495","articleId":"7180520","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7180521,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajia Chen","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Jiajia Chen (jiajiac@kth.se) received a B.S. degree (2004) from Zhejiang University, China, and a Ph.D. degree (2009) from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

This is driving the demand for highly scalable, flexible, and energy-efficient networks inside data centers, in particular for the edge tier, which requires a large number of interconnects and consumes the dominant part of the overall power. Optical fiber communication is widely recognized as the highest energy- and cost-efficient technique to offer ultra-large capacity for telecommunication networks. It has also been considered as a promising transmission technology for future data center applications. Taking into account the characteristics of the traffic generated by the servers, such as locality, multicast, dynamicity, and burstiness, the emphasis of the research on data center networks has to be put on architectures that leverage optical transport to the greatest possible extent. However, no feasible solution based on optical switching is available so far for handling the data center traffic at the edge tier. Therefore, apart from conventional optical switching, we investigate a completely different paradigm, passive optical interconnects, and aim to explore the possibility for optical interconnects at the top of the rack. In this article, we present three major types of passive optical interconnects and carry out a performance assessment with respect to the ability to host data center traffic, scalability, optical power budget, complexity of the required interface, cost, and energy consumption. Our results have verified that the investigated passive optical interconnects can achieve a significant reduction of power consumption and maintain cost at a similar level compared to its electronic counterpart. Furthermore, several research directions on passive optical interconnects have been pointed out for future green data centers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7180495/07180521.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical interconnects at the top of the rack for energy-efficient data centers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Optical switches","Optical interconnections","Passive optical networks","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","optical fibre communication","optical interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient data centers","optical fiber communication","data center applications","optical transport","passive optical interconnects","power consumption","electronic counterpart"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optical interconnects at the top of the rack for energy-efficient data centers","volume":"53","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7180521/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15360358","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical interconnects at the top of the rack for energy-efficient data centers","sourcePdf":"026CHEN2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039719S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7180495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7180495","articleId":"7180521","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180523,"authors":[{"name":"Karoly Farkas","affiliation":["Inter-University Centre for Telecommunications and Informatics, Debrecen, Hungary","Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"bio":{"p":["K\u00c1roly Farkas (farkask@hit.bme.hu) received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in 2007 from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and his M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 1998 from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), Hungary.

For example, a live timetable service of public transportation can increase the efficiency of travel planning substantially. However, its implementation in a traditional way requires the deployment of some costly sensing and tracking infrastructure. Mobile crowdsensing is an alternative, when the crowd of passengers and their mobile devices are used to gather data for almost free of charge. In this paper, we put the emphasis on the introduction of our crowdsensing based public transport information service, what we have been developing as a prototype smart city application. The front-end interface of this service is called TrafficInfo. It is a simple and easy-to-use Android application which visualizes real-time public transport information of the given city on Google Maps. The lively updates of transport schedule information relies on the automatic stop event detection of public transport vehicles. TrafficInfo is built upon our Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based communication framework what we designed to facilitate the development of crowd assisted smart city applications. The paper introduces shortly this framework, than describes TrafficInfo in detail together with the developed stop event detector.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7180495/07180523.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowdsending based public transport information service in smart cities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180523/","displayDocTitle":"Crowdsending based public transport information service in smart cities","volume":"53","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15360373","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180523/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowdsending based public transport information service in smart cities","sourcePdf":"028FARKAS_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054666S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7180495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7180495","articleId":"7180523","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7180526,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Perez-Romero","affiliation":["Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"],"bio":{"p":["Jordi Perez-Romero (jorperez@tsc.upc.edu) is an associate professor in the Department of Signal Theory and Communications at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain, where he received his telecommunications engineering and Ph.D. degrees in 1997 and 2001, respectively.

To overcome the aggravating \u201cpower wall\u201d issue, some emerging memory technologies such as STT-MRAM (Spin transfer torque magnetic RAM), PCRAM (Phase change RAM), and ReRAM(Resistive RAM) are proposed as promising candidates for next generation cache design. Although there are several existing simulation tools available for cache design, such as NVSim and CACTI, they either cannot support the most advanced PMA (Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy) STT-MRAM model or lack the ability for multi-banked large capacity cache simulation. In this paper, we propose an architecture level design framework for cache design from device level up to array structure level, which can support the most advanced PMA STT-MRAM technology. The simulation results are analyzed and compared with those produced by NVSim, which prove the correctness of our framework. The potential benefits of PMA STT-MRAM used as multi-banked L2 and L3 cache are also investigated in the paper. We believe that our framework will be helpful for computer architecture researchers to adopt the PMA STT-MRAM in on-chip cache design.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180576","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture-level cache simulation framework supporting advanced PMA STT-MRAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An architecture-level cache simulation framework supporting advanced PMA STT-MRAM","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180576/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15347230","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180576/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture-level cache simulation framework supporting advanced PMA STT-MRAM","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP00205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066734S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180577,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Alsuwaiyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Alsuwaiyan","id":"37085471077"},{"name":"Kartik Mohanram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Kartik","lastName":"Mohanram","id":"37272330500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7849-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"7180577","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180577","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Nonvolatile memory","Phase change materials","Hamming distance","Random access memory","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","energy consumption","integrated circuit modelling","low-power electronics","optimisation","phase change memories","probability","statistical analysis","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-N-write architecture","multilevel cell nonvolatile memories","MFNW mode","NVM technologies","MLC NVM","cell write energies","cell endurance","flip-N-write encoding solution","cell Hamming distance","CHD mode","energy Hamming distance","EHD mode","probabilistic model","statistical behavior","memory word","energy consumption","word length optimization","energy reduction","memory overhead constraints","delay overheads","phase change memory","SPEC2006 benchmarks"]}],"abstract":"The increased capacity of multi-level cells (MLC) in emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies comes at the cost of higher cell write energies and lower cell endurance. In this paper, we describe MFNW, a Flip-N-Write encoding solution that effectively reduces the average write energy and improves endurance of MLC NVMs. Two MFNW modes are proposed and analyzed: cell Hamming distance (CHD) mode and energy Hamming distance (EHD) mode. For both modes, we derive a probabilistic model to approximate the statistical behavior of MFNW. For negligible error, the probabilistic model predicts the average number of cell writes per memory word, which is proportional to energy consumption. This enables word length optimization to maximize energy reduction subject to memory overhead constraints. We also estimate the hardware and delay overheads to integrate MFNW into a phase change memory prototype. MFNW is compared to two state-of-the-art techniques in the literature using traces of SPEC2006 benchmarks. Simulation results show an average energy reduction of 19% over the state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of MFNW to the choice of word length, and our findings suggest a tradeoff between word length and energy reduction.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180577","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180577.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MFNW: A Flip-N-Write architecture for multi-level cell non-volatile memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"MFNW: A Flip-N-Write architecture for multi-level cell non-volatile memories","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15347220","htmlLink":"/document/7180577/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MFNW: A Flip-N-Write architecture for multi-level cell non-volatile memories","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP00313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076326S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180582,"authors":[{"name":"Erya Deng","affiliation":["SPINTEC CEA/UJF/G-INP/CNRS, Grenoble, France","IEF, Univ.

MTJ is one of the most promising candidates for the next generation memory and logic chips thanks to its non-volatility, fast access speed, high endurance and easy 3-D integration with CMOS technology. In order to build a high-performance magnetic processor, this paper proposes a new design of magnetic full-adder (MFA) whose input signals are all stored in non-volatile states. Input data Q is stored in MTJs that are embedded in the MFA, while input data A and B are stored in two voltage sensing 2T/2MTJ cells. By using an industrial CMOS 28 nm design kit and a MTJ compact model, we validate this MFA and confirm its merits of high robustness, high speed and low power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180582","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180582.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust magnetic full-adder with voltage sensing 2T/2MTJ cell","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust magnetic full-adder with voltage sensing 2T/2MTJ cell","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180582/","accessionNumber":"15347227","publicationDate":"July 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust magnetic full-adder with voltage sensing 2T/2MTJ cell","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP00823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06621S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7180584,"authors":[{"name":"Naoya Onizawa","affiliation":["Research Institute of Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoya","lastName":"Onizawa","id":"37085381450"},{"name":"Akira Mochizuki","affiliation":["Research Institute of Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Mochizuki","id":"37072689300"},{"name":"Akira Tamakoshi","affiliation":["Research Institute of Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Tamakoshi","id":"37085384989"},{"name":"Takahiro Hanyu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Hanyu","id":"37085392870"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7849-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"7180584","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180584","abstract":"In energy harvesting applications, a power supply generated from a renewable power source is unstable that may induce a sudden power outage, losing data being processed. This paper introduces a sudden power-outage resilient nonvolatile microprocessor based on a flashback architecture for immediate system recovery, where nonvolatile storage elements, called magnetic-tunnel-junction (MTJ), are exploited with standard CMOS gates. In the proposed architecture, data stored within a past few clocks are also kept in redundant MTJ-based nonvolatile flip-flops (NV-FF), while storing the current data in NV-FFs. Even if a sudden outage induces a failure of storing the data partly, the inconsistency of the stored data is automatically and immediately recovered by reordering the past data, which enables a continuous operation. A nonvolatile Cortex-M0 processor based on the proposed architecture is implemented using 90nm CMOS/100nm MTJ technologies. It demonstrates the immediate system recovery after a sudden power outage with a 32% area reduction compared to a triple modular redundancy based equivalent microprocessor.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180584","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures

This makes them incapable to solve data-intensive applications within economically acceptable limits. Computation-In-Memory (CIM) architecture, based on the integration of storage and computation in the same physical location using non-volatile memristor technology offers a potential solution for the memory bottleneck. This paper presents a CIM based parallel adder, and shows its potentials and superiority for intensive computing and massive parallelism by comparing it with state-of-the art computing systems including multicore, GPU and FPGA architecture. The results show that CIM based parallel adder can achieve at least two orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, energy efficiency and area efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180587","startPage":"57","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180587","endPage":"62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation-in-memory based parallel adder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Computation-in-memory based parallel adder","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180587/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15347225","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation-in-memory based parallel adder","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP01306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078769S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180588,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Imani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Imani","id":"37074212000"},{"name":"Shruti Patil","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Shruti","lastName":"Patil","id":"37085565097"},{"name":"Tajana Simunic Rosing","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Tajana Simunic","lastName":"Rosing","id":"37295875800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7849-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"7180588","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180588","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","SRAM cells","Logic gates","FinFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","memory architecture","MOSFET","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FinFET","SRAM array","SRAM cell","cache architecture","memory design","invert coding scheme","adaptive back-gate feedback","cache power consumption","size 20 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","FinFET","NBTI","Process Variations"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new FinFET based SRAM cell and a cache architecture that efficiently exploits our SRAM cell for low-power and robust memory design.

These models have been fit to specific devices, but the resulting device models are not often discussed in relation to specific applications. A common tool in neuromorphic algorithms, crossbar architectures rely exclusively on the electrical properties of the device connecting rows to columns. Using memristors for these connections, we investigate the viability of 14 device models found in literature for this application. We look at these device models in a crossbar architecture, with supporting circuitry clocked at 500 MHz and providing voltages up to 4V. The two primary functions of a crossbar, evaluating and updating, are both addressed in the context of Rozell et al.'s neuromorphic, Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) learning the MNIST dataset and are used to identify the practical qualities of different memristor models. We establish guidelines for designing crossbars regardless of individual device characteristics, and identify a class of devices that produce energy savings when write voltage is relaxed.

Memristor is one of the promising candidates due to its scalability, non-volatility, practically zero leakage, high integration density, etc. Several applications have been proposed for the memristor crossbar architecture; examples are neuromophic, memories and logic circuits. This paper proposes a generic and flexible interconnect network for memristor-based logic circuits within a crossbar architecture. The scheme is based on the use of reserved memristors (within the crossbar) and the execution of copy operations from and/or to the reserved memristors; it can be applied both at intra-tile as well as inter-tile level, where a tile is a basic block performing a simple logic function. To illustrate the potential of the proposed scheme, two intra-tile and one inter-tile case study are evaluated using SPICE simulation, and their incurred costs are analyzed; the case studies consist of interconnect networks for (a) a specific function within a tile (i.e., the matrix transpose), (b) generic logic functions within a tile, and (c) communication between tiles.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180598","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180598.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnect networks for memristor crossbar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interconnect networks for memristor crossbar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15347232","htmlLink":"/document/7180598/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnect networks for memristor crossbar","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP02432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073325S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180599,"authors":[{"name":"Alvaro Velasquez","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Velasquez","id":"37085422006"},{"name":"Sumit Kumar Jha","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Sumit Kumar","lastName":"Jha","id":"37857266900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7849-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"7180599","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180599","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Nanoscale devices","Wires","Boolean functions","Nanowires","Computer architecture","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","digital arithmetic","digital storage","integrated circuit design","integrated memory circuits","memristor circuits","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated synthesis","nanoscale computing","formal methods","HP Labs","digital storage","neuromorphic computing","software infrastructure","Von Neumann architectures","nanoscale memristor crossbars","Boolean computations","compact crossbar designs","Boolean formula"]}],"abstract":"Since the fabrication of nanoscale memristors by HP Labs in 2008, there has been a sustained interest in the use of crossbars of nanoscale memristors for digital storage and neuromorphic computing. However, the same success has not been replicated in the use of crossbars for performing generalpurpose computations that can support the existing software infrastructure originally designed for von Neumann architectures. One of the fundamental challenges facing the exploitation of nanoscale memristor crossbars is the existence of sneak paths. It has been shown that sneak paths can be used to perform Boolean computations in crossbars. However, the human mind can be easily overwhelmed by the large number of sneak paths that may arise in a crossbar. It is not surprising that the size of manually-designed crossbars has been too large for practical applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how formal methods can be used to automatically synthesize compact crossbar designs that employ the sneak paths phenomena as a fundamental design primitive to evaluate Boolean formula.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180599","endPage":"136","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180599.pdf","startPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated synthesis of crossbars for nanoscale computing using formal methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180599/","displayDocTitle":"Automated synthesis of crossbars for nanoscale computing using formal methods","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15347231","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180599/","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated synthesis of crossbars for nanoscale computing using formal methods","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP02529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12021S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180603,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhixi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085414464"},{"name":"Jie Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Han","id":"37556260600"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7849-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"7180603","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":585},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Nanoscale devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS integrated circuits","image processing","integrated circuit design","logic gates","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate adders","transmission gate","inexact computing","power dissipation","integrated circuit design","nanometric CMOS technology","power consumption","power reduction","low-power imprecise applications","logic reduction","critical path delay","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["approximate computing","error rate","low power","error distance","approximate adder"]}],"abstract":"Power dissipation has become a significant concern for integrated circuit design in nanometric CMOS technology. To reduce power consumption, approximate implementations of a circuit have been considered as a potential solution for applications in which strict exactness is not required. In approximate computing, power reduction is achieved through the relaxation of the often demanding requirement of accuracy. In this paper, new approximate adders are proposed for low-power imprecise applications by using logic reduction at the gate level as an approach to relaxing numerical accuracy. Transmission gates are utilized in the designs of two approximate full adders with reduced complexity. A further positive feature of the proposed designs is the reduction of the critical path delay. The approximate adders show advantages in terms of power dissipation over accurate and recently proposed approximate adders. An image processing application is presented using the proposed approximate adders to evaluate the efficiency in power and delay at application level.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180603","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180603.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission gate-based approximate adders for inexact computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180603/","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Transmission gate-based approximate adders for inexact computing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15347223","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180603/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission gate-based approximate adders for inexact computing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP02927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078705S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7180604,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085354525"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"},{"name":"Jie Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Han","id":"37556260600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7849-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"7180604","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":480},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matrix multiplication by an inexact systolic array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180604","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Arrays","Delays","Transistors","Discrete cosine transforms","Complexity theory","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","approximation theory","matrix multiplication","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix multiplication","systolic arrays","inexact full adder cells","processing element","Baugh-Wooley multiplier","circuit level performance","figures of merit","approximate computing","error distance","discrete cosine transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate computing","inexact design","systolic array","matrix multiplication"]}],"abstract":"Different schemes for approximate computing of matrix multiplication (MM) in systolic arrays are presented in this manuscript.

An extensive analysis and simulation-based assessment of three inexact schemes for the PE are pursued with respect to circuit level performance (such as delay, power consumption and number of transistors) and figures of merit of approximate computing (such as the error distance). The execution of MM in each PE results in an inexact computation affecting only the outputs of the same columns, so the extension of inexact computation to a systolic array can also be performed with very limited error. The discrete cosine transform as application of the proposed inexact systolic arrays, is evaluated; simulation results show that the proposed inexact array is very effective, incurring in a small error.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180604","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180604.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Matrix multiplication by an inexact systolic array","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15347235","htmlLink":"/document/7180604/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix multiplication by an inexact systolic array","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP03002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128121S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180605,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafizur Rahman","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Mostafizur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37538086500"},{"name":"Santosh Khasanvis","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Santosh","lastName":"Khasanvis","id":"37706080200"},{"name":"Jiajun Shi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Jiajun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37076570600"},{"name":"Mingyu Li","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Mingyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085350303"},{"name":"Csaba Andras Moritz","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Csaba Andras","lastName":"Moritz","id":"37274532100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7849-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"7180605","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Nanoscale devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fabrics","flexible electronics","integrated circuit design","nanowires","thermal management (packaging)","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D integrated circuit fabric","intrinsic thermal management","2D CMOS","fine-grained vertical nanowire","Skybridge thermal extraction features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D Integrated Circuit","Skybridge","Vertical Nanowire","3-D Thermal Management","Thermal Modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180605","abstract":"Migration to 3-D provides a possible pathway for future Integrated Circuits (ICs) beyond 2-D CMOS, which is at the brink of its own fundamental limits. Partial attempts so far for 3-D integration using die to die and layer to layer stacking do not represent true progression, and suffer from their own challenges with lack of intrinsic thermal management being among the major ones. Our proposal for 3-D IC, Skybridge, is a truly fine-grained vertical nanowire based fabric that solves technology scaling challenges, and at the same time achieves orders of magnitude benefits over 2-D CMOS. Key to Skybridge's 3-D integration is the fabric centric mindset, where device, circuit, connectivity, thermal management and manufacturing issues are co-addressed in a 3-D compatible manner. In this paper we present architected fine-grained 3-D thermal management features that are intrinsic components of the fabric and part of circuit design; a key difference with respect to die-die and layer-layer stacking approaches where thermal management considerations are coarse-grained at system level. Our bottom-up evaluation methodology, with simulations at both device and circuit level, shows that in the best case Skybridge's thermal extraction features are very effective in thermal management, reducing temperature of a heated region by up to 92%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180605.pdf","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180605","startPage":"157","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecting 3-D integrated circuit fabric with intrinsic thermal management features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180605/","displayDocTitle":"Architecting 3-D integrated circuit fabric with intrinsic thermal management features","htmlLink":"/document/7180605/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15347234","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecting 3-D integrated circuit fabric with intrinsic thermal management features","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP03141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049675S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7180606,"authors":[{"name":"Qi An","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon, Ecully, France","Institut d'Electronique Fondamentale, Univ.

For this purpose, spintronic devices are proposed to combine or even replace complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology for the implementation of integrated circuits. One of the most promising solutions is all spin logic (ASL) device, due to a low power consumption, high switching speed and the compatibility with CMOS. In this paper, we propose a one-bit full-adder and a multi-bits adder circuits relying on ASL devices. The performances of the circuits are evaluated with transient simulation using a compact model of ASL devices developed in Cadence.

Migrating to 3-D integrated circuits, though promising, has eluded us due to inherent customization and manufacturing requirements in CMOS that are incompatible with 3-D organization. Skybridge, a fine-grained 3-D IC fabric technology was recently proposed towards this aim, which offers a paradigm shift in technology scaling and design. In this paper we present specifically architected core Skybridge structures to enable fine-grained connectivity in 3-D intrinsically. We develop predictive models for interconnect length distribution for Skybridge, and use them to quantify the benefits in terms of expected reduction in interconnect lengths and repeater counts when compared to 2-D CMOS in 16nm node. Our estimation indicates up to 10x reduction in longest global interconnect length vs. 16nm 2-D CMOS, and up to 2 orders of magnitude reduction in the number of repeaters for a design consisting of 10 million logic gates. These results show great promise in alleviating interconnect bottleneck due to a higher degree of connectivity in 3-D, leading to shorter global interconnects and reduced power and area overhead due to repeater insertion.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180608","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH\u00b415)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164206/7180573/07180608.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2015.7180608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecting connectivity for fine-grained 3-D vertically integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Architecting connectivity for fine-grained 3-D vertically integrated circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15347246","htmlLink":"/document/7180608/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecting connectivity for fine-grained 3-D vertically integrated circuits","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP03437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081029S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7180609,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher H.

Among emerging memristive technologies, a novel device based on organic materials distinguishes itself, in that it can feature several threshold voltages on the same die, and possesses unipolar behavior. In this work, we highlight that these two features can be beneficial for neural network-inspired learning systems. An on-chip supervised learning method for hybrid memristors / CMOS systems - an analogue synaptic array paired with a hybrid learning cell - is extended to the case of this novel organic memristor device. The organic device can be trained with only one pulse per row (two for the entire array) per presentation of input - as compared to four for a bipolar memristor array. The device also works universally- in both the synaptic grid as well as learning cell-paving the way to single die integration. The proposed scheme learns successfully, even while incorporating non-ideal circuit phenomena such as a wide range of parasitic wire resistances and associated sneak paths. These encouraging first results suggest that these multi-threshold, unipolar organic memristive devices are a useful species for inclusion in adaptive next generation electronic systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180609/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180609/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15347251","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Supervised learning with organic memristor devices and prospects for neural crossbar arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised learning with organic memristor devices and prospects for neural crossbar arrays","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP03552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098367S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164206","isNumber":"7180573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164206","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7180573","articleId":"7180609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180611,"authors":[{"name":"D.

multiplexing (OFDM) systems operating over doubly selective wireless channels, a challenging scenario that is likely to happen in modern unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) data links. When the length of the OFDM cyclic prefix (CP) is smaller than the channel order, we propose to employ a blind linear time-varying (LTV) time-domain equalizer, which shortens the channel impulse response of the channel in the minimum mean-output energy (MMOE) sense, requiring only estimation of the second-order statistics of the received data. The equalizer design leverages on the complex-exponential (CE) basis expansion model (BEM) for the doubly selective channel, which naturally leads to a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter implementation. Monte Carlo computer simulations are carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed FRESH-MMOE channel shortener.","doi":"10.1109/MetroAeroSpace.2015.7180718","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Metrology for Aerospace (MetroAeroSpace)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Metrology for Aerospace (MetroAeroSpace)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7159155/7180612/07180718.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MetroAeroSpace.2015.7180718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind LTV shortening of doubly selective OFDM channels for UAS applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180718/","displayDocTitle":"Blind LTV shortening of doubly selective OFDM channels for UAS applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346750","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180718/","conferenceDate":"4-5 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind LTV shortening of doubly selective OFDM channels for UAS applications","confLoc":"Benevento, Italy","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094694S","chronDate":"4-5 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7159155","isNumber":"7180612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7159155","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7180612","articleId":"7180718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180738,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The purpose of this is to find a political operative to provide electrical power to the system in a given period, with reliability and minimal cost. Therefore it is necessary to determine an optimal schedule of generation for each hydroelectric, each range, so that the system meets the demand reliably, avoiding rationing in years of severe drought, and that minimizes the expected cost of operation during the planning, defining an appropriate strategy for thermal complementation. Several optimization algorithms specifically applied to this problem have been developed and are used. Although providing solutions to various problems encountered, these algorithms have some weaknesses, difficulties in convergence, simplification of the original formulation of the problem, or owing to the complexity of the objective function. An alternative to these challenges is the development of techniques for simulation optimization and more sophisticated and reliable, it can assist the planning of the operation. Thus, this paper presents the development of a computational tool (Hydro-AI) for solving optimization problem identified and to provide the User an easy handling. Adopted as intelligent optimization technique Genetic Algorithm (GA) and programming language Java. First made the modeling of the chromosomes, then implemented the function assessment of the problem and the operators involved, and finally the drafting of the graphical interfaces for access to the User. The results with the Genetic Algorithms were compared with the optimization technique nonlinear programming (NLP). Tests were conducted with one, three and seven hydroelectric plants interconnected hydraulically. The results of comparison between the GA and NLP techniques shows that the cost of operating the GA becomes increasingly smaller than the NLP when the number of hydroelectric plants interconnected increases. The program has managed to relate a coherent performance in problem resolution without the need for simplification of the calculations together with the ease of manipulating the parameters of simulation and visualization of output results.","doi":"10.1109/IYCE.2015.7180815","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171533/7180726/07180815.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 5th International Youth Conference on Energy (IYCE)","publicationTitle":"2015 5th International Youth Conference on Energy (IYCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IYCE.2015.7180815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision support system based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the Operation Planning of Hydrothermal Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Decision support system based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the Operation Planning of Hydrothermal Power Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15363137","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7180815/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision support system based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the Operation Planning of Hydrothermal Power Systems","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ribeirodealencarthiagofirstfullpaper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04203S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171533","isNumber":"7180726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171533","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7180726","articleId":"7180815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7180828,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksey Zhukov","affiliation":["Irkutsk State University, Irkutsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Aleksey","lastName":"Zhukov","id":"37085559115"},{"name":"Nikita Tomin","affiliation":["Electric Power System Department, Melentiev Energy Systems Institute, Irkutsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Nikita","lastName":"Tomin","id":"37591076400"},{"name":"Denis Sidorov","affiliation":["Applied Math Department, Melentiev Energy Systems Institute, Irkutsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Sidorov","id":"37409539700"},{"name":"Daniil Panasetsky","firstName":"Daniil","lastName":"Panasetsky","id":"37601425400"},{"name":"Vadim Spirayev","affiliation":["Applied Math Department, Melentiev Energy Systems Institute, Irkutsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Vadim","lastName":"Spirayev","id":"37085561134"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7172-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7171-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7180828","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Security","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Reactive power","Stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","power system dynamic stability","power system measurement","power system reliability","power system security","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid artificial neural network","voltage security evaluation","power system","voltage collapse","voltage instability monitoring","multilayer perceptron","Kohonen neural network","blackout prevention scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power system","voltage instability","artificial neural network","power security","emergency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180828","abstract":"A majority of recent large-scale blackouts have been the consequence of instabilities characterized by sudden voltage collapse phenomena.

Rapid molecular analysis of cfDNA has the potential to change the current practice of medicine, such as in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring the efficacy of cancer treatments. With a combination of AC electrothermal flow and dielectrophoresis, the hybrid electrokinetic microdevice efficiently concentrates cfDNA from blood plasma and other physiological fluids. In this design, the long-range AC electrothermal flow, which is effective in conductive fluids, drives the cfDNA towards the center of the electrode where dielectrophoretic trapping of the cfDNA occurs. Once the cfDNA is collected at the electrode, the concentration in the blood sample can be quantified by fluorescence analysis with an intercalating dye that binds specifically to double-stranded DNA. The effects of the electrokinetic parameters were elucidated to optimize the design of the device. The device was demonstrated to separate high molecular weight DNA from low molecular weight DNA. Quantitative detection of clinically relevant concentrations of cfDNA was achieved in 10 minutes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrokinetics","DNA","Electrodes","Charge carrier processes","Cancer","Blood","Plasmas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biomedical equipment","cancer","DNA","electrochemical electrodes","electrophoresis","fluorescence","microelectrodes","molecular biophysics","molecular weight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physiological samples","hybrid electrokinetic microdevice","circulating cell-free DNA detection","rapid molecular analysis","cancer diagnosis","cancer treatments","dielectrophoresis","blood plasma","physiological fluids","long-range AC electrothermal flow","conductive fluids","dielectrophoretic trapping","fluorescence analysis","intercalating dye","double-stranded DNA","electrokinetic parameters","high molecular weight DNA","cfDNA concentrations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC electrokinetics","circulating cell-free DNA","dielectrophoresis","cancer","AC electrothermal flow"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2015.7180981","publicationTitle":"2015 Transducers - 2015 18th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems (TRANSDUCERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Transducers - 2015 18th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems (TRANSDUCERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168353/7180834/07180981.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2015.7180981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An electrokinetic microdevice for isolation and quantification of circulating cell-free DNA from physiological samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7180981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An electrokinetic microdevice for isolation and quantification of circulating cell-free DNA from physiological samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7180981/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7180981/","accessionNumber":"15362646","conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An electrokinetic microdevice for isolation and quantification of circulating cell-free DNA from physiological samples","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"1370211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053168S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168353","isNumber":"7180834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168353","xplore-issue":"7180834","articleId":"7180981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7181013,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The self powered sensing function is enabled by a newly developed energy-harvester that can generate considerable electric power only when the monitored amplitude of the vibratory acceleration reaches or exceeds a pre-set threshold. The generated electric-energy can be accumulated over time into stored charge to represent the converted kinetic-energy amount of the concerned vibration. The vibration event induced electric energy can drive an RF transmitter to send out alerting signal. Without traditional sensor used, the wireless signal already includes the sensing information. The vibration-threshold triggered generation function can avoid false-alarm caused by ambient vibratory noise.","doi":"10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2015.7181148","publicationTitle":"2015 Transducers - 2015 18th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems (TRANSDUCERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Transducers - 2015 18th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems (TRANSDUCERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168353/7180834/07181148.pdf","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2015.7181148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181148/","displayDocTitle":"A self-powered wireless sensing node for event-driven alerting based on a bi-stable vibration energy harvester","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15362671","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181148/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-powered wireless sensing node for event-driven alerting based on a bi-stable vibration energy harvester","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"3040341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044933S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168353","isNumber":"7180834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168353","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7180834","articleId":"7181148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7181237,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Both models and measurements indicate that the Q of these resonators is only slightly impacted by the doping level, despite being dominated by thermoelastic dissipation (TED), which has a strong dependence on doping-dependent material properties. We compare experimental measurements of Q over a range of temperatures with models for TED, anchor damping and squeeze film damping. We found that the Q of light and heavily-doped resonators can be accounted for by a combination of TED and anchor or squeeze film damping. These results indicate that it is possible to fully account for the damping mechanisms in MEMS resonators if temperature-dependent measurements of Q are compared with models of the important mechanisms including the temperature-dependent materials properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7181348/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15362735","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Damping mechanisms in light and heavy-doped dual-ring and double-ended tuning fork resonators (DETF)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping mechanisms in light and heavy-doped dual-ring and double-ended tuning fork resonators (DETF)","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5042605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06487S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168353","isNumber":"7180834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168353","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7180834","articleId":"7181348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7181396,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Although the framework is general enough to accommodate any type of channel models based on turbulence scattering, the focus of the analysis is on the H-K distribution as such model is very general and valid over a wide range of atmospheric propagation conditions. Using this framework, it is shown that OSM can offer comparable performance with conventional coherent FSO schemes employing spatial diversity at the transmitter or the receiver only, while outperforming the latter in terms of spectral efficiency and hardware complexity.

However, by using multiple receiver beams and employing array processing techniques, this contradiction can be overcome, allowing greater flexibility and a wider range of application requirements to be met. In this paper the use of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) SAR systems for overcoming this contradiction is of interest, and a novel beamformer is proposed for processing in the cross-range direction. In order to fully describe the system, the array manifold vector is utilized, which is a key concept in the design of the beamformer. In particular, this beamformer is a superresolution beamformer capable of forming wide nulls using subspace based approaches and allows the suppression of ambiguities in multiple sets of received undersampled SAR data in the cross-range direction and reconstruction of the Doppler spectrum to form a single unambiguous set of SAR data. Compared to the existing reconstruction algorithm, only a single weighting vector is required for a block of ambiguous Doppler frequencies compared to a weight vector required for each ambiguous Doppler frequency. The capabilities of the proposed beamformer are shown to give an improved performance in ambiguity suppression via computer simulation studies in a representative maritime environment.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465308","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07181634.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"1548","endPage":"1559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Superresolution Wide Null Beamformer for Undersampled Signal Reconstruction in SIMO SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Superresolution Wide Null Beamformer for Undersampled Signal Reconstruction in SIMO SAR","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181634/","volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7181634/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676865","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Superresolution Wide Null Beamformer for Undersampled Signal Reconstruction in SIMO SAR","sourcePdf":"jstsp-manikas-2465308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097857S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7181634","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7181636,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwei Xu","affiliation":["National laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7327073/7181636/7181636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingwei Xu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2010.

It is difficult to handle this range dependence problem in the presence of range ambiguity. Frequency diverse array (FDA) employs a small frequency increment across the array elements, which induces the spatial frequency variant with respect to slant range. Thus, it provides extra degrees-of-freedom in range domain. In this paper, a novel framework of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) radar is established with FDA as the transmit array. In the FDA-STAP radar, the range ambiguous clutter can be discriminated in spatial frequency domain. This is due to the fact that the spatial frequencies of the clutters from different slant ranges are distinguishable even though the range ambiguous clutter is within the same range bin. Simultaneously, the FDA-STAP radar induces secondary range dependence of clutter. To alleviate the secondary range dependence of clutter, a secondary range dependence compensation (SRDC) method is proposed for two cases: 1) the target is assumed in the unambiguous range region and 2) the target is assumed in the ambiguous range region. After the range ambiguous clutter is separated in the spatial frequency domain by using the proposed SRDC method, the traditional clutter compensation approach is applied to further align the spectrum distribution of clutter. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in clutter suppression under range ambiguous clutter scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range Ambiguous Clutter Suppression for Airborne FDA-STAP Radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07181636.pdf","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Range Ambiguous Clutter Suppression for Airborne FDA-STAP Radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7181636/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676863","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range Ambiguous Clutter Suppression for Airborne FDA-STAP Radar","sourcePdf":"jstsp-xu-2465353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086649S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7181636","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7181638,"authors":[{"name":"George R.

System performance can be improved using adaptation between the information extracted from the sensor/processor and the design and transmission of subsequent illuminating waveforms. As such, cognitive radar systems offer much promise. In this paper, we develop a general cognitive radar framework for a radar system engaged in target tracking. The model includes the higher-level tracking processor and specifies the feedback mechanism and optimization criterion used to obtain the next set of sensor data. Both target detection (track initiation/termination) and tracking (state estimation) are addressed. By separating the general principles from the specific application and implementation details, our formulation provides a flexible framework applicable to the general tracking problem. We demonstrate how the general framework may be specialized for a particular problem using a distributed sensor model in which system resources (observation time on each sensor) are allocated to optimize tracking performance. The cognitive radar system is shown to offer significant performance gains over a standard feed-forward system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radar Framework for Target Detection and Tracking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465304","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07181639.pdf","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radar Framework for Target Detection and Tracking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676864","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radar Framework for Target Detection and Tracking","sourcePdf":"jstsp-bell-2465304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051502S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"117","articleId":"7181639","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181644,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Monakov","affiliation":["Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation, Saint Petersburg, Russia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7327073/7181644/7181644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrei Monakov (M\u201906) graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Aviation Instrument Making in 1978.

The method is an alternative to widely used time difference of arrival (TDOA) or correlation-based backprojection method. These methods work under the assumption that the scene is composed of a single or a few widely separated point targets. The new method overcomes this limitation and can reconstruct heterogeneous scenes with extended targets. We assume that the scene of interest is illuminated by a stationary transmitter of opportunity with known illumination direction, but unknown location. We consider two airborne receivers and correlate the fast-time bistatic measurements at each slow-time. This correlation process maps the tensor product of the scene reflectivity with itself to the correlated measurements. Since this tensor product is a rank-one positive semi-definite operator, the image formation lends itself to low-rank matrix recovery techniques. Taking into account additive noise in bistatic measurements, we formulate the estimation of the rank-one operator as a convex optimization with rank constrain. We present a gradient-descent based iterative reconstruction algorithm and analyze its computational complexity. Extensive numerical simulations show that the new method is superior to correlation-based backprojection in reconstructing extended and distributed targets with better geometric fidelity, sharper edges, and better noise suppression.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07181671.pdf","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1582","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2465361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging Using Low-Rank Matrix Recovery Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Passive Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging Using Low-Rank Matrix Recovery Methods","volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7181671/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676872","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181671/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research AFOSR","grantNumber":"FA9550-12-1-0415"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"National Science Foundation NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1218805"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging Using Low-Rank Matrix Recovery Methods","sourcePdf":"jstsp-yazici-2465361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130183S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7181671","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":7181679,"authors":[{"name":"Shaohang Wang","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shaohang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085407197"},{"name":"Baoyun Wang","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Baoyun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292887200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7181679","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1076},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Communication system security","Wireless communication","Energy harvesting","Robustness","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","concave programming","covariance matrices","energy harvesting","iterative methods","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","radiofrequency power transmission","series (mathematics)","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust secure transmit design","MIMO channel","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","multiple input multiple output","energy harvesting","EH receiver","channel state information","precoding matrix","S-procedure","Taylor series approximation techniques","SWIPT","desired receiver","worst case secrecy rate maximization","AN covariance matrix","power splitting ratio","semi-infinite programming","CSI errors","nonconvex problem","iterative algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","MIMO channels","physical layer security","power splitting","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we consider a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where the information sent to the desired receiver (DR) may be wiretapped by the malicious energy harvesting (EH) receivers (potential eavesdroppers). Assuming the channel state information (CSI) of the EH receivers is not perfectly known at the transmitter, we aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate by jointly designing the precoding matrix, AN covariance matrix and power splsplitting ratio, under the constraints of total transmit power and harvested energyitting ratio, under the constraints of total transmit power and harvested energy at receivers. The formulated problem is non-convex and semi-infinite, which is hard to tackle. To solve it, we first deal with the non-convexity caused by CSI errors with the aid of the S-Procedure, and then employ the Taylor series approximation techniques to transfer the nonconvex problem into a convex optimization problem. Based on that, we propose an iterative algorithm with proved convergence to solve the original problem. Simulation results are finconvex optimization problem. Based on that, we propose an iterative algorithmally provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed robust transmit design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Secure Transmit Design in MIMO Channels with Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2015.2464791","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7118269/07181679.pdf","startPage":"2147","endPage":"2151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2015.2464791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7118269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust Secure Transmit Design in MIMO Channels with Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7181679/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15357031","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"the Open research fund of National Mobile Communications Research LaboratoryLaboratory Southeast University","grantNumber":"2012D05"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271232"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Secure Transmit Design in MIMO Channels with Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-2464791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123302S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7118269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7118269","articleId":"7181679","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181682,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanheng Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xuanheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085636584"},{"name":"Yi Sun","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404475400"},{"name":"Nan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38516823600"},{"name":"F.

However, to achieve IA, users have to bear heavy burdens, such as providing enough dimensions, acquiring global channel statement information and affording high computational complexity, which makes IA difficult to apply in practical networks. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a centralized IA (CIA) scheme, where a relay is employed to off-load the burden of mobile users, i.e., interferences are aligned only by the relay. Furthermore, considering that the receivers still need to zero-force the aligned interference, another scheme called centralized zero-forcing (CZF) is proposed to further reduce the burden of the receivers. Closed-form solutions and feasibility conditions of both schemes are presented. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Interference Alignment Scheme With a Full-Duplex MIMO Relay","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2465381","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7294672/07181682.pdf","startPage":"1798","endPage":"1801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2465381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Interference Alignment Scheme With a Full-Duplex MIMO Relay","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7181682/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520369","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61201224 and 61372089"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT14QY44"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Interference Alignment Scheme With a Full-Duplex MIMO Relay","sourcePdf":"lcomm-sun-2465381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068513S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7294672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7294672","articleId":"7181682","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181693,"authors":[{"name":"Mien Van","affiliation":["Advanced Robotic Centre, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7317673/7181693/van-2450352-small.gif","p":["Mien Van received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Danang University of Technology, Da Nang, Vietnam, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea, in 2015.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Advanced Robotic Centre, Faculty Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Linear local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA) has recently been developed as a popular method for feature extraction and DR. However, the linear method tends to give undesired results if the samples between classes are nonlinearly separated in the input space. To enhance the performance of LFDA in bearing defect classification, a new feature extraction and DR algorithm based on wavelet kernel LFDA (WKLFDA) is presented in this paper. Herein, a new wavelet kernel function is proposed to construct the kernel function of LFDA. To seek the optimal parameters for WKLFDA, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used; as a result, a new PSO-WKLFDA algorithm is proposed. The experimental results for the synthetic data and measured vibration bearing data show that the proposed WKLFDA and PSO-WKLFDA outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583802","htmlLink":"/document/7181693/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Kernel Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis With Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Bearing Defect Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Kernel Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis With Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Bearing Defect Classification","sourcePdf":"tim-kang-2450352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109554S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7317673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7317673","articleId":"7181693","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181700,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics, Beijing, China","College of Mathematics and Systems Science, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7543555/7181700/liang-2460117-small.gif","p":["Xiao Liang was born in Sishui, China.

The criteria can be used as theoretic guidance to stabilize DRDHNNs in practical applications when infinite dimensional noise is taken into consideration.

In this paper, a novel approach of using both quantity and type of molecules to convey information is considered. An asynchronous threshold-based detection algorithm, called count-to-a-threshold (CTAT), is proposed and compared to the baseline detection approach of majority-counting (MC), which simply counts and compares the number of each type of molecule received. The MC detection algorithm, although straightforward and simple, cannot deliver satisfactory performance under the diffusion channel due to the randomness of the arriving time of molecules. On the other hand, the proposed CTAT detection, which exploits properties of the diffusion channel, greatly improves the performance of quantity-type-modulated diffusion-based molecular communication systems. Both simulations and theoretical analysis are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CTAT detection scheme with and without background noise. Based on the analysis, guidelines to design proper molecule quantities, bit intervals, and block sizes to optimize the CTAT detection system are provided.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687308/7096853/07181701.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7096853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Threshold-Based Detection for Quantity-Type-Modulated Molecular Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181701/","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Threshold-Based Detection for Quantity-Type-Modulated Molecular Communication Systems","volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15583902","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181701/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Excellent Research Projects of National Taiwan University","grantNumber":"104R890846"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-002-090"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Threshold-Based Detection for Quantity-Type-Modulated Molecular Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tmbmc-lin-2465520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104069S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687308","isNumber":"7096853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687308","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7096853","articleId":"7181701","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181707,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power System, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7181707/zhang-small.gif","p":["Yiming Zhang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electrical\n engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree\n in electrical engineering in the State Key Laboratory of Power System.","His research interests include wireless power transfer and resonant converters."]},"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38667947500"},{"name":"Kainan Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power System, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7181707/chen-small.gif","p":["Kainan Chen (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D.\n degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University.

Two cases are studied: both the transmitter and the receiver are under resonance, and only the receiver is under resonance. In the latter case, the transmitter is set to be inductive for the implementation of zero voltage switching. The battery current, the output power, and the transfer efficiency of both cases are analyzed and compared in detail. The voltage gain, the power factor, and the output power of the latter case are studied to offer physical insights and design guidelines.

DRIH-MAC is developed based on the following principles: 1) communication starts via the receiver with the goal of maximizing the energy utilization; 2) the distributed scheme for accessing the medium is designed based on graph coloring; and 3) communication scheduling works in coordination with the energy harvesting process. DRIH-MAC is based on a probabilistic scheme to create a scalable and light-weight solution, which minimizes collisions and maximizes the utilization of harvested energy, and can be used in a wide variety of applications. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of DRIH- MAC in a sample medical monitoring application. In particular, DRIH-MAC can improve energy utilization by 50% as compared to a random MAC protocol. Furthermore, it can satisfy application requirements such as delay, even with low energy harvesting rates.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7096853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687308/7096853/07181714.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRIH-MAC: A Distributed Receiver-Initiated Harvesting-Aware MAC for Nanonetworks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"DRIH-MAC: A Distributed Receiver-Initiated Harvesting-Aware MAC for Nanonetworks","volume":"1","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181714/","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15583907","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181714/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1404677, IIS-1404673 and CNS-1355505"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRIH-MAC: A Distributed Receiver-Initiated Harvesting-Aware MAC for Nanonetworks","sourcePdf":"tmbmc-mohrehkesh-2465519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121957S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687308","isNumber":"7096853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687308","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7096853","articleId":"7181714","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7181716,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Bedeer","affiliation":["School of Engineering, the University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7464742/7181716/bedee-small.gif","p":["Ebrahim Bedeer received the BSc and MSc degrees from Tanta\n University, Tanta, Egypt, in 2002 and 2008, respectively and the PhD degree from Memorial University, St. Johns, NL,\n Canada in 2014, all in electrical engineering.

More specifically, we propose to simultaneously maximize the throughput and minimize the transmit power of an OFDM system subject to average bit error rate (BER), power budget, and maximum allocated number of bits per subcarrier constraints. The formulated optimization problem is not convex and we use an evolutionary algorithm, i.e., genetic algorithm, in order to obtain the solution. We study the structure of the problem and the obtained solution and notice that the constraint on the average BER can be replaced by a BER per subcarrier constraint. As such, we propose an approximate non-convex optimization problem. We further exploit the structure of the approximate optimization problem and notice that the BER constraint per subcarrier (i.e., the source of the non-convexity) must be satisfied with an equality sign and can be substituted; this leads to an equivalent convex optimization problem where the global optimality of the Pareto solutions is guaranteed. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the bit and power allocations with reduced complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed multiobjective optimization approach provides significant performance improvements over single objective optimization techniques presented in the literature, without incurring additional complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2465393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7464742/07181716.pdf","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2465393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7464742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Approach to Jointly Optimize Rate and Power Consumption for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181716/","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Approach to Jointly Optimize Rate and Power Consumption for OFDM Systems","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2016","accessionNumber":"16023172","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181716/","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Approach to Jointly Optimize Rate and Power Consumption for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tmc-bedeer-2465393-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120007S","chronDate":"June 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7464742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7464742","articleId":"7181716","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181717,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Qian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4275028/7358220/7181717/szhan-2465371-small.gif","p":["\n\nSai Qian Zhang received the B.A.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Master's degree.

We propose a routing algorithm and a method for building an appropriate multicast topology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing Algorithms for Network Function Virtualization Enabled Multicast Topology on SDN","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2015.2465371","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/7358220/07181717.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2015.2465371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Routing Algorithms for Network Function Virtualization Enabled Multicast Topology on SDN","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7181717/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663035","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing Algorithms for Network Function Virtualization Enabled Multicast Topology on SDN","sourcePdf":"tnsm-zhang-2465371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138504S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"7358220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7358220","articleId":"7181717","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181718,"authors":[{"name":"Haeyoung Lee","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7181718/lee-2465388-small.gif","p":["\n\nHaeyoung Lee received the M.Sc. degree in information and communication \nengineering from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Korea.

In opportunistic spectrum access with imperfect sensing of idle primary spectrum, secondary transmission can collide with primary transmission. When the secondary network aggregates more channels in the presence of the imperfect sensing, collisions could occur more often, limiting the performance obtained by spectrum aggregation. In this context, we aim to address the following fundamental query: How much spectrum aggregation is worthy with imperfect sensing? For collision occurrence, we focus on two different types of collision: One is imposed by asynchronous transmission, and the other is imposed by imperfect spectrum sensing. The collision probability expression has been derived in closed form with various secondary network parameters: primary traffic load, secondary user transmission parameters, spectrum sensing errors, and number of aggregated subchannels. In addition, the impact of spectrum aggregation on data rate is analyzed under the constraint of collision probability. Then, we solve an optimal spectrum aggregation problem and propose the dynamic spectrum aggregation approach to increase the data rate subject to practical collision constraints. Our simulation results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark that passively aggregates subchannels with lack of collision awareness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7181718/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141175","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Practical Spectrum Aggregation for Secondary Networks With Imperfect Sensing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC/DST India-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Spectrum Aggregation for Secondary Networks With Imperfect Sensing","sourcePdf":"tvt-lee-2465388-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101798S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7181718","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181723,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Noel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687308/7096853/7181723/noel-2465511-small.gif","p":["\n\nAdam Noel (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree from Memorial University and the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

Furthermore, prospective applications might rely on the timely detection of changes in the local system parameters. This paper studies the local estimation of channel parameters for diffusive molecular communication when a transmitter releases molecules that are observed by a receiver. The Fisher information matrix of the joint parameter estimation problem is derived so that the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the variance of locally unbiased estimation can be found. The joint estimation problem can be reduced to the estimation of any subset of the channel parameters. Maximum likelihood estimation leads to closed-form solutions for some single-parameter estimation problems and can otherwise be determined numerically. Peak-based estimators are proposed for low-complexity estimation of a single unknown parameter.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7096853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687308/7096853/07181723.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Parameter Estimation via Diffusive Molecular Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Parameter Estimation via Diffusive Molecular Communication","volume":"1","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181723/","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15583908","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181723/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Parameter Estimation via Diffusive Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"tmbmc-noel-2465511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141412S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687308","isNumber":"7096853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687308","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7096853","articleId":"7181723","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7181729,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology Eindhoven, Eindhoven, MB, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7234979/7181729/7181729-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qian Ma (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2008, and the M.S. degrees (cum laude) in electrical engineering from the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2010.","He worked as a Ph.D. candidate from October 2010 with the Mixed-Signal Microeletronics Group, TU/e, The Netherlands.

The method proposed in this paper is a hybrid approach that combines FPGA partial reconfiguration and extra logic added to the circuit under test, without modifying its operation. This approach has been integrated into a fault-injection platform, named NESSY (Non intrusive ErrorS injection SYstem), developed by our research group. Finally, this paper includes results on a Virtex-5 FPGA demonstrating the validity of the method on the ITC'99 benchmark set and a Feed-Forward Equalization (FFE) filter. In comparison with other approaches in the literature, this methodology reduces the resource consumption introduced to carry out the fault injection in FFs, at the cost of adding very little time overhead ( 1.6 \u03bcs per fault).","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2447391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7203194/07181741.pdf","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2447391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology to Emulate Single Event Upsets in Flip-Flops Using FPGAs through Partial Reconfiguration and Instrumentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181741/","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology to Emulate Single Event Upsets in Flip-Flops Using FPGAs through Partial Reconfiguration and Instrumentation","volume":"62","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181741/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15365061","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology to Emulate Single Event Upsets in Flip-Flops Using FPGAs through Partial Reconfiguration and Instrumentation","sourcePdf":"tns-clemente-2447391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085425S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7203194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7203194","articleId":"7181741","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7181742,"authors":[{"name":"Nadia Rezzak","affiliation":["Microsemi SOC, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nadia","lastName":"Rezzak","id":"37586421300"},{"name":"Jih-Jong Wang","affiliation":["Microsemi SOC, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jih-Jong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280536900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"7181742","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":604},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doping","Integrated circuit modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Layout","SRAM cells","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","radiation hardening (electronics)","semiconductor device manufacture","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single event latch-up hardening","SEL","TCAD simulations","embedded SRAM","flash-based field programmable gate arrays","flash-based FPGA","3D TCAD simulation","high volume manufacturing","size 130 nm","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-TCAD simulation","flash-based FPGA","single event latch-up","SRAMs"]}],"abstract":"In this work 3D-TCAD simulation is used to investigate and harden single event latch-up (SEL) occurring in embedded SRAMs, in both 130 nm and 65 nm Flash-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

One important new finding is that depending on the technology node, the number of SRAM cells included in the 3D structure significantly affects the SEL threshold. The number of SRAM cells needs to be optimized for accurate SEL prediction within a reasonable simulation time.The simulation results are validated using heavy ion and neutron data. After trade-off studies, process mitigation solutions are chosen to improve the SEL threshold in 65 nm and achieve immunity in neutron environment.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2450210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7203194/07181742.pdf","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2450210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Event Latch-Up Hardening Using TCAD Simulations in 130\u00a0nm and 65\u00a0nm Embedded SRAM in Flash-Based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181742/","displayDocTitle":"Single Event Latch-Up Hardening Using TCAD Simulations in 130\u00a0nm and 65\u00a0nm Embedded SRAM in Flash-Based FPGAs","volume":"62","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181742/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15365069","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Event Latch-Up Hardening Using TCAD Simulations in 130\u00a0nm and 65\u00a0nm Embedded SRAM in Flash-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tns-rezzak-2450210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070846S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7203194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7203194","articleId":"7181742","onlineDate":"06 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7181743,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Pahl","affiliation":["Keysight Technologies, Santa Rosa, CA, USA","Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics (IHE), Karlsruhe, BW"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Pahl","id":"37573011200"},{"name":"Sandrine Wagner","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAF), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandrine","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37958866300"},{"name":"Hermann Massler","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAF), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Massler","id":"37293768500"},{"name":"Sebastian Diebold","affiliation":["Osaka University, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Toyonaka, Japan","KIT, IHE, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Diebold","id":"37591220200"},{"name":"Arnulf Leuther","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAF), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Arnulf","lastName":"Leuther","id":"37293981900"},{"name":"Ingmar Kallfass","affiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Institute of Robust Power Semiconductor Systems (ILH), Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Ingmar","lastName":"Kallfass","id":"37267397800"},{"name":"Thomas Zwick","affiliation":["KIT, IHE, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zwick","id":"37273510500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7181743","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1019},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Bandwidth","Power generation","Power amplifiers","Impedance","Power transmission lines","Microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","millimetre wave power amplifiers","MMIC power amplifiers","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed gain cells","monolithic millimeter-wave integrated circuit power amplifier","V-band","W-band","F-band","magnetic distributed transformers","traveling wave gain cells","frequency 50 GHz to 146 GHz","gain 12 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","broadband matching networks","broadband MMIC","microwave and millimeter-wave circuits","millimeter-wave power amplification","transformers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181743","abstract":"A monolithic millimeter-wave integrated circuit power amplifier covering the entire V-, W- and F-band is presented.

Gradient algorithm is recently proposed and generally belongs to convex optimization class of algorithms. It is an iterative algorithm where missing samples are reconstructed by using a procedure of gradient-based concentration improvement. The proposed scheme assumes that sparse domain of signal is Discrete Fourier domain. It is interesting to note that this algorithm performs well even in the case of almost sparse signals. The proposed architecture could be modified easily for other transform domains. The scheme is composed of blocks that are suitable for FPGA implementation.

Slow acquisition process requires patient to be long time exposed to scanning apparatus. In recent years significant efforts are made towards the applying Compressive Sensing technique to the acquisition process of MRI and biomedical images. Compressive Sensing is an emerging theory in signal processing. It aims to reduce the amount of acquired data required for successful signal reconstruction. Reducing the amount of acquired image coefficients leads to lower acquisition time, i.e. time of exposition to the MRI apparatus. Using optimization algorithms, satisfactory image quality can be obtained from the small set of acquired samples. A number of optimization algorithms for the reconstruction of the biomedical images is proposed in the literature. In this paper, three commonly used optimization algorithms are compared and results are presented on the several MRI images.","doi":"10.1109/MECO.2015.7181928","publicationTitle":"2015 4th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 4th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164208/7181853/07181928.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MECO.2015.7181928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181853","startPage":"303","endPage":"306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of algorithms for compressed sensing of magnetic resonance images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of algorithms for compressed sensing of magnetic resonance images","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181928/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15363416","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7181928/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of algorithms for compressed sensing of magnetic resonance images","confLoc":"Budva, Montenegro","sourcePdf":"69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05306S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164208","isNumber":"7181853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164208","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7181853","articleId":"7181928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7181930,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Mileti\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Mileti\u0107","id":"37085453763"},{"name":"Nemanja Ivanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro"],"firstName":"Nemanja","lastName":"Ivanovi\u0107","id":"37085471274"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1976-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8999-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8998-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-5475"}],"articleNumber":"7181930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Time-frequency analysis","Compressed sensing","Vehicles","Algorithm design and analysis","Streaming media","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","estimation theory","image motion analysis","time-frequency analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing based velocity estimation","video data","moving vehicle velocity estimation","sparse reconstruction algorithms","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","signal reconstruction","video frames","velocity estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the use of compressive sensing based algorithms for velocity estimation of moving vehicles.

Namely, the signal denoising is done by averaging the reconstructed signal versions obtained in different iterations based on different subsets of random samples. The analysis of output SNR is done is terms of the number of iterations required for successful results. The influence of the number of random samples used in the iterations is analyzed as well.

Compressive Sensing is new approach in signal processing whose basic idea is recovering signal form small set of available samples. The application of the Compressive Sensing in biomedical imaging has found great importance. It allows significant lowering of the acquisition time, and therefore, save the patient from the negative impact of the MR apparatus. TwIST is commonly used algorithm for 2D signals reconstruction using Compressive Sensing principle. It is based on the Total Variation minimization. Standard version of the TwIST uses masked 2D Discrete Fourier Transform coefficients as Compressive Sensing measurements. In this paper, different masks and different transformation domains for coefficients selection are tested. Certain percent of the measurements is used from the mask, as well as small number of coefficients outside the mask. Comparative analysis using 2D DFT and 2D DCT coefficients, with different mask shapes is performed. The theory is proved with experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI using masked DCT and DFT measurements","publicationTitle":"2015 4th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","doi":"10.1109/MECO.2015.7181934","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 4th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164208/7181853/07181934.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MECO.2015.7181934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI using masked DCT and DFT measurements","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181934/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15363500","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing MRI using masked DCT and DFT measurements","confLoc":"Budva, Montenegro","sourcePdf":"74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066815S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164208","isNumber":"7181853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164208","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7181853","articleId":"7181934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7181990,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Kiouseloglou","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell'Informazione, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy","CEA, LETI, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Kiouseloglou","id":"37085425583"},{"name":"Gabriele Navarro","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Navarro","id":"37902716000"},{"name":"Alessandro Cabrini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell'Informazione, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Cabrini","id":"37272735500"},{"name":"Luca Perniola","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Perniola","id":"37268200500"},{"name":"Guido Torelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell'Informazione, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Torelli","id":"37085403319"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7181990","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized temperature profile based pulse generator for innovative Phase Change Memory","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7157844/7181973/07181990.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7181990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181973","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7181990","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Resistance","Programming","Phase change memory","Pulse generation","Crystallization","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antimony compounds","germanium compounds","phase change memories","pulse generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SET state resistance distribution dispersion","phase change memory","innovative materials","Ge-rich Ge2Sb2Te5","post-layout simulations","PCM cells programming","alternative-to-GST materials","temperature profile based pulse generator","Ge2Sb2Te6"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181990","abstract":"In this paper, we discuss the increase of the SET state resistance distribution dispersion in Phase Change Memory (PCM) based on innovative materials, namely Ge-rich Ge\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nSb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nTe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sub>\n (GST).

For example, recent neural models defined by neuro-scientists exhibit interesting properties for an execution in embedded and autonomous systems: distributed computing, unsupervised learning, self-adaptation, self-organisation, tolerance. But these properties only emerge from large scale and fully connected neural maps that result in intensive computation coupled with high synaptic communications. We are interested in deploying these powerful models in the embedded context of an autonomous bio-inspired robot learning its environment in realtime. So we study in this paper in what extent these complex models can be simplified and deployed in hardware accelerators compatible with an embedded integration. Thus we propose a Neural Processing Unit designed as a programmable accelerator implementing recent equations close to self-organizing maps and neural fields. The proposed architecture is validated on FPGA devices and compared to state of the art solutions. The trade-off proposed by this dedicated but programmable neural processing unit allows to achieve significant improvements and makes our architecture adapted to many embedded systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7157844/7181973/07181997.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7181997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7181997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7181997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware design of a neural processing unit for bio-inspired computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Neurons","Adaptation models","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","neural chips","robots","self-organising feature maps","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design","bio-inspired computing","unsupervised artificial neural networks","autonomous systems","embedded systems","distributed computing","unsupervised learning","fully connected neural maps","high synaptic communications","hardware accelerators","embedded integration","programmable accelerator","self-organizing maps","FPGA devices","programmable neural processing unit","autonomous bio-inspired robot learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hardware design of a neural processing unit for bio-inspired computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7181997/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15363371","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware design of a neural processing unit for bio-inspired computing","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"12A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069625S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7181997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7181998,"authors":[{"name":"Essia Ben Abdallah","affiliation":["CEA, Univ.

Special attention is paid to load-pull optimization to derive suitable values of the antenna input impedance at the operating frequency and the first higher-order harmonics. The impact of the antenna impedance profile in the operational band on PA performance is also addressed. It is found that the PA is more linear, when its operating frequency is below the antenna resonance, compared to other configurations. A microstrip patch antenna which provide the optimal impedance is developed and results demonstrate the benefits of the co-design approach with new antenna.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7181998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7181998/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15363346","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact of small antenna on linear power amplifier performance in a co-design approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of small antenna on linear power amplifier performance in a co-design approach","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"12A6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064532S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7181998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7182000,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Salah","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Salah","id":"37722127700"},{"name":"Yehea Ismail","affiliation":["AUC University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Yehea","lastName":"Ismail","id":"37271363500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7182000","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"abstract":"This paper presents new TSV-Based applications such as resonant inductive coupling, variable Inductor, power amplifier, bandpass filter, and antenna. These proposed systems use a spiral inductor built using TSV technology. The Resonant Inductive Coupling system increases the amount of magnetic flux linked between coils and improves the power transmission significantly. A proposed architecture based on TSV technology for a variable bridge spiral inductor is demonstrated and characterized. Where, we can obtain different values for the inductor according to the switch state, whether it is ON or OFF. In addition, TSV is used to construct transformer-coupled power amplifier. A new architecture for on-chip bandpass filters, based on through silicon via (TSV) technology. This architecture is the first in literature. According to the simulation results, the TSV-based bandpass filter has an insertion loss of 1.5 dB at 90 GHz and 20 GHz passband from 80 to 100 GHz. This band can be tuned by changing the dimensions of the coupled TSVs. TSV are also used to build an antenna on high resistivity substrate. The characteristic of this antenna is a function of TSV diameter, TSV length, and silicon resistivity. Compared to conventional on-chip antennas who suffers from low gain and low radiation efficiency, our novel antenna provides better performance parameters such as higher radiation pattern efficiency and higher gain as the antenna delivers a high gain of 5.8 dBi and the radiation efficiency is 86% over the prescribed range of frequencies. The proposed antenna is centered at 90 GHz with 20 GHz bandwidth. The overall area of the proposed antenna is 400\u03bcm\u00d7100\u03bcm. Building the antenna using TSV technology not only improves the performance, but also improves the isolation between the antenna and other active circuits.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Band-pass filters","Couplings","Silicon","Antennas","Through-silicon vias","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","band-pass filters","inductors","power amplifiers","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TSV-based applications","resonant inductive coupling","variable inductor","antenna","spiral inductor","transformer-coupled power amplifier","on-chip bandpass filters","through silicon via technology","radiation pattern efficiency","loss 1.5 dB","frequency 90 GHz","frequency 20 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Three-Dimensional ICs","Through Silicon Via","TSV","Spiral Inductor","Wireless","Filter","Antenna","Resonance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182000","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7157844/7181973/07182000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New TSV-Based applications: Resonant inductive coupling, variable inductor, power amplifier, bandpass filter, and antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New TSV-Based applications: Resonant inductive coupling, variable inductor, power amplifier, bandpass filter, and antenna","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182000/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182000/","accessionNumber":"15363286","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New TSV-Based applications: Resonant inductive coupling, variable inductor, power amplifier, bandpass filter, and antenna","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"12A8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044417S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7182000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7182005,"authors":[{"name":"Joan Mauricio","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya"],"firstName":"Joan","lastName":"Mauricio","id":"38231843300"},{"name":"Francesc Moll","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya"],"firstName":"Francesc","lastName":"Moll","id":"37299201600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7182005","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":398},"abstract":"Local variations are increasingly important in new technologies.

While embedded memories are typically realized with SRAM, alternative solutions, such as embedded dynamic memories (eDRAM), can provide higher density and/or reduced power consumption. One major challenge that impedes the widespread adoption of eDRAM is that they require frequent refreshes potentially reducing the availability of the memory in periods of high activity and also consuming significant amount of power due to such frequent refreshes. Reducing the refresh rate while on one hand can reduce the power overhead, if not performed in a timely manner, can cause some cells to lose their content potentially resulting in memory errors. In this paper, we consider extending the refresh period of gain-cell based dynamic memories beyond the worst-case point of failure, assuming that the resulting errors can be tolerated when the use-cases are in the domain of inherently error-resilient applications. For example, we observe that for various data mining applications, a large number of memory failures can be accepted with tolerable imprecision in output quality. In particular, our results indicate that by allowing as many as 177 errors in a 16 kB memory, the maximum loss in output quality is 11%. We use this failure limit to study the impact of relaxing reliability constraints on memory availability and retention power for different technologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182027/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182027/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15363263","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approximate computing with unreliable dynamic memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate computing with unreliable dynamic memories","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"15B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052486S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7182027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7182028,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Camus","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory (ICLAB), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Camus","id":"37085411128"},{"name":"Jeremy Schlachter","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory (ICLAB), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Schlachter","id":"37085420936"},{"name":"Christian Enz","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory (ICLAB), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Enz","id":"37085390786"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7182028","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182028","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Logic gates","Accuracy","Error analysis","Delays","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital circuits","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient digital design","arithmetic circuits","circuit design","digital systems","error tolerant applications","arithmetic units","circuit pruning","carry speculation"]}],"abstract":"Inexact and approximate circuit design is a promising approach to improve performance and energy efficiency in technology-scaled and low-power digital systems.

Reducing this excessive guardband is highly desirable, but causes timing errors in synchronous circuits. We propose a methodology for supervised learning based models to predict timing errors at bit-level. We show that a logistic regression based model can effectively predict timing errors, for a given amount of guardband reduction. The proposed methodology enables a model-based rule method to reduce guardband subject to a required bit-level reliability specification. For predicting timing errors at bit-level, the proposed model generation automatically uses a binary classifier per output bit that captures the circuit path sensitization. We train and test our model on gate-level simulations with timing error information extracted from an ASIC flow that considers physical details of placed-and-routed single-precision pipelined floating-point units (FPUs) in 45nm TSMC technology. We further assess the robustness of our modeling methodology by considering various operating voltage and temperature corners. Our model predicts timing errors with an average accuracy of 95% for unseen input workload.

Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices will operate in very different power-performance modes, from sub-MHz to peaks of hundreds of MHz. The nano-power range which is achievable in deca-nanometer CMOS at near-VT is the alternative we explore for VLSI circuits (8051 processor, filters, and ISCAS benchmark circuits). This paper proposes a method to design CMOS circuits for a wide dynamic range of VFS, and targets near-threshold for best efficiency. A standard-cell based design methodology specific for near-VT is demonstrated here in for a commercial 65nm CMOS process. Power and timing variability are characterized, so that variation-aware and yet ultra-low supply voltage designs are enabled. Our cell design method avoids unnecessary upsizing and it focus on near- and well above threshold regions of operation. For the study cases of medium complexity notch filter design (24kgates), and an 8051 compatible core (20kgates) we demonstrate 63X to 77X energy/operation savings for applications that tolerate ultra-wide frequency scaling (from hundreds of KHz to 1GHz) in their operating modes. The results were obtained using the minimal cycle time achievable at each supply voltage. The extremely low and highly-variable performance at sub- and near-VT have to be addressed by new logic design paradigms. In this paper we also exploit the use of approximate adders to increase the timing performance of a class of digital filter circuits, to enable compensating the performance loss inherent to near-VT operation in CMOS. Our results show that the effort to explore energy savings in low power optimized circuits through the approximate computing approach is validated with energy and worst path delay reductions up to 19.4% and 36.7% respectively, compared to the precise arithmetic implementation, without compromising the filters frequency response. Our approximate adder method enables higher levels of energy efficiency in CMOS VLSI filters.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182030","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7157844/7181973/07182030.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-threshold computing for very wide frequency scaling: Approximate adders to rescue performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Near-threshold computing for very wide frequency scaling: Approximate adders to rescue performance","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15363372","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182030/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-threshold computing for very wide frequency scaling: Approximate adders to rescue performance","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"15B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053985S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7182030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182031,"authors":[{"name":"Lirida Alves de Barros Naviner","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS-UMR 5141, T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Paris Tech, Paris CEDEX, France"],"firstName":"Lirida Alves","lastName":"de Barros Naviner","id":"37601602800"},{"name":"Hao Cai","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS-UMR 5141, T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Paris Tech, Paris CEDEX, France"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Cai","id":"37072611300"},{"name":"You Wang","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS-UMR 5141, T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Paris Tech, Paris CEDEX, France"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085464975"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["IEF, Univ.

By using Current Mode Logic (CML) gates, the power consumption can be reduced to 3.84uW only when the VCO is not running (switch off).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15363350","htmlLink":"/document/7182048/","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-wideband voltage controlled oscillator with commutable phases for BPSK implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-wideband voltage controlled oscillator with commutable phases for BPSK implementation","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"19A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065275S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7182048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182049,"authors":[{"name":"R\u0103zvan-Cristian Marin","affiliation":["IEMN-ISEN, Lille, France"],"firstName":"R\u0103zvan-Cristian","lastName":"Marin","id":"37085465711"},{"name":"Antoine Frapp\u00e9","affiliation":["IEMN-ISEN, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Frapp\u00e9","id":"37688073400"},{"name":"Andreas Kaiser","affiliation":["IEMN-ISEN, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37085448178"},{"name":"Andreia Cathelin","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Andreia","lastName":"Cathelin","id":"37268157800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7182049","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Bandwidth","Transmitters","Power demand","Delays","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulation","integrated circuit design","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed configurable-bandwidth time-interleaved digital delta-sigma modulators","UTBB FDSOI","digital transmitter chain","critical path analysis","time-interleaved channels","size 28 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delta Sigma Modulator (DSM)","time-interleaving","critical path analysis","digital transmitter"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design and simulation of a time-interleaved delta-sigma modulator as part of a digital transmitter chain.

A power detector (PD) is connected directly at the output of the amplifier in order to track the envelope variation of its output signal. The employed PD has a dynamic range of more than 30dB, and a maximum power consumption of 0.8mW. Under constant bias conditions, the PA has a power gain of around 7dB, a maximum PAE of 16%, and an output compression point of around 7.5dBm while driving 25.8mA under 1.2V supply voltage. Under adaptive bias control, the mean value of the DC current is reduced down to 20.8mA, while maintaining high power gain, leading to a significant enhancement of the PAE over the linear input dynamic range of the PA.

This offers many opportunities for implementation of different algorithms of synchronization, depending on the application context and operational conditions. The synchronization algorithm is based on a PI control applied to the phase error measured between neighbors. In this way, the global synchronization is achieved through a local control: such an architecture is compatible with the concept of networks on chip, a largely spread concept in the worlds of VLSI circuits. The paper presents two prototypes demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the proposed solution for synchronization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7157844/7181973/07182059.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed synchronization of all-digital PLLs network for clock generation in synchronous SOCs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Phase locked loops","Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes","Clocks","System-on-chip","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital circuits","phase locked loops","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed synchronization","all-digital PLL network","clock generation","synchronous SOC","CMOS oscillators","digital systems on chip","digital circuits","global synchronization","networks on chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A distributed synchronization of all-digital PLLs network for clock generation in synchronous SOCs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15363266","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed synchronization of all-digital PLLs network for clock generation in synchronous SOCs","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"19C4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063951S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7182059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182063,"authors":[{"name":"Mickael Fiorentino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"firstName":"Mickael","lastName":"Fiorentino","id":"37085486463"},{"name":"Omar Al-Terkawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Al-Terkawi","id":"38277569700"},{"name":"Yvon Savaria","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"firstName":"Yvon","lastName":"Savaria","id":"37276922900"},{"name":"Claude Thibeault","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole des Technologies Sup\u00e9rieures, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Thibeault","id":"37276569100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7182063","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Field programmable gate arrays","Synchronization","Pipelines","Routing","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-timed circuits FPGA implementation flow","synchronous circuits timing constraints","configurable delay element","static timing analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-timed circuits","FPGA","Hierarchical Design"]}],"abstract":"The conventional synchronous design approach is not suitable for implementing self-timed circuits on FPGAs.

Due to its mixed analog and digital nature, often circuit level simulators are used to characterize its overall nonlinear dynamic behavior. Since the existing analytical methods are not efficient to account non-ideal and non-linear effects. Furthermore, considering a CP-PLL for frequency synthesis function, a low and high frequency part result in very long simulation times. Consequently, Spice like electrical simulator do not provide a quick assessment of the overall non-linear dynamic behavior of the CP-PLL. Additionally the PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature) variations are the most important aspect of the design flow to achieve a robust system. In this paper, a first ever PVT characterization of arbitrary ordered voltage switch charge pump PLLs (VSCP-PLL) designed at transistor level (TL) using 130nm CMOS process is presented. By extracting the macroscopic behavior and initial conditions, the simulations were performed using an efficient Event-Driven (ED) approach. The PVT characterization results of the ED-approach are very close to the TL-simulations with a good agreement in accuracy and speed-up factor of 60,000 &7,000 for 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nd</sup>\n and 3\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rd</sup>\n order PLL is achieved respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15363299","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182081/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling & PVT characterization of arbitrary ordered VSCP-PLL using an efficient event-driven approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling & PVT characterization of arbitrary ordered VSCP-PLL using an efficient event-driven approach","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"7B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04414S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7182081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7182087,"authors":[{"name":"Cl\u00e1udio Machado Diniz","affiliation":["Polytechnic Institute, Catholic University of Pelotas (UCPel), Pelotas, Brazil","PPGC & PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e1udio Machado","lastName":"Diniz","id":"37550679100"},{"name":"Mateus Beck Fonseca","affiliation":["Engineering Center, Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), Pelotas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Mateus","lastName":"Beck Fonseca","id":"37941607400"},{"name":"Eduardo Costa","affiliation":["Polytechnic Institute, Catholic University of Pelotas (UCPel), Pelotas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Costa","id":"37276140200"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["PPGC & PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7182087","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Compressors","Interpolation","Computer architecture","Video coding","Hardware","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","filtering theory","image resolution","integrated circuit design","interpolation","motion estimation","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEVC interpolation filter hardware architecture enhancement","high efficient video coding standard","hierarchical adder compressor structures","fractional-pixel motion estimation","interpolation filter acceleration","interpolation datapaths","area-efficient operators","power-efficient operators","power reduction","power delay reduction","VLSI design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Coding","Hardware Architecture","VLSI Design","Adder compressors"]}],"abstract":"The recent High Efficient Video Coding (HEVC) standard introduces a new and complex interpolation filter for fractional-pixel motion estimation.

SRFFT is known to offer a performance that is better than conventional FFT in terms of reduced number of required complex multiplications and hence, can lead to reduced power consumption. Leveraging this potential, a new architecture of a configurable SRFFT processor is first devised and then the architecture is developed further so that unnecessary computations, which yield zeros at the output, are pruned. This is done through stalling butterfly computations with appropriate use of a pruning matrix. The proposed processor may find applications in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication transceivers, where transmitted signals may occupy only a small portion of the whole operational spectrum. The processor is implemented on a field-programmable gate array and simulations show that maximum power saving of around 20% is achieved when computing 1024 point Fourier transform of signals with very sparse spectrum.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7157844/7181973/07182096.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-efficient hardware architecture for computing Split-Radix FFTs on highly sparsed spectrum","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Computer architecture","Power demand","Random access memory","OFDM","Cognitive radio","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-efficient hardware architecture","Split-Radix FFT","highly sparsed spectrum","fast Fourier transform","butterfly computations","pruning matrix","OFDM communication transceivers","field-programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fourier transform","processor","power saving","pruning","split-radix","sparse spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power-efficient hardware architecture for computing Split-Radix FFTs on highly sparsed spectrum","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182096/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15363311","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-efficient hardware architecture for computing Split-Radix FFTs on highly sparsed spectrum","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"8B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043081S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7157844","isNumber":"7181973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7157844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7181973","articleId":"7182096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182097,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wu","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Center of Excellence, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085418940"},{"name":"Ching Chuen Jong","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Center of Excellence, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ching Chuen","lastName":"Jong","id":"37270713000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7182097","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Approximation methods","Hardware","Graphics","Complexity theory","Adders","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","dividing circuits","optimisation","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noniterative divider circuits","curve fitting approach","accuracy trade-off","performance trade-off","area-delay product","square-triangular plane","accuracy optimization","arithmetic operations","look-up table","maximum absolute error percentage","MAEP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182097","abstract":"This paper presents an approach based on the curve fitting method for the design of non-iterative divider circuits with accuracy and area-delay product (ADP) trade-offs.

The planes are obtained by using the curve fitting method for accuracy optimization. The proposed architecture for implementing the planes contains only simple arithmetic operations and a look-up table. Several non-iterative divider circuits with different accuracies and ADPs are obtained. The accuracy achieved in terms of the maximum absolute error percentage (MAEP) ranges from 1.87% to 0.14%.

The sole aim is to yield a single fused image, which could be more informative for an efficient clinical analysis. This paper presents a two-stage multimodal fusion framework using the cascaded combination of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and non sub-sampled Contourlet transform (NSCT) domains for images acquired using two distinct medical imaging sensor modalities (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan). The major advantage of using a cascaded combination of SWT and NSCT is to improve upon the shift variance, directionality, and phase information in the finally fused image. The first stage employs a principal component analysis algorithm in SWT domain to minimize the redundancy. Maximum fusion rule is then applied in NSCT domain at second stage to enhance the contrast of the diagnostic features. A quantitative analysis of fused images is carried out using dedicated fusion metrics. The fusion responses of the proposed approach are also compared with other state-of-the-art fusion approaches; depicting the superiority of the obtained fusion results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Medical Image Sensor Fusion Framework Using Cascade of Wavelet and Contourlet Transform Domains","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2465935","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07182254.pdf","startPage":"6783","endPage":"6790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2465935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Medical Image Sensor Fusion Framework Using Cascade of Wavelet and Contourlet Transform Domains","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7182254/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488985","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Medical Image Sensor Fusion Framework Using Cascade of Wavelet and Contourlet Transform Domains","sourcePdf":"jsen-bhateja-2465935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188504S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7182254","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182258,"authors":[{"name":"Luis G\u00f3mez-Chova","affiliation":["Image Processing Laboratory (IPL), Universitat de Val\u00e9ncia, Val\u00e9ncia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7214335/7182258/gomez-2449668-small.gif","p":["\nLuis G\u00f3mez-Chova (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

Multiple and heterogeneous image sources can be available for the same geographical region: multispectral, hyperspectral, radar, multitemporal, and multiangular images can today be acquired over a given scene. These sources can be combined/fused to improve classification of the materials on the surface. Even if this type of systems is generally accurate, the field is about to face new challenges: the upcoming constellations of satellite sensors will acquire large amounts of images of different spatial, spectral, angular, and temporal resolutions. In this scenario, multimodal image fusion stands out as the appropriate framework to address these problems. In this paper, we provide a taxonomical view of the field and review the current methodologies for multimodal classification of remote sensing images. We also highlight the most recent advances, which exploit synergies with machine learning and signal processing: sparse methods, kernel-based fusion, Markov modeling, and manifold alignment. Then, we illustrate the different approaches in seven challenging remote sensing applications: 1) multiresolution fusion for multispectral image classification; 2) image downscaling as a form of multitemporal image fusion and multidimensional interpolation among sensors of different spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions; 3) multiangular image classification; 4) multisensor image fusion exploiting physically-based feature extractions; 5) multitemporal image classification of land covers in incomplete, inconsistent, and vague image sources; 6) spatiospectral multisensor fusion of optical and radar images for change detection; and 7) cross-sensor adaptation of classifiers. The adoption of these techniques in operational settings will help to monitor our planet from space in the very near future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","volume":"103","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15383212","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182258/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Classification of Remote Sensing Images: A Review and Future Directions","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003359","fundingName":"Generalitat Valenciana"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"PP00P2_150593"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)"},{"fundingName":"Italian Space Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Classification of Remote Sensing Images: A Review and Future Directions","sourcePdf":"jproc-gomezchova-2449668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.296591S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7214335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"7214335","articleId":"7182258","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7182260,"authors":[{"name":"Jingcheng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New York Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Jingcheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085742627"},{"name":"Ziqian Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New York Institute of Technology New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ziqian","lastName":"Dong","id":"38259669500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7182260","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents three measurement approaches for three-dimensional (3-D) inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of rotating objects on a pylon in compact antenna test range.

In inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging based on the CPS model, the chirp rate and the quadratic chirp rate are identified as causes of the image defocus. In this paper, by employing a novel parametric symmetric self-correlation function and the keystone transform, an effective estimation algorithm, known as the modified Lv's distribution (MLVD), is presented for the CPS and applied to ISAR imaging of targets with complex motions. The MLVD is simple and can be easily implemented using the complex multiplication, the fast-Fourier transform (FFT), and the inverse FFT (IFFT). The implementation, the cross-term, the antinoise performance, and the computational cost are analyzed for the MLVD. Compared to three representative estimation algorithms for the CPS, the MLVD can acquire a higher antinoise performance and eliminate the brute-force searching without the interpolation. Through simulations and analyses for synthetic models and the real radar data, we verify the effectiveness of the MLVD and the corresponding ISAR imaging algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Algorithm design and analysis","Fast Fourier transforms","Radar imaging","Inverse synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISAR imaging","modified Lv distribution","cubic phase signal","oceanic waves","Doppler frequencies","multicomponent cubic phase signals","inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging","CPS model","quadratic chirp rate","parametric symmetric self-correlation function","fast-Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cubic phase signal (CPS)","fast-Fourier transform (FFT)","inverse FFT (IFFT)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","modified Lv\u2019s distribution (MLVD)"]},{"kwd":["Cubic phase signal (CPS)","fast-Fourier transform (FFT)","inverse FFT (IFFT)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","modified Lv\u2019s distribution (MLVD)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2460734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7377134/07182265.pdf","startPage":"4775","endPage":"4784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2460734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISAR Imaging of Targets With Complex Motions Based on Modified Lv\u2019s Distribution for Cubic Phase Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ISAR Imaging of Targets With Complex Motions Based on Modified Lv\u2019s Distribution for Cubic Phase Signal","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182265/","volume":"8","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182265/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697218","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61001204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005938","fundingName":"Science and technology Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2012JM8015"},{"fundingName":"Xi\u2019an Polytechnic University Dr Support Foundation","grantNumber":"BS1119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISAR Imaging of Targets With Complex Motions Based on Modified Lv\u2019s Distribution for Cubic Phase Signal","sourcePdf":"jstars-zheng-2460734-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109459S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7377134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7377134","articleId":"7182265","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7182278,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiro Fujita","affiliation":["Technical Computing Solutions Unit, Fujitsu Limited, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37072280100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7182278","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, the implicit Newmark-Beta formulation is partially and magnetically introduced into the explicit leapfrog scheme of Yee's finite-difference time-domain (Yee-FDTD) method in general orthogonal grids. We describe a partially implicit three-dimensional (3-D) FDTD formulation with directionally implicit time updating only for magnetic field and the conventional explicit time updating for electric field. The time discrete electric and magnetic field quantities are updated in a slightly modified leapfrog manner. Interestingly, the resulting 3-D scheme can be reduced to the conventional Yee-FDTD scheme when the Newmark parameter is chosen as zero. Its stability condition is more relaxed than the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition of the Yee-FDTD, and the spatial mesh size in a specific direction on general orthogonal grids can be eliminated. This feature allows us to efficiently analyze electromagnetic field problems with fine structures in one spatial direction on general orthogonal grids. In order to validate the presented formulation, its applications to 3-D simulations of canonical cavity resonator problems with cylindrical and spherical grids are demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07182278.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2466100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2466100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D MNL-FDTD Formulation in General Orthogonal Grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cavity resonators","Power system stability","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Stability analysis","Numerical stability","Magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic fields","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Newmark-Beta formulation","explicit leapfrog scheme","Yee's finite-difference time-domain method","Yee-FDTD method","general orthogonal grids","partially implicit three-dimensional FDTD formulation","partially implicit 3D FDTD formulation","directionally implicit time updating","explicit time updating","electric field","Newmark parameter","spatial mesh size","electromagnetic field problems","canonical cavity resonator problems","cylindrical grids","spherical grids"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["General orthogonal grids","magnetically-mixed Newmark-leapfrog finite-difference time-domain (MNL-FDTD) method","Newmark-Beta method","relaxed stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"3-D MNL-FDTD Formulation in General Orthogonal Grids","volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/7182278/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15829904","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D MNL-FDTD Formulation in General Orthogonal Grids","sourcePdf":"lawp-fujita-2466100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076606S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7182278","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182285,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Cristina Caccami","affiliation":["University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7287836/7182285/cacca-2465891-small.gif","p":["Maria Cristina Caccami was born in Scicli (RG), Italy, in 1985.

Most of the RFID sensing devices that have been experienced till now are based on power metrics. The change in the environment is converted into a variation of the antenna performance remotely sensed by a reader through a modulation of turn- on or backscattered power. This paper investigates a new sensing paradigm derived from the measurement of the phase of the electromagnetic signals that are backscattered from the tag in the UHF-RFID band. The main goal is to introduce a model of the phase response of antennas that are loaded by lumped sensitive materials (SMs). General properties, data-processing issues, the achievable dynamic ranges, sensitivities, and the measurement reproducibility of phase-oriented sensing are investigated by means of both numerical analysis and experimentations concerning an RFID humidity sensor as case study.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Radiofrequency identification","Humidity","Phase measurement","Loaded antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humidity sensors","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase oriented sensing","loaded UHF RFID tags","radio frequency identification tags","antenna performance","sensing paradigm","electromagnetic signal phase measurement","UHF-RFID band","antenna phase response","lumped sensitive materials","RFID humidity sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID","sensor","phase","humidity"]},{"kwd":["Humidity","radio frequency identification (RFID)","sensor","phase"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2465891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7287836/07182285.pdf","startPage":"4512","endPage":"4520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2465891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Oriented Sensing by Means of Loaded UHF RFID Tags","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Oriented Sensing by Means of Loaded UHF RFID Tags","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182285/","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182285/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15489038","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Oriented Sensing by Means of Loaded UHF RFID Tags","sourcePdf":"tap-manzari-2465891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070905S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7287836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7287836","articleId":"7182285","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7182288,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Zhu","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/7401194/7182288/zhu-small.gif","p":["Lin Zhu received the PhD degree in pattern recognition and\n intelligent system from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2013.

Instead of investigating them independently, several recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that a wealth of scientific insights can be gained by integrative analysis of these ChIP-seq data. However, when used for the purpose of integrative analysis, a serious drawback of current ChIP-seq technique is that it is still expensive and time-consuming to generate ChIP-seq datasets of high standard. Most researchers are therefore unable to obtain complete ChIP-seq data for several TFs in a wide variety of cell lines, which considerably limits the understanding of transcriptional regulation pattern. In this paper, we propose a novel method called ChIP-PIT to overcome the aforementioned limitation. In ChIP-PIT, ChIP-seq data corresponding to a diverse collection of cell types, TFs and genes are fused together using the three-mode pair-wise interaction tensor (PIT) model, and the prediction of unperformed ChIP-seq experimental results is formulated as a tensor completion problem. Computationally, we propose efficient first-order method based on extensions of coordinate descent method to learn the optimal solution of ChIP-PIT, which makes it particularly suitable for the analysis of massive scale ChIP-seq data. Experimental evaluation the ENCODE data illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2015.2465893","startPage":"55","endPage":"63","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM

microwave imaging system. The system uses time-domain measurements, and incorporates a multistatic radar approach to imaging. It operates in the 2-4 GHz range and contains 16 wideband sensors embedded in a hemispherical dielectric radome. The system has been previously tested on tissue phantoms in controlled experiments. With this system prototype, we scanned 13 patients (26 breasts) over an eight-month period, collecting a total of 342 breast scans. The goal of the study described in this paper was to investigate how the system measurements are impacted by multiple factors that are unavoidable in monthly monitoring of human subjects. These factors include both biological variability (e.g., tissue variations due to hormonal changes or weight gain) and measurement variability (e.g., inconsistencies in patient positioning, system noise). For each patient breast, we process the results of the monthly scans to assess the variability in both the raw measured signals and in the generated images. The significance of this study is that it quantifies how much variability should be anticipated when conducting microwave breast imaging of a healthy patient over a longer period. This is an important step toward establishing the feasibility of the microwave radar imaging system for frequent monitoring of breast health.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2465867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7412788/07182293.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2465867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7412788","startPage":"530","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Early Clinical Study of Time-Domain Microwave Radar for Breast Health Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Early Clinical Study of Time-Domain Microwave Radar for Breast Health Monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182293/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15819326","pubMedId":"26259214","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7182293/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Le Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Nature et technologies"},{"fundingName":"Partenariat de recherche orient\u00e9e en micro\u00e9lectronique"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Early Clinical Study of Time-Domain Microwave Radar for Breast Health Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tbme-porter-2465867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102458S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7412788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"7412788","articleId":"7182293","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7182305,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7182305/tong-2465903_print-small.gif","p":["\nZhen Tong (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree in automation from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

Full-duplex (FD) radios can exchange data simultaneously with each other. On the other hand, the downside of FD transmission is that it will inevitably cause extra interference to the network compared to half-duplex (HD) transmission. Moreover, the residual self-interference has negative effects on the network throughput. In this paper, we focus on a wireless network of nodes with both HD and FD capabilities and derive and optimize the throughput in such a network. Our analytical result shows that if the network is adopting an ALOHA protocol, the maximal throughput is achieved by scheduling all concurrently transmitting nodes to work in either FD mode or HD mode depending on one simple condition. Moreover, the effects of imperfect self-interference cancellation on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) loss and throughput are also analyzed based on our mathematical model. We rigorously quantify the impact of imperfect self-interference cancellation on the throughput gain, transmission range, and other metrics, and we establish the minimum amount of self-interference suppression needed for FD to be beneficial.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"63","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15676743","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182305/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Analysis for Full-Duplex Wireless Networks With Imperfect Self-Interference Cancellation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1231806 and CCF 1216407"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Analysis for Full-Duplex Wireless Networks With Imperfect Self-Interference Cancellation","sourcePdf":"tcomm-tong-2465903-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191776S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7182305","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7182306,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7182306/tong-2465958_print-small.gif","p":["\nZhen Tong received the B.Eng. degree in automation from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

RODD is based on the insight that it is not necessary to separate a node's transmission and reception at the timescale of a frame. Instead, RODD allows each node in a network to follow a different random on-off signaling signature to transmit during its own on-slots and listen to its neighbors through its own off-slots. Over one frame interval, each node broadcasts its message to its neighbors while recovering its neighbors' messages from the superposed signals received via its own off-slots. In this paper, we describe an RODD prototype to prove its key concepts, including redesigned synchronization and coding schemes. Simulation results are presented for comparison with the measurements obtained from a software-defined radio implementation of RODD. The effects of on-off signaling on the performance are investigated experimentally. In particular, the bit error rate is measured and compared with the simulation results.

The impact of frequency domain correlation amongst the OFDM sub-bands allocated to the FR1 and FR3 cell-regions is analysed and it is shown that the presence of correlation reduces both the coverage probability and the average throughput of the FFR network. Furthermore, the performance of our FFR-aided MU-MIMO and SIMO systems is compared. Our analysis shows that the (2 \u00d7 2) MU-MIMO system achieves 22.5% higher rate than the (1 \u00d7 3) SIMO system and for lower target SINRs, the coverage probability of a (2 \u00d7 2) MU-MIMO system is comparable to a (1 \u00d7 3) SIMO system. Hence the former one may be preferred over the latter. Our simulation results closely match the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2465907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07182316.pdf","startPage":"3869","endPage":"3881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2465907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage Probability and Achievable Rate Analysis of FFR-Aided Multi-User OFDM-Based MIMO and SIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182316/","displayDocTitle":"Coverage Probability and Achievable Rate Analysis of FFR-Aided Multi-User OFDM-Based MIMO and SIMO Systems","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524634","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182316/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DST India under the IU-ATC project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage Probability and Achievable Rate Analysis of FFR-Aided Multi-User OFDM-Based MIMO and SIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-2465907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107718S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7182316","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182323,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7287875/7182323/xu-2456972-small.gif","p":["Bin Xu received the B.S. degree in measurement and control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beiijng, China, in 2012.","He visited ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, from 2010 to 2011.

A new switching mechanism is designed to combine an adaptive neural controller in the neural approximation domain, together with the robust controller that pulls the transient states back into the neural approximation domain from the outside. In comparison with the conventional control techniques, which could only achieve semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded stability, the proposed control scheme guarantees all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded, such that the conventional constraints on initial conditions of the neural control system can be relaxed.

This paper addresses regulation challenges for high-power SC converters, based on charge-balance transient-calculation (CT) modeling method and peak current stress estimation. With the help of CT model, due to its accuracy and comprehensive relationship, circuit and control parameters' impacts on regulation become straightforward and concerns on components stresses can be addressed quantitatively. The suitability of CT method for regulation analysis is confirmed by comparison with traditional modeling methods. The CT method is used in a 1-kW 3X two-switch boosting switched-capacitor converter (TBSC) circuit for steady-state analysis and current stress estimation. The soft rising input current and nature interleaving properties of 3X TBSC make it well suited for high-power application. Finally, the small-signal model of the 3X TBSC is developed and a closed-loop operation is achieved under 1 kW power rating.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15677469","htmlLink":"/document/7182330/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of High-Power Switched-Capacitor Converter Regulation Based on Charge-Balance Transient-Calculation Method","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BSF","grantNumber":"2011507"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of High-Power Switched-Capacitor Converter Regulation Based on Charge-Balance Transient-Calculation Method","sourcePdf":"tpel-wu-2466095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088759S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7182330","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182334,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfeng Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Municipal Key Lab of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology, College of Metropolitan Transportation, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7398218/7182334/sun-small.gif","p":["Yanfeng Sun received the PhD degree from the Dalian University of\n Technology, P.R.

Often in dealing with those datasets, standard practice is to use subspace clustering that is based on vectorizing multiarray data. However, vectorization of tensorial data does not exploit complete structure information. In this paper, we propose a subspace clustering algorithm without adopting any vectorization process. Our approach is based on a novel heterogeneous Tucker decomposition model taking into account cluster membership information. We propose a new clustering algorithm that alternates between different modes of the proposed heterogeneous tensor model. All but the last mode have closed-form updates. Updating the last mode reduces to optimizing over the multinomial manifold for which we investigate second order Riemannian geometry and propose a trust-region algorithm. Numerical experiments show that our proposed algorithm compete effectively with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms that are based on tensor factorization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7398218/07182334.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2465901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2465901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Tensor Decomposition for Clustering via Manifold Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Manifolds","Optimization","Clustering algorithms","Measurement","Matrix decomposition","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern clustering","tensors","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous tensor decomposition","manifold optimization","tensor clustering","subspace clustering","multiarray data vectorization","subspace clustering algorithm","heterogeneous Tucker decomposition model","membership information clustering","second order Riemannian geometry","trust-region algorithm","tensor factorization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor clustering","multinomial manifold","Fisher metric","Riemannian optimization","trust-region"]},{"kwd":["Tensor clustering","multinomial manifold","Fisher metric","Riemannian optimization","trust-region"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Tensor Decomposition for Clustering via Manifold Optimization","volume":"38","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7182334/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15755136","pubMedId":"27046492","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP130100364"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370119, 61133003 and 61390510"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing","grantNumber":"4132013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Tensor Decomposition for Clustering via Manifold Optimization","sourcePdf":"tpami-gao-2465901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267903S","chronDate":"March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7398218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7398218","articleId":"7182334","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7182342,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Liu","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7182342/liu-small.gif","p":["Jia Liu (S\u201915) was born in Xuzhou, China, in 1986.

As a result, novel control methods like droop control and virtual synchronous generator (VSG) have been proposed. In both methods, droop characteristics are used to control active and reactive power, and the only difference between them is that VSG has virtual inertia with the emulation of swing equation, whereas droop control has no inertia. In this paper, dynamic characteristics of both control methods are studied, in both stand-alone mode and synchronous-generator-connected mode, to understand the differences caused by swing equation. Small-signal models are built to compare transient responses of frequency during a small loading transition, and state-space models are built to analyze oscillation of output active power. Effects of delays in both controls are also studied, and an inertial droop control method is proposed based on the comparison. The results are verified by simulations and experiments. It is suggested that VSG control and proposed inertial droop control inherits the advantages of droop control, and in addition, provides inertia support for the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","volume":"31","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15677480","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7182342/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Dynamic Characteristics Between Virtual Synchronous Generator and Droop Control in Inverter-Based Distributed Generators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Dynamic Characteristics Between Virtual Synchronous Generator and Droop Control in Inverter-Based Distributed Generators","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2465852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108904S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"480","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7182342","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7182344,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Narayanan","affiliation":["WEST Aquila s.r.l., Italy","School of Electrical, Electronic, and Communications Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6884276/7229412/7182344/naray-2466081-small.gif","p":["Sandeep Narayanan (S\u201908) received the B.Tech. degree from Amrita University, Coimbatore, India, in 2010, the M.Sc. degree from the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and information engineering from the University of L\u2019Aquila, L\u2019Aquila, Italy, in 2015.

The recently proposed singleRF space shift keying (SSK-) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmission scheme is one of such physical layer technology that satisfies these criteria. In general, SSK requires a large number of antenna elements (with only one of them active) at the transmitter for high data rate transmission. This makes SSK particularly useful for the downlink of cellular systems. In this paper, we exploit the virtual MIMO concept to design SSK transmission schemes for the uplink of cellular networks. The idea is to take advantage of nearby nodes to the mobile terminal as a \u201cvirtual spatial-constellation diagram,\u201d where the information can be encoded and transmitted to the final destination. By taking into account the virtual nature of the spatial-constellation diagram, we develop advanced demodulation techniques, perform a comprehensive mathematical analysis, as well as analyze the system complexity and energy consumption. It is also shown that the proposed scheme is capable of outperforming certain state-of-the-art protocols.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6884276/7229412/07182344.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","doi":"10.1109/TSIPN.2015.2466081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSIPN.2015.2466081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Achievable Performance-Complexity Tradeoffs of Relay-Aided Space Shift Keying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Demodulation","Decision support systems","Protocols","MIMO","Information processing","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","demodulation","MIMO communication","modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance-complexity tradeoff","relay-aided space shift keying","cellular network uplink","mobile data traffic","single-RF space shift keying","SSK","multiple-input-multiple-output transmission scheme","MIMO transmission scheme","physical layer technology","antenna element","cellular system downlink","virtual spatial-constellation diagram","demodulation technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space Shift Keying","Multiple\u2013Input-Multiple- Output","Relaying"]},{"kwd":["Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)","relaying","space shift keying (SSK)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Achievable Performance-Complexity Tradeoffs of Relay-Aided Space Shift Keying","volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7182344/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417270","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"FP7-PEOPLE ITN-GREENET","grantNumber":"264759"},{"fundingName":"FP7-PEOPLE MITN-CROSSFIRE","grantNumber":"317126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Achievable Performance-Complexity Tradeoffs of Relay-Aided Space Shift Keying","sourcePdf":"tsipn-narayanan-2466081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138597S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"7229412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7229412","articleId":"7182344","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182346,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Shi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7425337/7182346/shi-small.gif","p":["Jianping Shi received the BS degree in computer science and\n engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2011.

When an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns either in the background or foreground, saliency detection could be adversely affected, resulting erroneous and non-uniform saliency assignment. The issue forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, we measure region-based scales. The final saliency values are inferred optimally combining all the saliency cues in different scales using hierarchical inference. Through our inference model, single-scale information is selected to obtain a saliency map. Our method improves detection quality on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. We also construct an extended Complex Scene Saliency Dataset (ECSSD) to include complex but general natural images.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2465960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7425337/07182346.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2465960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7425337","startPage":"717","endPage":"729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Image Saliency Detection on Extended CSSD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Image Saliency Detection on Extended CSSD","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"1 April 2016","accessionNumber":"15823538","pubMedId":"26959676","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7182346/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"413110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Image Saliency Detection on Extended CSSD","sourcePdf":"tpami-jia-2465960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103721S","chronDate":"April 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7425337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"7425337","articleId":"7182346","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7182347,"authors":[{"name":"Junzhi Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junzhi","lastName":"Yu","orcid":"0000-0002-6347-572X","id":"37278401500"},{"name":"Zhengxing Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengxing","lastName":"Wu","id":"38580572600"},{"name":"Ming Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539558000"},{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274596200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"7182347","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Oscillators","Mathematical model","Robot sensing systems","Robot kinematics","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","evolutionary computation","marine control","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","particle swarm optimisation","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["central pattern generator","CPG network optimization","parameter optimization","forward swimming speed","backward swimming speed","fully untethered robotic fish","multijoint biomimetic robotic fish","propulsive performance","evolutionary computation","dynamic model","particle swarm optimization","PSO algorithm","dedicated neural nets","biological fish-inspired"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Central pattern generator (CPG)","neurodynamic systems","parameter optimization","robotic fish"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Biomimetics","Computer Simulation","Fishes","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2459913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2459913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7543555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7543555/07182347.pdf","startPage":"1962","endPage":"1968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CPG Network Optimization for a Biomimetic Robotic Fish via PSO","abstract":"In this brief, we investigate the parameter optimization issue of a central pattern generator (CPG) network governed forward and backward swimming for a fully untethered, multijoint biomimetic robotic fish.

In order to obtain a robust metric for matching, metric learning has been introduced recently. Most existing works focus on seeking a Mahalanobis distance by employing sparse pairwise constraints, which utilize image pairs with the same person identity as positive samples, and select a small portion of those with different identities as negative samples. However, this training strategy has abandoned a large amount of discriminative information, and ignored the relative similarities. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance metric learning method with listwise constraints (RMLLCs) by adopting listwise similarities, which consist of the similarity list of each image with respect to all remaining images. By virtue of listwise similarities, RMLLC could capture all pairwise similarities, and consequently learn a more discriminative metric by enforcing the metric to conserve predefined similarity lists in a low-dimensional projection subspace. Despite the performance enhancement, RMLLC using predefined similarity lists fails to capture the relative relevance information, which is often unavailable in practice. To address this problem, we further introduce a rectification term to automatically exploit the relative similarities, and develop an efficient alternating iterative algorithm to jointly learn the optimal metric and the rectification term. Extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking data sets are carried out and demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches. The results also show that the introduction of the rectification term could further boost the performance of RMLLC.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07182350.pdf","startPage":"4741","endPage":"4755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2466117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2466117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relevance Metric Learning for Person Re-Identification by Exploiting Listwise Similarities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Learning systems","Probes","Training","Cameras","Lighting","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relevance metric learning","person re-identification","listwise similarities","video surveillance","sparse pairwise constraints","RMLLC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Person re-identification","metric learning","list-wise similarities"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometric Identification","Humans","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Video Recording"]},{"kwd":["Person re-identification","metric learning","list-wise similarities","alternating iterative optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Relevance Metric Learning for Person Re-Identification by Exploiting Listwise Similarities","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7182350/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15457323","pubMedId":"26259221","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"L2015TGA9004"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups through the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61421003 and 61375036"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4132064"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relevance Metric Learning for Person Re-Identification by Exploiting Listwise Similarities","sourcePdf":"tip-zhang-2466117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119407S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7182350","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182356,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Hosang","affiliation":["D2, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Saarland, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7425337/7182356/hosan-small.gif","p":["Jan Hosang received the diploma in computer science from the RWTH\n Aachen University in 2011.

Despite the popularity and widespread use of detection proposals, it is unclear which trade-offs are made when using them during object detection. We provide an in-depth analysis of twelve proposal methods along with four baselines regarding proposal repeatability, ground truth annotation recall on PASCAL, ImageNet, and MS COCO, and their impact on DPM, R-CNN, and Fast R-CNN detection performance. Our analysis shows that for object detection improving proposal localisation accuracy is as important as improving recall. We introduce a novel metric, the average recall (AR), which rewards both high recall and good localisation and correlates surprisingly well with detection performance. Our findings show common strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and provide insights and metrics for selecting and tuning proposal methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2465908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7425337/07182356.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7425337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2465908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Makes for Effective Detection Proposals?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"What Makes for Effective Detection Proposals?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182356/","publicationDate":"1 April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15823535","pubMedId":"26959679","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182356/","volume":"38","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Makes for Effective Detection Proposals?","sourcePdf":"tpami-hosang-2465908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138767S","chronDate":"April 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7425337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"343","xplore-issue":"7425337","articleId":"7182356","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7182359,"authors":[{"name":"Thinh Hung Pham","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7182359/pham-2453207-small.gif","p":["Thinh Hung Pham (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in embedded systems engineering from the University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K., in 2010.

The IFO can be mitigated through strict RF front-end design, which tends to be expensive, or by strictly limiting mobility and channel agility, which constrains operating scenarios. The IFO is, therefore, often estimated and removed at baseband, allowing implementations to benefit from the relaxed RF front-end specifications and to be tolerant to both Doppler shift and multistandard channel selection. This paper proposes a novel architecture for the IFO estimation which achieves reduced power consumption and lower computational cost than contemporary methods, while achieving excellent estimation performance, close to theoretically achievable bounds. A pilot subsampling technique enables fourfold resource sharing to reduce the computational cost, while multiplierless computation yields further power reduction. Performance exceeds that of the conventional techniques, while being much more efficient. When implemented on field-programmable gate array for IEEE 802.16-2009, the dynamic power reductions of 78% are achieved. The architecture and method is applicable to other OFDM standards including IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.22.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2453207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7436835/07182359.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2453207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7436835","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Integer Frequency Offset Estimation Architecture for Enhanced OFDM Synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Integer Frequency Offset Estimation Architecture for Enhanced OFDM Synchronization","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15874315","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7182359/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Integer Frequency Offset Estimation Architecture for Enhanced OFDM Synchronization","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pham-2453207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06253S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7436835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7436835","articleId":"7182359","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182360,"authors":[{"name":"Vittorio Tornielli di Crestvolant","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical, and Systems Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287853/7182360/7182360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vittorio Tornielli di Crestvolant (GSM\u201914) was born in Reggio Emilia, Italy, in 1986.

Bit corruptions can be caused by single event upsets (SEUs) in the storage cells or by sampling single event transients (SETs) from a logic path. An accurate prediction of soft error susceptibility from SETs requires good models to convert collected charge into compact descriptions of the current injection process. This paper describes a simple, yet effective, method to model the current waveform resulting from a charge collection event for SET circuit simulations. The model uses two double-exponential current sources in parallel, and the results illustrate why a conventional model based on one double-exponential source can be incomplete. A small set of logic cells with varying input conditions, drive strength, and output loading are simulated to extract the parameters for the dual double-exponential current sources. The parameters are based upon both the node capacitance and the restoring current (i.e., drive strength) of the logic cell.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2449073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

semiconductor devices continues to be important, even with the adoption of FinFET devices which overcome some important limitations of planar MOSFETs. The study in this paper presents both theoretical and experimental results via advanced simulation techniques, to investigate the difference between planar and FinFET devices in terms of SER. Neutron test results from different facilities are presented, and the observed differences in sensitivity are explained through theoretical analysis. In the second half of the paper, the test results are validated through TCAD and TFIT simulations using a calibrated technology response model. The analysis shows that the reduction in sensitivity of FinFET devices is primarily due to an increase in the threshold LET and a reduction in the sensitive volume due the shape of the transistor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182365/","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7182365/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15365063","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Study of Neutron Soft Error Rate (SER) Sensitivity: Investigation of Upset Mechanisms by Comparative Simulation of FinFET and Planar MOSFET SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Neutron Soft Error Rate (SER) Sensitivity: Investigation of Upset Mechanisms by Comparative Simulation of FinFET and Planar MOSFET SRAMs","sourcePdf":"tns-correas-2450997-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115787S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7203194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7203194","articleId":"7182365","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182370,"authors":[{"name":"Heather Quinn","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Heather","lastName":"Quinn","id":"37409112900"},{"name":"Michael Wirthlin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wirthlin","id":"37283898600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"7182370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1413},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182370","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Emulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Testing","Hardware","Software","Pins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit testing","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static random access memory","SRAM","field-programmable gate arrays","FPGA","fault emulation systems","single-event effects","SEE","radiation-hardness assurance","RHA methodologies","failure rate estimation","radiation effects researchers","radiation environment","radiation-induced faults"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emulation","fault diagnosis","field programmable gate arrays","radiation effects"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2456101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7203194/07182370.pdf","startPage":"1487","endPage":"1500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2456101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation Techniques for Fault Emulation of SRAM-based FPGAs","abstract":"A variety of fault emulation systems have been created to study the effect of single-event effects (SEEs) in static random access memory (SRAM) based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

If the fault emulation systems does not mimic the radiation environment, the system will generate erroneous data and incorrect predictions of behavior of the FPGA in a radiation environment.

In the presence of an eavesdropper, we derive an optimal power allocation strategy to maximize achievable secrecy rates under an overall transmit power constraint assuming that a single relay is located at each individual hop. We demonstrate that the optimal power allocation is obtained when the overall power constraint and the DF-relaying constraints necessary to guarantee that each DF relay correctly decodes the information signals hold with equality, which rely on channel conditions between the source, relays, and destination. The channel conditions for the eavesdropper are shown to only influence relays that may be inactive for secrecy rate maximization. We also consider multiple cooperative relays at each hop to perform cooperative beamforming in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. To improve the secrecy rate in multi-hop relay networks, which include more than two hops, we propose an iterative cooperative beamformer design and transmit power allocation scheme with relay selection. Numerical results are presented to investigate the secrecy capacity obtained by the optimal power allocation in multi-hop DF relay networks and to confirm the secrecy rate enhancement of the proposed cooperative beamforming scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15697432","htmlLink":"/document/7182372/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Physical Layer Security in Multi-Hop DF Relay Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A1A1A05004401"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation for Physical Layer Security in Multi-Hop DF Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-lee-2466091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123051S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7182372","onlineDate":"07 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7182378,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The results also point out that changing polarizations at User Equipment (UE) does not give any significant MAC TP and MIMO Utilization improvements.","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182491","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182491.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","startPage":"35","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposal antenna polarization diversity for LTE 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO in indoor testbed","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A proposal antenna polarization diversity for LTE 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO in indoor testbed","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182491/","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363685","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182491/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposal antenna polarization diversity for LTE 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO in indoor testbed","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052252S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182493,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Anamalamudi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Satish","lastName":"Anamalamudi","id":"38246572800"},{"name":"Minglu Jin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Minglu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37292061200"},{"name":"Jae Moung Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Moung Kim","id":"37293480200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182493","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Protocols","Multiaccess communication","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","directive antennas","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid CCC based AODV routing protocol","cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","directional antennas","end-to-end application throughput","node energy consumption","common control channel characteristics","CCC characteristics","energy efficient shortest end-to-end channel-path","route control overhead","out-of-band overlay spectrum bands","omni-directional control","directional data transmission","end-to-end channel-route power consumption","spectrum handover packet drops"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Directional antenna","CR-AODV","energy efficient","common control channel\u2025"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182493","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182493.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid CCC based AODV routing protocol for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks with directional antennas","abstract":"End-to-end application throughput and node energy consumption at cognitive network layer is based on channel-route selected from cognitive routing algorithm with common control channel (CCC) characteristics. Hence, CCC based CR-AODV is utmost important to select energy efficient shortest end-to-end channel-path and reduce route control overhead. State-of-the-art routing protocols design CCC with In or Out-of-band overlay spectrum bands. Per hop and group coverage with In-band CCC is subject to higher end-to-end channel switching delays and multi-channel hidden terminal. On the other hand, global coverage with out-of-band CCC leads to channel saturation and intruder attacks that result in a single point of network failure. To overcome this, we propose a hybrid CCC design for AODV routing protocol with Omni-directional control and directional data transmission that reduce end-to-end channel-route power consumption, avoid multi-channel hidden terminal and minimize spectrum handover packet drops. Experimental results reveal that proposed routing with directional data transmission has increased throughput, reduced power consumption and less control overhead when compared with existing In/Out-of-band Omni-directional based CR-routing protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182493/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15363521","publicationDate":"July 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182493/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid CCC based AODV routing protocol for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks with directional antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid CCC based AODV routing protocol for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks with directional antennas","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07609S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182500,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Liao","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yun Liao","id":"37085375709"},{"name":"Kaigui Bian","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Kaigui Bian","id":"37296444800"},{"name":"Lili Ma","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lili Ma","id":"37085554428"},{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lingyang Song","id":"37085557804"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182500","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Sensors","Robustness","Cascading style sheets","Transmitting antennas","Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","interference suppression","protocols","radio spectrum management","sensor fusion","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust cooperative spectrum sensing","full duplex cognitive radio networks","secondary users","sensing impairment","self-interference","FD protocol","sensing reliability improvement","FD CRNs","CSS scheme","confidence-only report rule","weighted majority fusion rule","listen and talk protocol","LAt protocol"]}],"abstract":"Recently, a \u201clisten-and-talk\u201d (LAT) protocol for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio networks (CRNs) has been proposed to allow simultaneous sensing and transmission of secondary users (SUs).

In femto/macrocell networks, a location management should be supported to keep track of the current location of a mobile node (MN). Since the conventional mobility management scheme of femto/macrocell networks does not consider mobility pattern of the MN, unnecessary location updates occur. Specifically, when the MN moves along the contour of the femtocell coverage, the MN frequently executes location update which causes high location update cost. To address this problem, we propose a mobility-aware location management (MALM) scheme that the MN does not execute location update in femtocells where the MN stops by while conducting location update at the specific locations expected that the MN stays for a long time. Then, to optimize MALM, a Markov decision process (MDP) problem is formulated and the optimal policy is determined. Evaluation results demonstrate that MALM with the optimal policy can reduce the number of location updates and provide sufficient offloading effect.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182532.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobility-aware location management scheme in femto/macrocell networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Markov processes","mobile computing","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility-aware location management scheme","MALM scheme","femtocell networks","macrocell networks","mobility management scheme","Markov decision process","MDP problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Location management","mobility management","femtocell","Markov decision process (MDP)","offloading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mobility-aware location management scheme in femto/macrocell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363686","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility-aware location management scheme in femto/macrocell networks","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"3B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053988S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182534,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Wei Tsai","affiliation":["National I-Lan University, Yilan, TW"],"firstName":"Chun-Wei","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37557169900"},{"name":"Shi-Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan R.O.C."],"firstName":"Shi-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085515163"},{"name":"Kai-Cheng Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan R.O.C."],"firstName":"Kai-Cheng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37893647700"},{"name":"Ming-Chao Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan R.O.C."],"firstName":"Ming-Chao","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37591905200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182534","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Wireless LAN","Sociology","Statistics","Convergence","Load management","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Internet","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified multiple-search multistart framework-enhanced micro genetic algorithm","WLAN load balancing","IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks","Internet","access points","micro-GA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless local area network","genetic algorithm","load balance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182534","abstract":"The IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) is the popular method for the mobile devices to access the Internet today; however, it does not provide the mechanism to balance the load of access points (APs) so as to avoid the congestion problem, thus maximizing the performance of each client.

In addition, a detector is used to identify the existence of selfish behavior at the relay such that the reliability of the received data can be assessed. Having removed the unreliable data where necessary, a least square estimator is applied to determine the channel state information of the source-relay-destination cascaded link.

In this paper, we propose the parallel PTS (P-PTS)and serial PTS (S-PTS) methods to reduce the C-PTS complexity, based on the fact that the weighting factors are chosen as codewords of a linear block code.

A two-level feedback scheme is used to collect information of each cell. Two kinds of channel state information (CSI) are fed back to base station (BS) within one cell while BSs use a greedy algorithm to reduce the feedback to a centralized Channel Distributor. The traffic load and access ability of UEs are considered together in BS side in order to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS). Finally, a System Capacity (SC) and System Unsatisfactory Degree (SUD) tradeoff algorithm is proposed to allocate channels to cells. Simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme is able to increase the throughput and to meet the traffic load requirement of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182547","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","startPage":"263","endPage":"267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS guaranteed channel allocation algorithm in multi-cell OFDMA network with reduced feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A QoS guaranteed channel allocation algorithm in multi-cell OFDMA network with reduced feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182547/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363684","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182547/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS guaranteed channel allocation algorithm in multi-cell OFDMA network with reduced feedback","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"4A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048223S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182566,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-woo Kim","affiliation":["Communications & Internet Research Laboratory, ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-woo","lastName":"Kim","id":"38241169000"},{"name":"Hyeong-sook Park","affiliation":["Communications & Internet Research Laboratory, ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeong-sook","lastName":"Park","id":"37290676700"},{"name":"Young-jo Bang","affiliation":["Communications & Internet Research Laboratory, ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Korea"],"firstName":"Young-jo","lastName":"Bang","id":"37343593800"},{"name":"Ilgyu Kim","affiliation":["Communications & Internet Research Laboratory, ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Korea"],"lastName":"Ilgyu Kim","id":"37675181400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182566","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"abstract":"This paper describes the signal to noise ratio (SNR) estimation method for OFDM system.

In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), SUs execute cooperative spectrum sensing to find available spectrum channels and exchange those sensed channels-related control information, namely available channels list (ACL) information, on common control channel (CCC) before determining when and in which data channels they may communicate. However, some SUs, defined as attackers, could cause security issue on the CCC by sharing false ACL information with other SUs benefit for their own utilization of the available spectrum channels, which significantly decreases the performance of the CRNs. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection scheme to identify attackers by cooperated SUs for CCC security. In the proposed scheme, all SUs exchange and share their control information on CCC with a reputation cooperate to identify attackers. The reputation of each SU is updated according to its own historical and recent behavior. Simulation results show that how to further improve the performance of the proposed scheme by choosing optimized thresholds. In addition, we also illustrate the proposed scheme can achieve a considerable performance improvement compared with a selfish attack detection technique (COOPON) for secure ACL information exchange on CCC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15363630","htmlLink":"/document/7182616/","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A cooperative attack detection scheme for common control channel security in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cooperative attack detection scheme for common control channel security in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"8B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091496S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182623,"authors":[{"name":"Jaedeok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jaedeok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085590529"},{"name":"Ganguk Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Ganguk","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37276190400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182623","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Numerical stability","Sensors","Approximation methods","Simulation","Queueing analysis","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cognitive radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel cognitive radio networks","stability analysis","decoupling approach","secondary users","channel sensing","stability region","decoupling approximation","channel sensing errors","channel access policy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a multi-channel cognitive radio network with multiple secondary users where the channel sensing of a secondary user is imperfect.

The tag identification is performed considering the influence of both code collisions and detection errors due to fading channels. The system efficiency, which is defined as the average number of successfully detected tags over a slot, is theoretically derived. Computer simulations are also performed to validate the theoretical analysis. In the numerical results, we evaluate the performance of the tag identification procedure with system parameters that maximize the system efficiency.

To set up cluster-based CR ad-hoc common channels, conventional methods require relatively long time to successfully exchange the initialization messages. In this paper, we propose a fast and reliable common channel initialization protocol for CR ad-hoc networks. In the proposed method, cluster head sequentially broadcasts a system activation signal through its available channels with a predetermined correlation pattern. To detect the cluster head's broadcasting channels and to join the cluster, each member node takes FFT and computes autocorrelation of FFT bin sequence for each available channel of the member node. The join request and channel decision procedure are also presented in this paper. In the simulation study, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182644","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182644.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182644","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","startPage":"754","endPage":"759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common channel initialization protocol in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Common channel initialization protocol in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182644/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182644/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363597","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common channel initialization protocol in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"10B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070056S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182649,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Yuan Chang","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yao-Yuan Chang","id":"37085512020"},{"name":"Wan-Jen Huang","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wan-Jen Huang","id":"37399170600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182649","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Presses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","energy conservation","energy harvesting","optimisation","precoding","statistical analysis","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive beamforming design","wireless information transfer","coordinated multipoint system","statistical CSI","CoMP transmission system","user equipment","UE","energy harvesting","EH","information detection mode","ID mode","statistical channel knowledge","energy efficiency enhancement","joint precoding design","operation mode assignment","probability","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coordinated multi-point transmission","wireless energy transfer","precoding design","partial CSI"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive beamforming design for wireless information transfer in coordinated multi-point systems with statistical CSI","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","endPage":"786","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182649.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182649","startPage":"784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182649","abstract":"In this work, we consider a coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission system where each user equipments (UEs) may operate in energy harvesting (EH) or information detection (ID) mode.

The multi-hop connectivity of cognitive radio ad-hoc networks under each forwarding scheme is examined and compared to each other. Simulation results in this paper show that full flooding only outperforms other schemes under certain circumstances of secondary user's density and operating frequency. However, it is a well-known fact that full flooding results in more network resource usage than limited flooding. Therefore, this paper provides an efficient guidance for system designers to characterize and optimize the multi-hop connectivity of CRAHNs under certain packet forwarding schemes of routing protocols so that maximum connectivity can be achieved with lowest network resource usage.","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182653","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182653.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182653","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","startPage":"805","endPage":"807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How do forwarding schemes influence the multi-hop connectivity in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"How do forwarding schemes influence the multi-hop connectivity in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182653/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182653/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363556","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How do forwarding schemes influence the multi-hop connectivity in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks?","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"10C4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07779S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182655,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyong Cheon","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea"],"lastName":"Jinyong Cheon","id":"38068619500"},{"name":"Ho-Shin Cho","affiliation":["College of IT Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea"],"lastName":"Ho-Shin Cho","id":"37276159200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182655","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"In this paper, a heuristic resource allocation method for underwater uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system is proposed to reduce computational complexity.

Simulation results validate our theoretical results under three distinct cases as follows: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the main link between a secondary transmitter and a corresponding receiver is, respectively, smaller, equal to, or larger than the SNR of the eavesdropper link between the same secondary transmitter and the eavesdropper.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2015.7182678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182475","startPage":"914","endPage":"918","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172793/7182475/07182678.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure transmission using decode-and-forward protocol for underlay cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182678/","displayDocTitle":"Secure transmission using decode-and-forward protocol for underlay cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363530","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure transmission using decode-and-forward protocol for underlay cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"12A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053816S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182680,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Huy Lam","affiliation":["Dept. of Ubiquitous IT, Dongseo University, Busan, Korea"],"lastName":"Jun-Huy Lam","id":"37088050445"},{"name":"Sang-Gon Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Ubiquitous IT, Dongseo University, Busan, Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Gon Lee","id":"37087825477"},{"name":"Hoon-Jae Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Ubiquitous IT, Dongseo University, Busan, Korea"],"lastName":"Hoon-Jae Lee","id":"37087183611"},{"name":"Yustus Eko Oktian","affiliation":["Dept. of Ubiquitous IT, Dongseo University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Yustus Eko","lastName":"Oktian","id":"37085360052"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8993-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"7182680","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":630},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182680","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Security","Protocols","Computers","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","cryptographic protocols","software defined networking","telecommunication channels","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed SDN communication channel security","distributed software defined network","multidomain capable identity-based cryptography protocol","IBC protocol","TLS","transport layer security","OpenFlow","southbound protocol","east-west-bound protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Southbound security","east/west-bound security","SDN security","Distributed SDN security","ID-based Cryptography","IBC","TLS alternative"]}],"abstract":"In distributed software-defined network (SDN), the east/west-bound protocol describes the communication between the SDN controllers. The security of the east/west-bound protocol ensures that no malicious controllers are eavesdropping on or even driving the network. Southbound protocol defines the communication between the control plane and the data plane. It is also the only SDN communication channel with an agreed protocol, OpenFlow. OpenFlow suggests securing the southbound communication with Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, most current SDN projects do not implement the security segment in both the east/west-bound and southbound communications.

This paper proposes a novel framework, which provides highly accurate synchronization between the gyroscope and the camera module. The gyroscope in our framework provides a high sampling rate of 8KHz to make it possible to record the camera motion highly accurately as well. We designed synchronization hardware block, and put that block in front end chip to operate with application processor of smart phone. Synchronization hardware block is around 200,000 gates.

To decrease the operational cost of networks, engineers have tuned to self-organizing networks (SON) that facilitate automatic operation of a network. Challenges have emerged, however, that hinder the current SON paradigm from meeting the requirements of 5G. To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed a framework for empowering SON with big data. The framework of big data empowered SON analyzes the relationship between key performance indicators (KPIs) and related network parameters (NPs) using machine learning tools; with those parameters, the framework develops regression models using Gaussian process. These models are then applied to the SON engine to be further optimized for operation. The problem, however, is that the methods of finding NPs related to KPI differ case by case. In addition, it is not easy to apprehend the relationship between a KPI and the various NPs related to that KPI with the Gaussian process regression model because it is a single regression. In this paper, to alleviate these two problems, we propose multiple regression models based on MapReduce, where a KPI is the dependent variable and NPs are the independent variables; then we also describe implementation issues with MapReduce.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182693/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363676","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiple regression models for a big data empowered SON framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple regression models for a big data empowered SON framework","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"12D4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062548S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172793","isNumber":"7182475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7182475","articleId":"7182693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7182733,"authors":[{"name":"Atsushi Aratake","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Atsushi Aratake was born in Miyazaki, Japan, in 1972.

LDM can potentially offer fundamental performance gains as compared to traditional time-division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency-division multiplexing due to the reuse by all information layers of all the available time-frequency resources. The main use case of LDM for terrestrial broadcasting is the simultaneous provision of fixed and mobile services in the same channel. Since most DTT networks worldwide are dimensioned for fixed rooftop reception, this paper illustrates the performance comparison between LDM and F/TDM in terms of the capacity-coverage tradeoff of the mobile service for a given reduction of the capacity of the fixed service while keeping the coverage of the fixed service constant. A mathematical formulation, and corresponding numerical results, are provided for different fading channels, including single-input single-output, single-input multiple-output, multiple-input single-output, and multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems, and accounting also for the impact of non-ideal channel coding.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7337347/07182743.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2459665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2459665","startPage":"571","endPage":"579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDM Versus FDM/TDM for Unequal Error Protection in Terrestrial Broadcasting Systems: An Information-Theoretic View","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182743/","displayDocTitle":"LDM Versus FDM/TDM for Unequal Error Protection in Terrestrial Broadcasting Systems: An Information-Theoretic View","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182743/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15660686","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001821","fundingName":"WWTF","grantNumber":"ICT12-054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDM Versus FDM/TDM for Unequal Error Protection in Terrestrial Broadcasting Systems: An Information-Theoretic View","sourcePdf":"tbc-gomezbarquero-2459665-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095978S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7182743","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7182744,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["Communications Research Centre Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7484797/7182744/zhang-2459656-small.gif","p":["Liang Zhang (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201914) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1996, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.

We propose a novel iterative decision-directed differential detection (iD4) algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems employing differential PSK modulation in each subcarrier. The core of iD4 is a low complexity time and frequency 2-D estimator which can effectively estimate the channel variation experienced by adjacent time domain symbols. This estimated channel variation is then compensated in the differential detection process. Both theoretical analysis and computer simulations show that significant performance improvement can be achieved using iD4 over the CDD for OFDM receivers in fast fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7484797/07182744.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2459656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2459656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Differential Detection for Differential OFDM Systems With High Mobility","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Receivers","Time-domain analysis","Estimation","Fading","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","fading channels","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential OFDM systems","conventional differential detection","CDD","iterative decision-directed differential detection algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","differential PSK modulation","computer simulations","OFDM receivers","fast fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital audio broadcasting","DAB","OFDM","decision directed","differential detection","fast fading"]},{"kwd":["Digital audio broadcasting","DAB","OFDM","decision directed","differential detection","fast fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Differential Detection for Differential OFDM Systems With High Mobility","volume":"62","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7182744/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16054521","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Differential Detection for Differential OFDM Systems With High Mobility","sourcePdf":"tbc-hong-2459656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082992S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7484797","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7484797","articleId":"7182744","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182745,"authors":[{"name":"Necmi Ta\u015fp\u0131nar","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey"],"firstName":"Necmi","lastName":"Ta\u015fp\u0131nar","id":"37355511200"},{"name":"Mahmut Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bozok University, Yozgat, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mahmut","lastName":"Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m","id":"37085755036"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7182745","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1205},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a parallel artificial bee colony (P-ABC) algorithm based on a new search strategy.

However, a multistatic FMCW architecture suitable for meeting the low-cost requirement has yet to be developed. This paper introduces a new FMCW radar architecture that implements a novel technique of synchronizing nodes in a multistatic system, known as over-the-air deramping (OTAD). The architecture uses a dual-frequency design to simultaneously broadcast an FMCW waveform on a lower frequency channel directly to a receiver as a reference synchronization signal, and a higher frequency channel to illuminate the measurement scene. The target echo is deramped in hardware with the synchronization signal. OTAD allows for low-cost multistatic systems with fine range-resolution, and low peak power and sampling rate requirements. Furthermore, the approach avoids problems with direct signal interference. OTAD is shown to be a compelling solution for low-cost multistatic radar systems through the experimental measurements using a newly developed OTAD radar system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Noise","Sensors","Mixers","Radar antennas","Radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistatic FMCW radar architecture","over-the-air deramping","synchronizing nodes","dual-frequency design","receiver","reference synchronization signal","target echo","low-cost multistatic systems","fine range-resolution","peak power","sampling rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FMCW radar","bistatic radar","multistatic radar"]},{"kwd":["FMCW radar","bistatic radar","multistatic radar","passive radar","passive bistatic radar","micro-Doppler","distributed sensors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2466477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07182747.pdf","startPage":"7045","endPage":"7053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2466477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Multistatic FMCW Radar Architecture by Over-the-Air Deramping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Multistatic FMCW Radar Architecture by Over-the-Air Deramping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182747/","volume":"15","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182747/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15500124","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University College London through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/K00767X/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Multistatic FMCW Radar Architecture by Over-the-Air Deramping","sourcePdf":"jsen-ash-2466477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060517S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7182747","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7182754,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Hsuan Lee","affiliation":["Innovation Center for Big Data and Digital Convergence, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7286895/7182754/lee-2464712-small.gif","p":["Yu-Hsuan Lee was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1979.

How to achieve a higher hardware efficiency becomes an attractive issue to design each critical building bock in sensor node. DSRC standards usually adopt either FM0 code or Manchester code as a coding technique to enhance signal reliability. In this paper, a fully reused VLSI architecture of FM0/Manchester codec with a hardware utilization rate (HUR) of 100% is proposed for DSRC-based sensor node. It is based on the half-cycle processing model (HCPM). The HCPM includes three core techniques: 1) half-cycle logic partition; 2) reused-based retiming; and 3) Boolean function reshaping. The HCPM can improve the HUR of FM0/Manchester codec from 27.33% to 100% with the reduction of the transistor count from 86 to 66. A 100% HUR means every transistor is activated; therefore, a more power is consumed. With a design tradeoff between HUR and power consumption, this paper still presents a higher energy efficiency. This paper is realized in TSMC 0.18-\u03bcm 1P6M CMOS technology. The silicon area of core circuit is 33 \u00d7 120 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. The experiment results demonstrate that this paper presents a competitive performance with 100% HUR compared with the existing works. With this paper, DSRC-based sensor nodes can present a 100% HUR FM0/Manchester codec, fully supporting DSRC standards of Europe, USA, and Japan.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Decoding","Hardware","Codecs","Xenon","Sensors","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated logic circuits","intelligent transportation systems","network coding","transistor circuits","vehicular ad hoc networks","VLSI","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dedicated short range communication","intelligent transportation system","ITS","sensor netwoking","DSRC standard","FM0 code","Manchester code","coding technique","signal reliability","VLSI architecture","hardware utilization rate","HUR","DSRC-based sensor node","half-cycle processing model","HCPM","half-cycle logic partition","reused-based retiming","Boolean function reshaping","transistor count reduction","power consumption","energy efficiency","TSMC 1P6M CMOS technology","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DSRC","VLSI","FM0 code","Manchester code","Hardware utilization rate (HUR)"]},{"kwd":["DSRC","VLSI","FM0 code","Manchester code","hardware utilization rate (HUR)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182754","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2464712","startPage":"6875","endPage":"6889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07182754.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2464712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182754/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Architecture Design of FM0/Manchester Codec With 100% Hardware Utilization Rate for DSRC-Based Sensor Nodes in ITS Applications","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"15","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15488992","htmlLink":"/document/7182754/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"103-2221-E-155-073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Architecture Design of FM0/Manchester Codec With 100% Hardware Utilization Rate for DSRC-Based Sensor Nodes in ITS Applications","sourcePdf":"jsen-lee-2464712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101199S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7182754","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182756,"authors":[{"name":"Md Mamun Al-Rashid","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7210242/7182756/alras-2453118-small.gif","p":["Md Mamun Al-Rashid received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2012.

In an effort to mitigate this problem, we have studied the effect of nanomagnet geometry on error rates, focusing on elliptical and cylindrical geometries. We had previously reported that in elliptical nanomagnets, the out-of-plane excursion of the magnetization vector during switching creates a precessional torque that plays a dual role-it speeds up the switching, but is also responsible for the high switching error probability. The absence of this torque in cylindrical magnets should lower error rates, but our simulations show that the error rate actually does not improve significantly compared with elliptical magnets while the switching becomes unacceptably slow. Here, we show that DC-NML employing elliptical nanomagnets can offer relatively high reliability for NML (switching error probability <;$10^{-8}$ ), moderate clock speed ($\\sim 100$ MHz), and two to three orders of magnitude energy saving compared with CMOS devices, provided the shape anisotropy energy barrier of the nanomagnet is increased to at least $\\sim 5.5$ eV to allow engineering a stronger dipole coupling between neighboring nanomagnets.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2453118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7210242/07182756.pdf","startPage":"2978","endPage":"2986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2453118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7210242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Nanomagnet Geometry on Reliability, Energy Dissipation, and Clock Speed in Strain-Clocked DC-NML","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182756/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Nanomagnet Geometry on Reliability, Energy Dissipation, and Clock Speed in Strain-Clocked DC-NML","volume":"62","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15381690","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182756/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations through the National Science Foundation CAREER","grantNumber":"CCF-1253370"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Nanomagnet Geometry on Reliability, Energy Dissipation, and Clock Speed in Strain-Clocked DC-NML","sourcePdf":"ted-alrashid-2453118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055461S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7210242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7210242","articleId":"7182756","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182758,"authors":[{"name":"Ali A.

First, we use a Markov chain to model the multi-hop system with truncated HARQ type-I (HARQ-I) and derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and throughput; we also obtain lower and upper bounds on the energy efficiency of the system. Then, we extend the analysis to cover HARQ with packet combining where we provide a general formulation of the outage probability; in special cases, closed-form expressions for outage probability and throughput are obtained. Finally, for a multi-hop system with opportunistic routing, we present recursive formulas to obtain outage probability and throughput. The expressions we derived allow us to draw conclusions about the outage diversity of different multi-hop protocols. In particular, we show that the diversity order is improved for opportunistic multi-hop system and is linearly increasing with the number of allowed transmissions for each packet. Numerical results illustrate how the analytical expression can be used to compare various multi-hop HARQ transmission strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07182758.pdf","startPage":"3525","endPage":"3536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truncated HARQ-Based Multi-Hop Systems: Outage and Related Performance Metrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182758/","displayDocTitle":"Truncated HARQ-Based Multi-Hop Systems: Outage and Related Performance Metrics","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524656","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182758/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truncated HARQ-Based Multi-Hop Systems: Outage and Related Performance Metrics","sourcePdf":"tcomm-haghighi-2466237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093139S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7182758","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182770,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Herrera","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7857818/7182770/herre-2457909-small.gif","p":["Luis Herrera (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee at Martin, Martin, TN, USA, in 2010, with a minor in physics.

Due to their high bandwidth, they can be simplified as a constant power load. For this reason, a nonlinear system arises where it is no longer satisfactory to assume local stability.

On the other hand, it uses a probabilistic framework to predict and to avoid collision with moving objects. The proposed methodology is implemented in real time and tested on an agricultural machinery while monitoring a grove, sharing the workspace with field workers, and using the previously published path tracking controllers. The results obtained showed an improvement of 17% (average) of the controllers' performance and an improvement of 40% (average) in the time associated with the navigation process.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2015.2450180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/7410136/07182772.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"755","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2015.2450180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Sampling Technique for Path Tracking Controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Sampling Technique for Path Tracking Controllers","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7182772/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15787091","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002848","fundingName":"Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Tecnol\u00f3gica","grantNumber":"FONDECYT 1140575"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Sampling Technique for Path Tracking Controllers","sourcePdf":"tcst-auatcheein-2450180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059781S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"7410136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7410136","articleId":"7182772","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7182774,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobing Nie","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7299729/7182774/nie-2458978-small.gif","p":["Xiaobing Nie received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Yantai Normal University, Yantai, China, in 1999, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from East China Normal University, Shanghai, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2010.","He was a Visiting Researcher with the University of Western Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia, from 2014 to 2015.

Unlike traditional D2D communication, where two mobile devices in the proximity establish a direct local link bypassing the base station, in this work, we focus on relay-aided D2D communication. Relay-aided transmission could enhance the performance of D2D communication when D2D user equipments (UEs) are far apart from each other and/or the quality of D2D link is not good enough for direct communication. Considering the uncertainties in wireless links, we model and analyze the performance of a relay-aided D2D communication network, where the relay nodes serve both the cellular and D2D users. In particular, we formulate the radio resource allocation problem in a two-hop network to guarantee the data rate of the UEs while protecting other receiving nodes from interference. Utilizing time sharing strategy, we provide a centralized solution under bounded channel uncertainty. With a view to reducing the computational burden at relay nodes, we propose a distributed solution approach using stable matching to allocate radio resources in an efficient and computationally inexpensive way. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed method is close to the centralized optimal solution and there is a distance margin beyond which relaying of D2D traffic improves network performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07182781.pdf","startPage":"3882","endPage":"3897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Relay-Aided Device-to-Device Communication Under Channel Uncertainties: A Stable Matching Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Interference","Uncertainty","Optimization","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio equipment","radio links","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed resource allocation","relay aided device-to-device communication","channel uncertainties","stable matching approach","wireless device-to-device","D2D communication","cellular network","mobile devices","direct local link","relay aided transmission","D2D user equipments","UE","D2D link quality","direct communication","wireless links","relay-aided D2D communication network","relay nodes","D2D users","cellular users","radio resource allocation problem","time sharing strategy","bounded channel uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-device (D2D) communication","LTEA L3 relay","uncertain channel state information","distributed resource allocation","stable matching"]},{"kwd":["Device-to-device (D2D) communication","LTE-A L3 relay","uncertain channel state information","distributed resource allocation","stable matching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Relay-Aided Device-to-Device Communication Under Channel Uncertainties: A Stable Matching Approach","volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7182781/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524639","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","grantNumber":"STPGP 430285"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Relay-Aided Device-to-Device Communication Under Channel Uncertainties: A Stable Matching Approach","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hossain-2466238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147559S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7182781","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182783,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoman Kang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7182783/kang-2450500-small.gif","p":["Kyoman Kang was born in Gunpo, Korea, in 1987.

In the case of an average-8T SRAM architecture, a full-swing local bitline (BL) that is connected to the gate of the read buffer can be achieved with a boosted wordline (WL) voltage. However, in the case of an average-8T SRAM based on an advanced technology, such as a 22-nm FinFET technology, where the variation in threshold voltage is large, the boosted WL voltage cannot be used, because it degrades the read stability of the SRAM. Thus, a full-swing local BL cannot be achieved, and the gate of the read buffer cannot be driven by the full supply voltage (VDD), resulting in a considerably large read delay. To overcome the above disadvantage, in this paper, a differential SRAM architecture with a full-swing local BL is proposed. In the proposed SRAM architecture, full swing of the local BL is ensured by the use of cross-coupled pMOSs, and the gate of the read buffer is driven by a full V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n, without the need for the boosted WL voltage. Various configurations of the proposed SRAM architecture, which stores multiple bits, are analyzed in terms of the minimum operating voltage and area per bit. The proposed SRAM that stores four bits in one block can achieve a minimum voltage of 0.42 V and a read delay that is 62.6 times lesser than that of the average-8T SRAM based on the 22-nm FinFET technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","volume":"24","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15874347","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7182783/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Full-Swing Local Bitline SRAM Architecture Based on the 22-nm FinFET Technology for Low-Voltage Operation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002994","fundingName":"IT Research and Development Program through the Ministry of Knowledge Economy/Korea Evaluation Institute of Technology","grantNumber":"10039174"},{"fundingName":"Technology Development of 22-nm Level Foundry Device and PDK"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Swing Local Bitline SRAM Architecture Based on the 22-nm FinFET Technology for Low-Voltage Operation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jung-2450500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060838S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7436835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7436835","articleId":"7182783","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7182786,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7337347/7182786/zhou-2459660-small.gif","p":["Jie Zhou received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2006.

One way to reduce PAPR is to apply a set of selected partial transmission sequence (PTS) to the transmit signals. However, PTS selection is a highly complex NP-hard problem and the computational complexity is very high when a large number of subcarriers are used in the OFDM system. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic PTS selection method, the modified chaos clonal shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MCCSFLA). MCCSFLA is inspired by natural clonal selection of a frog colony, it is based on the chaos theory. We also analyze MCCSFLA using the Markov chain theory and prove that the algorithm can converge to the global optimum. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better PAPR reduction than using others genetic, quantum evolutionary and selective mapping algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm converges faster than the genetic and quantum evolutionary algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2459660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7337347/07182786.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2459660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182786/","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660692","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182786/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170275"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2012ZX03001001-002"},{"fundingName":"Research Project of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2011B090400433"},{"fundingName":"Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-zhou-2459660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126236S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7182786","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182789,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Joong Kim","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Seong Joong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085389477"},{"name":"Romesh Kumar Nandwana","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Romesh Kumar","lastName":"Nandwana","id":"37073043400"},{"name":"Qadeer Khan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Qadeer","lastName":"Khan","id":"37265108200"},{"name":"Robert C.

As analog cells can behave in an unpredictable way when critical areas interact with the particle hitting, there is a need for designers to have a software tool that allows an automatic and exhaustive analysis of Single-Event Effects influence. AFTU takes the test-bench SPECTRE design, emulates radiation conditions and automatically evaluates vulnerabilities using user-defined heuristics. To illustrate the utility of the tool, the SEE sensitivity of a 13-bits Successive Approximation Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) has been analysed. This circuit was selected not only because it was designed for space applications, but also due to the fact that a manual SEE sensitivity analysis would be too time-consuming. After a user-defined test campaign, it was detected that some voltage transients were propagated to a node where a parasitic diode was activated, affecting the offset cancelation, and therefore the whole resolution of the ADC. A simple modification of the scheme solved the problem, as it was verified with another automatic SEE sensitivity analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Analytical models","Transistors","Sensitivity analysis","Approximation methods","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","analogue-digital conversion","fault tolerance","logic design","logic testing","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","radiation hardening (electronics)","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic single event effects","automatic SEE sensitivity analysis","analog-to-digital converter","successive approximation ADC","Analog Fault Tolerant University of Seville Debugging System","analog-mixed signal microelectronic circuits","analog cells","software tool","SPECTRE design","user-defined heuristics","user-defined test campaign","voltage transients","parasitic diode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter","BiCMOS","mixed-signal IC","modeling and simulation of radiation effects","radiation hardening by design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2456831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7203194/07182792.pdf","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2456831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Single Event Effects Sensitivity Analysis of a 13-Bit Successive Approximation ADC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Single Event Effects Sensitivity Analysis of a 13-Bit Successive Approximation ADC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182792/","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182792/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15365065","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Single Event Effects Sensitivity Analysis of a 13-Bit Successive Approximation ADC","sourcePdf":"tns-lopezmorillo-2456831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228235S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7203194","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7203194","articleId":"7182792","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7182796,"authors":[{"name":"Hans J.

In the symmetric and synchronous setting, we propose a novel Cycle-Adjustable Channel Hopping (CACH) scheme to achieve the MTTR lower bound (when the channel loading is bounded above by 1/u with u being a prime power). Thus, the MTTR lower bound is tight and the CACH scheme is optimal in minimizing MTTR among all the symmetric and synchronous CH schemes under the same channel loading constraint. In the asymmetric setting, we show that the classical wait-for-mommy strategy can be used to achieve the MCTTR lower bound, and thus it is optimal. In the symmetric and asynchronous setting, we also show a hierarchical construction of an asynchronous CH sequence by using two smaller asynchronous CH sequences. To further understand the effect of channel loading to the other performance metrics in a CRN, we perform various computer simulations for various CH schemes. Our simulation results show that the average time-to-rendezvous of CACH is independent of the total number of channels, and it is also robust to the disturbance of primary users.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7544544/07182797.pdf","startPage":"2343","endPage":"2356","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2453403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2453403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tight Lower Bounds for Channel Hopping Schemes in Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loading","Measurement","Cognitive radio","IEEE transactions","Optimization","Search problems","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","minimisation","radio networks","sequences","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tight lower bounds","cognitive radio networks","two-user multichannel rendezvous problem","CRN","maximum time-to-rendezvous","maximum conditional time-to-rendezvous","MCTTR","channel loading constraint","cycle-adjustable channel hopping scheme","CACH scheme","MTTR lower bound","MTTR minimization","symmetric CH scheme","synchronous CH scheme","wait-for-mommy strategy","MCTTR lower bound","hierarchical construction","asynchronous CH sequence","performance metrics","computer simulations","primary users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel hopping","cognitive radio networks","Galois field","rendezvous search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Tight Lower Bounds for Channel Hopping Schemes in Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7182797/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231782","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tight Lower Bounds for Channel Hopping Schemes in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-liao-2453403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112653S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7182797","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182801,"authors":[{"name":"Lin-Yu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/7247780/7182801/7182801-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin-Yu Lu was born in Taichung, Taiwan, on February 20, 1987.

High penetration of DIC-based micro-grid may result in poor frequency and voltage response during large disturbance. In order to overcome this difficulty, the virtual synchronous generator (VSGs) was proposed recently in which the DIC mimics conventional synchronous generators (SGs) by designing proper parameters of the SG into each local droop control mechanism of the DIC. Meanwhile, due to the recent advances of distributed control, the concept of consensus-based control can be applied to study this droop control problem of VSGs. One important feature of this consensus-based control is that it can be implemented on each local DIC with communications among their neighboring DICs. In contrast to most existing secondary control schemes, no central controller is required. Under this framework, if DICs are redesigned as VSGs, the frequency and voltage of each DIC can be restored to their pre-specified values obtained from the steady-state analysis. In addition, the proper real and reactive power sharing still can be achieved according to the nominal rating of each DIC. The stability of the closed-loop system is ensured by the transient energy function under certain mild conditions. Numerical experiments of a 14-bus/6-DIC micro-grid system on real-time simulators are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2462093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/7247780/07182801.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2462093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus-Based Secondary Frequency and Voltage Droop Control of Virtual Synchronous Generators for Isolated AC Micro-Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Consensus-Based Secondary Frequency and Voltage Droop Control of Virtual Synchronous Generators for Isolated AC Micro-Grids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182801/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15433145","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7182801/","volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"102-2221-E-007-074, 103-2221-E-007-084, 104-2221-E-007-083 and 104-3113-E-002-013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus-Based Secondary Frequency and Voltage Droop Control of Virtual Synchronous Generators for Isolated AC Micro-Grids","sourcePdf":"jetcas-chu-2462093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142546S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7247780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"7247780","articleId":"7182801","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7182802,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

It is the computational engine for the on-line tool CR\u00c8ME-MC. MRED is based on c++ code from Geant4 with additional Fortran components to simulate electron transport and nuclear reactions with high precision. We provide a detailed description of the structure of MRED and the implementation of the simulation of physical processes used to simulate radiation effects in electronic devices and circuits. Extensive discussion and references are provided that illustrate the validation of models used to implement specific simulations of relevant physical processes. Several applications of MRED are summarized that demonstrate its ability to predict and describe basic physical phenomena associated with irradiation of electronic circuits and devices. These include effects from single particle radiation (including both direct ionization and indirect ionization effects), dose enhancement effects, and displacement damage effects. MRED simulations have also helped to identify new single event upset mechanisms not previously observed by experiment, but since confirmed, including upsets due to muons and energetic electrons.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2454446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7203194/07182802.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2454446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203194","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Processes and Applications of the Monte Carlo Radiative Energy Deposition (MRED) Code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical Processes and Applications of the Monte Carlo Radiative Energy Deposition (MRED) Code","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7182802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365070","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7182802/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Physical Processes and Applications of the Monte Carlo Radiative Energy Deposition (MRED) Code","sourcePdf":"tns-reed-2454446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.218507S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7203194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7203194","articleId":"7182802","onlineDate":"10 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7182805,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen T.

Experimental results on several well-known benchmark functions demonstrate that the proposed LTQPSO performs much better than QPSO and other variants of QPSO in terms of their convergence and stability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15366367","htmlLink":"/document/7184720/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm using adaptive coefficients and natural selection method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm using adaptive coefficients and natural selection method","confLoc":"Wuyi, China","sourcePdf":"107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072637S","chronDate":"27-29 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174268","isNumber":"7184712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174268","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7184712","articleId":"7184720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7184724,"authors":[{"name":"Jianchao Fan","affiliation":["Department of Ocean Remote Sensing, School of Control Science and Engineering Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Fan","id":"37531314000"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Dalian, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280531600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7259-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7257-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7256-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7184724","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic particle swarm optimization using a wavelet mutation strategy for composite function optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184724","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Out of order","Optimization","Lead","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic particle swarm optimization","wavelet mutation strategy","composite function optimization","complex computation problem","dynamic neighborhood topology","PSO algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel dynamic particle swarm optimization is considered for composite function optimization.

In addition, each image frame is subsampled based on which a frame distance is defined. It turns out that such processing significantly lowers the computational complexity while yielding the same level of detection accuracy.

We give a simulation example to show the effectiveness of this algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2015.7184777","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2015.7184777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184712","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174268/7184712/07184777.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network-based finite horizon optimal control for partially unknown linear continuous-time systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184777/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based finite horizon optimal control for partially unknown linear continuous-time systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7184777/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15366354","publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 March 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based finite horizon optimal control for partially unknown linear continuous-time systems","confLoc":"Wuyi, China","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068703S","chronDate":"27-29 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174268","isNumber":"7184712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174268","xplore-issue":"7184712","articleId":"7184777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7184785,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["Hengshui University, Hebei, PR of China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37085351504"},{"name":"Yue Wu","affiliation":["Cangzhou Medical College, Hebei, PR of China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085345017"},{"name":"Heng Zheng","affiliation":["Hengshui University, Hebei, PR of China"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085369613"},{"name":"Wenqi Jiang","affiliation":["Hengshui University, Hebei, PR of China"],"firstName":"Wenqi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085363747"},{"name":"Zhihua Gao","affiliation":["Hengshui University, Hebei, PR of China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085354419"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7259-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7257-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7256-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7184785","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","MATLAB","Cameras","Robot vision systems","Optical imaging","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image filtering","image recognition","intelligent robots","mathematics computing","robot vision","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","binocular vision system","tennis intelligent robot","tennis recognition","shape","color filter method","image filter method","Matlab processing functions"]}],"abstract":"Aim to let the intelligent robot could quick, accurately identify and locate tennis, a new method of tennis recognition is proposed in this paper based on color and shape. First, more independent goals image are removed through color filter method and image filter method with taking advantage of Matlab processing functions. Secondly, corner pixels were extracted to complete stereovision matching in order to obtain tridimensional information of position and shape under the extreme constraints. Sufficient experiments of tennis recognition show that the algorithm which is based on single tennis characteristic has poor accuracy with parallax positioning accuracy of 76%, distance accuracy of 71% and color accuracy of 67%. However, accuracy of the algorithm which bases on three characteristics reaches 91%. The results show that the algorithm has higher robustness and tennis position can be located and distinguished more effectively, work efficiency is therefore enhanced for the intelligent robot.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for image recognition of binocular vision system by tennis intelligent robot","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2015.7184785","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174268/7184712/07184785.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2015.7184785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"A new method for image recognition of binocular vision system by tennis intelligent robot","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7184785/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15366393","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for image recognition of binocular vision system by tennis intelligent robot","confLoc":"Wuyi, China","sourcePdf":"88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064122S","chronDate":"27-29 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174268","isNumber":"7184712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174268","xplore-issue":"7184712","articleId":"7184785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7184820,"authors":[{"name":"Phumlani T.

It shall include a cloud architecture which is a Mobile information system and would be used by farmers (including subsistence farmers) to share (upload and download) information about the farming techniques, markets, weather, seeds, etc. In this paper, we present findings of a preliminary study of what common mobile devices are mostly used and what type of agriculture is mostly practiced by MRAs people. We collected data through close ended questionnaires that were given to farmers in Pongola in KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The preliminary study results show that 54% of farmers face challenges of pests and birds, 26% weather and 20% diseases affecting their livestock. 94% of farmers own mobile devices of which 59% of them are feature phones. 58% of the mobile phone owning farmers do not use them to access information regarding farming and lastly the most practiced type of agriculture in MRAs is subsistence farming with 97%, where famers focus on growing enough food to feed their own consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ETNCC.2015.7184820","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Networks

radio ad-hoc networks: Attacks and its impact","abstract":"In the current scenario Cognitive Radio (CR) is the best available solution to overcome spectrum shortage problem. Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (CRAHNs) is the use of CR technology in the wireless ad-hoc network scenario. The field of CRAHNs is still in this nascent stage therefore not much work has been done related to security issues associated with these types of networks. In order to provide secure data transmission over these networks it is mandatory to make these networks robust and less vulnerable against the various types of attacks. Through this report we have presented an implementation and simulation study of Network Layer Attacks primarily Black Hole Attack and Gray Hole Attack in detail with their impacts on the various network parameters. The Black Hole Attack is a type of Denial of Service(DoS) attack where the node that has turned malicious advertises itself as the most optimal path to reach the destination, thus drawing all the traffic towards itself and later either it drops all the received packets or prevent them from reaching their destinations. The Gray Hole Attack is a variation of black hole attack in which selective forwarding principles are used to selectively drop some data and to forward the rest. In this Project using NS2 with the CRAHN extension as the simulator, effect of these attacks on the various network parameters of CRAHNs have been recorded and compared to present an oversight of how performance is affected whenever the network gets injected with these attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184821/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15365900","publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7184821/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio ad-hoc networks: Attacks and its impact","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio ad-hoc networks: Attacks and its impact","confLoc":"Windhoek, Namibia","sourcePdf":"2364PID3720111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071262S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164876","isNumber":"7184793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164876","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7184793","articleId":"7184821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7184824,"authors":[{"name":"Ireyuwa E.

The temperature changes would adversely affect 2D wavelength-hopping time-spreading optical code by causing a reduction in the expected height of the autocorrelation peak. Environmental temperature variation is usually difficult to accurately determine and compensate for due to its dynamic nature and fluctuations. Furthermore, the power control strategy allows the regulation of the transmitted power in order to dynamically mitigate the effects of temperature variation. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is evocated to solve the problem of power control based on the signal-to-noise plus interference ratio optimization to mitigate the environmental effects. Afterward, numerical results are discussed taking into account the code parameters, such as the code weight and spectral spacing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/7184833/07184838.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"717","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.7.000707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.7.000707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of environmental temperature variation effects in OCDMA networks using PSO power control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Power control","Noise","Optical fiber networks","Optical fiber dispersion","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexing","interference (signal)","optical communication","particle swarm optimisation","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental temperature variation mitigation","optical code division multiple access networks","OCDMA network","particle swarm optimization algorithm","PSO power control","2D wavelength-hopping time-spreading optical code","autocorrelation peak","transmitted power","signal-to-noise plus interference ratio optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heuristic search","Optical networks","Particle swarm optimization","Power control","Signal-to-noise plus interference ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of environmental temperature variation effects in OCDMA networks using PSO power control","volume":"7","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15364313","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of environmental temperature variation effects in OCDMA networks using PSO power control","sourcePdf":"707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042229S","chronDate":"August  2015","isNumber":"7184833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7184838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7184840,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago M.

This expression is obtained by adapting the analytical model for XPM-induced intensity-modulated fluctuations derived in the past for conventional on-off keying systems to DSB-OFDM systems employing DD receivers. It is shown that the normalized variance can be used as an error vector magnitude (EVM) estimator in DD DSB-OFDM systems dominantly impaired by XPM. This conclusion is drawn after validating the proposed closed-form expression in two application scenarios: (1) distribution of DSB-OFDM ultra-wideband signals using a radio-over-fiber infrastructure, and (2) transmission of 10 Gb/s DSB-OFDM signals in access networks. Excellent accuracy between the EVM estimates provided by the normalized variance expression and the actual EVM of the OFDM system is demonstrated through numerical simulation for a large set of system parameters. When the carrier-to-signal power ratio (CSPR) is high, an EVM discrepancy not exceeding 0.3 dB is obtained in most of the analyzed cases. When the CSPR decreases to 0 dB, the discrepancy between the actual EVM and the normalized variance does not exceed 0.5 dB. A maximum discrepancy between the actual EVM and the normalized variance around 1 dB is also shown when the spectral occupancy of the DSB-OFDM signal leads to a dispersion-induced power fading in the most affected subcarrier as high as 20 dB. These results suggest that the proposed closed-form expression is a powerful tool to provide fast and accurate estimates of the XPM-limited capacity of wavelength division multiplexing DSB-OFDM systems employing direct detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment of XPM-limited direct-detection short-reach DSB OFDM optical systems","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.7.000736","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/7184833/07184840.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.7.000736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of XPM-limited direct-detection short-reach DSB OFDM optical systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15364321","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of XPM-limited direct-detection short-reach DSB OFDM optical systems","sourcePdf":"736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04517S","chronDate":"August  2015","isNumber":"7184833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","articleId":"7184840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7184841,"authors":[{"name":"Yanni Ou","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, Bristol, GB"],"firstName":"Yanni","lastName":"Ou"},{"name":"Ali Hammad","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, Bristol, GB"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Hammad"},{"name":"Shuping Peng","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, Bristol, GB"],"firstName":"Shuping","lastName":"Peng"},{"name":"Reza Nejabati","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, Bristol, GB"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Nejabati"},{"name":"Dimitra Simeonidou","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, Bristol, GB"],"firstName":"Dimitra","lastName":"Simeonidou"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"7184841","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"abstract":"Future high-performance network-based applications are delivered over the high-capacity dynamic optical network. Each of these applications requires dedicated network service, which can be provided by the virtual optical network (VON) created by optical network virtualization. The virtualizable bandwidth variable transceiver (V-BVT) is a key enabling technology for optical network virtualization. In this paper, we propose the virtualization of V-BVT to support the virtualization of optical orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing-based elastic optical network. We present a novel V-BVT architecture, and introduce both online and offline virtualization algorithms for V-BVT. Accordingly, multiple independent but coexisting virtual transceivers that share the same physical transceiver resources are created, in order to serve separate VONs. To guarantee the isolation of the created virtual transceivers together with their quality of transmission (QoT), the impact of physical layer impairments on different V-BVT solutions is also considered and integrated into the virtualization algorithms. In the offline virtualization, both heuristic and integral linear programming methods are proposed, in order to maximize the VON demand accommodation using the given physical V-BVT resources. In the online virtualization, a heuristic method is proposed to accommodate real-time received VON demands. By applying both algorithms, multiple virtual transceivers can be dynamically created based on the bandwidth and QoT of the VON demands. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithms, and also verify the V-BVT transmission performance through simulation studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online and offline virtualization of optical transceiver","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.7.000748","endPage":"760","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/7184833/07184841.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","startPage":"748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.7.000748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184841","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtualization","Transceivers","Optical fiber networks","Bandwidth","Optical modulation","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","optical transceivers","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["future high-performance network-based applications","high-capacity dynamic optical network","virtual optical network","optical network virtualization","virtualizable bandwidth variable transceiver","optical orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing-based elastic optical network","online virtualization algorithms","offline virtualization algorithms","virtual transceivers","physical transceiver resources","quality of transmission","QoT","physical layer impairments","heuristic programming methods","integral linear programming methods","VON demand accommodation","V-BVT transmission performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["O-OFDM","Optical network virtualization","Physical layer impairments (PLIs)","SBVT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online and offline virtualization of optical transceiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184841/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","volume":"7","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15364322","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online and offline virtualization of optical transceiver","sourcePdf":"748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051815S","chronDate":"August  2015","isNumber":"7184833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7184841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7184871,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxuan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yuxuan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085387810"},{"name":"Zhe Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085341640"},{"name":"Danny H.K.

Due to lack of centralized control, there is a large imbalance in the ratio of power consumption/power generation from one state to the next. This imbalance results in wasting of large quantities of power generated in states where generation exceeds consumption significantly, whereas other states are suffering from insufficient amount of power generation. Power generation is in direct correlation with the amount of resources used to generate the power. In this paper, we propose a power generation forecasting scheme that could predict the amount of power required at a rate closer to the power consumption. The proposed scheme uses Big Data analytics to process power management data collected in the past 20 years for each state. It then uses a Neural Network (NN) model to train the system for prediction of future power generation based on the collected data. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme can predict power generation close to 99% of the actual usage.","doi":"10.1109/BigDataService.2015.44","startPage":"213","endPage":"217","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE First International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182812/7184847/07184883.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE First International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigDataService.2015.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Electricity Generation Forecasting System Using Artificial Neural Network Approach with Big Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Big data","Forecasting","Power generation","Distributed databases","Encyclopedias","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","load forecasting","neural nets","power consumption","power engineering computing","power generation control","power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NN model","power management data collection","Big Data analytics","power generation control","power management system","power consumption","US","United States","electricity generation forecasting system","artificial neural network approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artifical Neural Network","Electricity Generation Forecast","Big Data","Backpropagation","Hadoop","MapReduce"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Electricity Generation Forecasting System Using Artificial Neural Network Approach with Big Data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7184883/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15381096","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Electricity Generation Forecasting System Using Artificial Neural Network Approach with Big Data","confLoc":"Redwood City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8128a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054293S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7182812","isNumber":"7184847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7182812","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7184847","articleId":"7184883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7184916,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Hao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Tony Hao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085384260"},{"name":"Enid Wai-Yung Kwong","affiliation":["School of Nursing The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Enid Wai-Yung","lastName":"Kwong","id":"37085468628"},{"name":"Grantham Kwok-Hung Pang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Grantham Kwok-Hung","lastName":"Pang","id":"37324964100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8128-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7184916","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blood pressure","Artificial neural networks","Training","Electrocardiography","Biomedical monitoring","Heart rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Big Data","blood pressure measurement","medical computing","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical application","systolic blood pressure prediction","artificial neural network","big data processing","correlated factors","gender","serum cholesterol","fasting blood sugar","electrocardiography signal","back-propagation neural network","radial basis function network","biomedical prediction system","neural network training","performance testing","blood pressure measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Systolic blood pressure","hypertension","bio-medical","big data application","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184916","abstract":"This paper presents a new study based on artificial neural network, which is a typical technique for processing big data, for the prediction of systolic blood pressure by correlated factors (gender, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar and electrocardiography signal).

In previous works, the idea of evaluating multiple pixel determinations of the position of OD on captured fundus images by a multiple Processor has been adopted. In this work, a NN-based Positioning Interface, constituted by a Retinal Imaging System, a Neural Validity Classifier and a Positioning Processor for an accurate localization of the Reference point of OD, is developed. More in detail, the locations of multiple candidates are accurately validated by synthesizing a Neural Network behaving as a Classifier of Validity for regular/abnormal candidate reference points.

In the present study, we aim to evaluate electroencephalography-electromyography (EEG-EMG) co-registration features of rest and walking in basal condition and under cognitive tasks in normal subjects to characterize a \u201cnormal gait\u201d and to define the possible paradigm to detect abnormal behavior. We realized EEG-EMG co-registration in 17 healthy subjects in different conditions: 1) sitting, 2) standing 3) walking. A P300 oddball paradigm was performed during 4) standing condition and 5) during walking. We found that the P300 component amplitude increases during physical activity. The negative correlation between age and P300 component vanishes during gait. The spectral width of the total alpha rhythm appears reduced in the course of P300 in a static situation, with likely phenomena of desynchronization related to cognitive task. During gait, the activity is canceled, suggesting a state of \"idling\" of cortical areas previously involved in the process of recognition of the target stimulus. Additionally, EMG co-contraction and \u03bc-rhythm desynchronization (\u03bc-ERDs) are also analyzed using wireless equipment. It is demonstrated the EMG co-contraction validity, showing the possibility to discern a normal gait (tot. steps: 60; max co-contraction time: 100ms; average: 20ms) from a perturbed one (tot. steps: 60; max co-contraction time: 260ms; mean: 70ms). \u03bc-ERDs were detected in about 60% of the analyzed steps, showing medium variations in \u03bc - power of about -2.4.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165101/7184925/07184949.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"2015 6th International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2015.7184949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASI.2015.7184949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184925","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined EEG/EMG evaluation during a novel dual task paradigm for gait analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Legged locomotion","Electroencephalography","Muscles","Electrodes","Rhythm","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","diseases","electroencephalography","electromyography","gait analysis","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG-EMG evaluation","dual task paradigm","gait analysis","neural dynamics","natural motor behavior","neurological diseases","electroencephalography-electromyography coregistration features","walking","basal condition","cognitive tasks","EEG-EMG coregistration","P300 oddball paradigm","P300 component amplitude","physical activity","total alpha rhythm","desynchronization","cortical areas","EMG co-contraction","\u03bc-rhythm desynchronization","wireless equipment","\u03bc-ERD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG","EMG","dual task","P300","gait analysis","ERD","EMG co-contraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Combined EEG/EMG evaluation during a novel dual task paradigm for gait analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7184949/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15365932","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"18-19 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined EEG/EMG evaluation during a novel dual task paradigm for gait analysis","confLoc":"Gallipoli, Italy","sourcePdf":"CombinedEEGEMGEvaluation.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056134S","chronDate":"18-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165101","isNumber":"7184925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165101","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7184925","articleId":"7184949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7184952,"authors":[{"name":"Woongrae Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Techeology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Woongrae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085550073"},{"name":"Chang-Chih Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Techeology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chang-Chih","lastName":"Chen","id":"38466562000"},{"name":"Taizhi Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Techeology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Taizhi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085436076"},{"name":"Soonyoung Cha","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Techeology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Soonyoung","lastName":"Cha","id":"37085411159"},{"name":"Linda Milor","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Techeology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Milor","id":"37085415952"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8981-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7184952","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of remaining life using embedded SRAM for wearout parameter extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184952","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","SRAM cells","Stress","Logic gates","Electromigration","Electric breakdown"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","integrated circuit testing","life testing","semiconductor device reliability","SRAM chips","wear testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remaining life estimation","embedded SRAM","wearout parameter extraction","system health monitor","on-chip built-in self test","BIST"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lifetime","Wearout parameter","Built-In Self-Test (BIST)","Backend dielectric breakdown","Electromigration","Stress-induced voiding","Gate oxide breakdown","Bias temperature instability"]}],"abstract":"Safety critical systems need methods for chips to monitor their health in the field.

As these sensing systems are usually battery-powered and gas sensors are power-hungry, energy-efficient design and power management are required to extend the device's lifetime. In this paper, we present a two-stage concept where a novel low-power carbon nanotube is used as a gas detector for an energy-consuming metal-oxide (MOX) semiconductor gas sensor. We propose a design of a heterogeneous sensor node where we exploit the low-power nanotube gas sensor and the more accurate MOX sensor. This work performs energy consumption simulations for three event-driven scenarios to evaluate the power consumption reduction, as well as the limitations of carbon nanotubes. Our results show the benefits of the proposed approach over the scenarios with adaptive duty-cycling with only MOX gas sensors, proved with 20%-35% node lifetime prolongation. The delay introduced due to the nanotube recovery time can be overcome by radio duty-cycled activity for detecting alarm messages from the neighbour nodes.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7184980","publicationTitle":"2015 6th International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165101/7184925/07184980.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7184925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASI.2015.7184980","startPage":"271","endPage":"276","doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2015.7184980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7184980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards Internet of Things for event-driven low-power gas sensing using carbon nanotubes","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"18-19 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7184980/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15365927","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Internet of Things for event-driven low-power gas sensing using carbon nanotubes","confLoc":"Gallipoli, Italy","sourcePdf":"TowardsInternetofThingsforEvent.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092521S","chronDate":"18-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165101","isNumber":"7184925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165101","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7184925","articleId":"7184980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7185011,"authors":[{"name":"Jinxin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7185003/7185011/7185011-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinxin Zhao was born in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, in 1990.

It is also useful for broad view ultrasound imaging. Traditional coherent plane wave compounding coherently sums the echo data of different steered transmitting waves as the output. The data correlation information of different emissions is not considered. Therefore, some adaptive techniques can be introduced into the compounding procedure. In this paper, we propose a Joint Transmitting-Receiving (JTR) adaptive beamforming scheme for plane wave compounding. Unlike traditional adaptive beamformers, the proposed beamforming scheme is designed for the 2-D data set obtained from multiple plane wave firings. It calculates both the transmitting aperture weights and the receiving aperture weights and then combines them into a 2-D adaptive weight function for compounding. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and phantom data. Results show that the proposed scheme has better performance on both point targets and cysts than the existing plane wave compounding approach. Because of the adaptive process in both apertures for compounding, an improved resolution is observed in both simulation and phantom studies. When the eigenanalysis is introduced, a contrast enhancement is achieved. For the simulated cyst, a contrast ratio (CR) improvement of 48% is achieved compared with the traditional plane wave compounding. For the phantom cyst, this improvement is 213.8%. The proposed scheme also has good robustness against sound velocity errors. Therefore, it is effective in enhancing the coherent plane wave compounding quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15364345","htmlLink":"/document/7185011/","pubMedId":"26276954","displayDocTitle":"Plane wave compounding based on a joint transmitting-receiving adaptive beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plane wave compounding based on a joint transmitting-receiving adaptive beamformer","sourcePdf":"t1581440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08951S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7185003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7185003","articleId":"7185011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7185013,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Provost","affiliation":["UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France","Institut National de la Santet de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Langevin, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Provost","id":"37403598000"},{"name":"Clement Papadacci","affiliation":["UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France","Institut National de la Santet de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Langevin, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Clement","lastName":"Papadacci","id":"37071194900"},{"name":"Charlie Demene","affiliation":["UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France","Institut National de la Santet de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Langevin, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Charlie","lastName":"Demene","id":"37085384446"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Gennisson","affiliation":["UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France","Institut National de la Santet de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Langevin, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Gennisson","id":"37268830700"},{"name":"Mickael Tanter","affiliation":["UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France","Institut National de la Santet de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Langevin, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Mickael","lastName":"Tanter","id":"37276625800"},{"name":"Mathieu Pernot","affiliation":["UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR 7587, Institut Langevin, Paris, France","UMR, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France","Institut National de la Santet de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Langevin, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Pernot","id":"37264934100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-3010"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1525-8955"}],"articleNumber":"7185013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2510},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/index2.asp"}],"abstract":"Ultrafast Doppler imaging was introduced as a technique to quantify blood flow in an entire 2-D field of view, expanding the field of application of ultrasound imaging to the highly sensitive anatomical and functional mapping of blood vessels. We have recently developed 3-D ultrafast ultrasound imaging, a technique that can produce thousands of ultrasound volumes per second, based on a 3-D plane and diverging wave emissions, and demonstrated its clinical feasibility in human subjects in vivo. In this study, we show that noninvasive 3-D ultrafast power Doppler, pulsed Doppler, and color Doppler imaging can be used to perform imaging of blood vessels in humans when using coherent compounding of 3-D tilted plane waves. A customized, programmable, 1024-channel ultrasound system was designed to perform 3-D ultrafast imaging. Using a 32 \u00d7 32, 3-MHz matrix phased array (Vermon, Tours, France), volumes were beamformed by coherently compounding successive tilted plane wave emissions. Doppler processing was then applied in a voxel-wise fashion. The proof of principle of 3-D ultrafast power Doppler imaging was first performed by imaging Tygon tubes of various diameters, and in vivo feasibility was demonstrated by imaging small vessels in the human thyroid. Simultaneous 3-D color and pulsed Doppler imaging using compounded emissions were also applied in the carotid artery and the jugular vein in one healthy volunteer.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Ultrasonic imaging","In vivo","Blood","Biomedical imaging","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biological organs","biomedical equipment","biomedical ultrasonics","blood vessels","Doppler effect","haemodynamics","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D ultrafast Doppler imaging application","in vivo noninvasive blood vessel mapping","2D blood flow quantification","ultrasound imaging application","highly sensitive anatomical blood vessel mapping","highly sensitive functional blood vessel mapping","3D ultrafast ultrasound imaging","ultrasound volume production","3D plane","diverging wave emission","clinical feasibility","noninvasive 3D ultrafast power Doppler imaging","3D pulsed Doppler imaging","3D color Doppler imaging","in vivo human blood vessel imaging","coherent 3D tilted plane wave compounding","customized ultrasound system","programmable ultrasound system","1024-channel ultrasound system design","matrix phased array","beamforming","coherent tilted plane wave emission compounding","voxel-wise Doppler processing","Tygon tube imaging","Tygon tube diameter variation","in vivo human thyroid small vessel imaging","carotid artery","jugular vein","frequency 3 MHz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Blood Vessels","Humans","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Phantoms, Imaging","Thyroid Gland","Ultrasonography, Doppler"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7185003/07185013.pdf","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D ultrafast doppler imaging applied to the noninvasive mapping of blood vessels in Vivo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3-D ultrafast doppler imaging applied to the noninvasive mapping of blood vessels in Vivo","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185013/","volume":"62","issue":"8","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185013/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15364337","pubMedId":"26276956","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"3-D ultrafast doppler imaging applied to the noninvasive mapping of blood vessels in Vivo","sourcePdf":"t1581467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096549S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7185003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7185003","articleId":"7185013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7185022,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Ramalli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze, Firenze, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7185003/7185022/7185022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Ramalli was born in Prato, Italy, in 1983.

The most popular approach to limit this number is the sparse array technique, which designs the array layout by means of complex optimization algorithms. These algorithms are typically constrained by a few steering conditions, and, as such, cannot guarantee uniform side-lobe performance at all angles. The performance may be improved by the ungridded extensions of the sparse array technique, but this result is achieved at the expense of a further complication of the optimization process. In this paper, a method to design the layout of large circular arrays with a limited number of elements according to Fermat's spiral seeds and spatial density modulation is proposed and shown to be suitable for application to 3-D ultrasound imaging. This deterministic, aperiodic, and balanced positioning procedure attempts to guarantee uniform performance over a wide range of steering angles. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by simulating and comparing the performance of spiral and dense arrays. A good trade-off for small vessel imaging is found, e.g., in the 60\u03bb spiral array with 1.0\u03bb elements and Blackman density tapering window. Here, the grating lobe level is -16 dB, the lateral resolution is lower than 6\u03bb the depth of field is 120\u03bb and, the average contrast is 10.3 dB, while the sensitivity remains in a 5 dB range for a wide selection of steering angles. The simulation results may represent a reference guide to the design of spiral sparse array probes for different application fields.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Density-tapered spiral arrays for ultrasound 3-D imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007035","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7185003/07185022.pdf","startPage":"1580","endPage":"1588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","displayDocTitle":"Density-tapered spiral arrays for ultrasound 3-D imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7185022/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15364348","pubMedId":"26285181","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density-tapered spiral arrays for ultrasound 3-D imaging","sourcePdf":"t1581580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074862S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7185003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7185003","articleId":"7185022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7185038,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Ecco","affiliation":["TU Braunschweig, Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Germany"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Ecco","id":"37670486500"},{"name":"Selma Saidi","affiliation":["TU Braunschweig, Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Germany"],"firstName":"Selma","lastName":"Saidi","id":"37718443300"},{"name":"Adam Kostrzewa","affiliation":["TU Braunschweig, Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Germany"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Kostrzewa","id":"37085575629"},{"name":"Rolf Ernst","affiliation":["TU Braunschweig, Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37297213900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7711-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3109"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3117"}],"articleNumber":"7185038","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","DRAM chips","Throughput","Delays","Privatization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","quality of service","real-time systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time DRAM throughput guarantees","latency-sensitive mixed QoS MPSoC","low-latency best-effort service","low-latency BE service","real-time memory controllers","traffic classes","GT requestors","BE requestors","formal timing analysis","tight guarantees","latency reduction"]}],"abstract":"The trend towards integration is leading to the design of multi- and many-core platforms that accommodate processing tiles (requestors) with different memory requirements. Such platforms require a memory controller capable of providing low-latency best-effort (BE) service for some requestors and guaranteed throughput (GT) for others. Although there are realtime controllers that support the concept of different traffic classes, they do not efficiently handle scenarios with multiple BE and GT requestors. We propose a memory controller that tackles this problem, providing low latency for BE requestors and real-time guarantees for GT ones. We support the guarantees with a formal timing analysis.

These approaches provide language abstractions for system design, allowing to focus on their relevant properties. Unfortunately, such approaches still suffer from several shortcomings including the lack of well-defined semantics. Therefore, it remains difficult to connect the MDE specification tools and the design tools that are based on formal grounds and well-defined semantics to perform analysis, validation or system synthesis for RTES. This paper presents a top-down RTES design flow aiming to reduce the gap between MDE and formal design approaches. We present the connection between a framework dedicated to the enrichment of modeling languages such as UML with formal semantics, a framework based on formal models of computation supporting validation by simulation, and a system synthesis tool targeting a flexible platform with well-defined execution services. Our purpose is to cover several system design phases from specification, simulation down to implementation on a platform. As a case study, a JPEG Encoder application was realized following the different design steps of the tool-chain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2015.7185067","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems (SIES)","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems (SIES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164234/7185026/07185067.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doi":"10.1109/SIES.2015.7185067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A formal, model-driven design flow for system simulation and multi-core implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A formal, model-driven design flow for system simulation and multi-core implementation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7185067/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15365751","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A formal, model-driven design flow for system simulation and multi-core implementation","confLoc":"Siegen, Germany","sourcePdf":"SIES2015submission37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101925S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164234","isNumber":"7185026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164234","xplore-issue":"7185026","articleId":"7185067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185074,"authors":[{"name":"Otilia Popescu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Technology, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Otilia","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37284309700"},{"name":"Dimitrie C.

A widely used performance prediction method for coded multicarrier transmissions applying iteratively decoded error correction codes is based on the employment of the mean mutual information of the coded bit. A precise knowledge at the transmitter site of the log likelihood ratios distribution at the receiver facilitates the accurate performance prediction and unambiguous modeling of the decoder's behavior in a multiphase transmission. This paper proposes an analytical method to characterize the distribution of the received bits log likelihood ratios using a limited number of parameters. The paper also evaluates the accuracy provided by the proposed theoretical method by comparing its results to the ones obtained from measurements. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed method provides good accuracies both for transmissions over Gaussian and frequency-selective channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE

A simple post-detection integration at the secondary user receiver using the FB output signals is employed for signal demodulation of differential phase-shift keying symbols transmitted on a set of subcarriers. A constrained optimization design for the FB prototype filter coefficients is proposed which combines time-frequency (TF) concentration properties for spectrum sensing with system specifications in terms of the maximum allowed bit-error rate (BER) for the fading channel characteristics and models the primary user signal as a Gaussian distributed process.

The considered network comprises of one licensed primary transmitter/receiver (PT/PR) pair and one secondary transmitter/receiver (ST/SR) pair assisting for cooperation before transmitting its own signal on the licensed primary user's spectrum. The overall transmission is completed in three signaling intervals to avoid any mutual interference between users and the SSD is provided by coordinate interleaved orthogonal design (CIOD) which increases the transmission rate of the primary users. The outage probabilities of both primary and secondary users are analytically derived and supported via computer simulations. The results show that significant performance improvement is provided by the proposed protocol compared to the non-cooperation case and the reference scheme based on the transmission of superimposed primary and secondary signals which causes severe interference at both users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","startPage":"29","endPage":"33","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185080.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral efficient and interference-free spectrum sharing in cognitive radio using signal space diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7185080/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral efficient and interference-free spectrum sharing in cognitive radio using signal space diversity","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15365992","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral efficient and interference-free spectrum sharing in cognitive radio using signal space diversity","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p29babaei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054728S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185082,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hsing Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Hsing Kuo","id":"37533839200"},{"name":"Chi-Fu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Fu Lin","id":"37085349935"},{"name":"Yu-Ling Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Ling Hung","id":"37085368541"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8505-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7185082","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185082","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Cognitive radio","Interference","Throughput","Conferences","Sun","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","radiowave propagation","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","CRN routing schemes","propagation delay","hop count","TBR","cognitive radio interfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","routing","IEEE 802.22"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185082","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185082.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-oriented connection scheme for cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have become a popular research topic in recent years. Most existing CRN routing schemes focus on building a route that optimizes a single aspect of a network's performance, such as minimizing interference for primary users, or reducing the propagation delay or hop count. They do not consider the overall transmission performance for secondary users. In this work, our objective is to maximize a system's long-term estimated throughput. To this end, we propose two routing schemes, called TBR and A-TBR, for different types of cognitive radio interfaces. The schemes establish routes by considering multiple system factors, such as the interference rate and the transmission bitrate, simultaneously. The results of simulations show that the schemes yield higher throughput than existing approaches and the transmission delay is acceptable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes a solution to the long-term performance of CRNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185082/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15366014","publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185082/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-oriented connection scheme for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-oriented connection scheme for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p38kuo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051382S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185084,"authors":[{"name":"Giacomo Ricciutelli","affiliation":["DII, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Ricciutelli","id":"37085526601"},{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["DII, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"},{"name":"Nicola Maturo","affiliation":["DII, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Maturo","id":"38667145700"},{"name":"Franco Chiaraluce","affiliation":["DII, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Chiaraluce","id":"37273242300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8505-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7185084","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Error correction codes","Labeling","Polynomials","Binary phase shift keying","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","electronic messaging","modulation coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC coded modulation scheme design","unequal error protection","noise protection","transmission physical layer security","broadcast channel","message confidentiality","high-order modulation","infinite code length","low-density parity check code"]}],"abstract":"Coding and modulation schemes able to achieve unequal error protection are of interest for many applications in which parts of the payload must be differently protected against the noise. They are also useful for physical layer security of transmissions over the broadcast channel with confidential messages. Classical design approaches aim at optimizing the performance over all the protection classes, independently of the separation between them. We instead propose a solution to improve the performance over the most protected bits, at the expense of performance over the least protected ones. This allows to design coded modulation schemes with largely unequal error protection. We also consider the use of high order modulations, and propose a technique to study the performance over each protection class in the asymptotic regime of infinite code length.","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185084","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185084.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC coded modulation schemes with largely unequal error protection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185084/","displayDocTitle":"LDPC coded modulation schemes with largely unequal error protection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15366031","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185084/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC coded modulation schemes with largely unequal error protection","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p48ricciutelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074437S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185085,"authors":[{"name":"Ian P.

Using an information-theoretic framework, we derive expressions for the mutual information and consequently compute achievable secrecy rates for SSK and SM via numerical evaluations. We also characterize the secrecy behavior of SSK by showing the effects of increasing the number of antennas at the transmitter as well as the number of antennas at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. We further evaluate the secrecy rates achieved by SM with different sizes of the underlying signal constellation and compare the secrecy performance of this scheme with those of general MIMO and SIMO systems. The proposed framework unveils that SM is capable of achieving higher secrecy rates than the conventional single-antenna transmission schemes. However, it underperfoms compared to a general MIMO system in terms of the achievable secrecy rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185087.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On secrecy rate analysis of spatial modulation and space shift keying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","information theory","MIMO communication","modulation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-antenna transmission scheme","SIMO system","signal constellation","eavesdropper","receiving antenna","transmitting antenna","mutual information","information-theoretic framework","secrecy behavior","data transmission","antenna index","MIMO wireless system","multiple-input multiple-output wireless system","SSK","SM","space shift keying","spatial modulation","secrecy rate analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","MIMO wiretap channel","spatial modulation","space shift keying","secrecy capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"On secrecy rate analysis of spatial modulation and space shift keying","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185087/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15366033","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On secrecy rate analysis of spatial modulation and space shift keying","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p63rezaeiaghdam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042808S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185091,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Montorsi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Montorsi","id":"37269079500"},{"name":"Farbod Kayhan","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino"],"firstName":"Farbod","lastName":"Kayhan","id":"37868891100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8505-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7185091","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185091","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Encoding","Iterative decoding","Modulation","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved codes","next generation networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog digital belief propagation","ADBP algorithm","multistage decoding systems","next generation wireless systems","coding schemes","bit interleaved code modulation technique","BICM technique","multistage decoder","MSD"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Digital Belief Propagation and its application to multi stage decoding systems","startPage":"82","endPage":"86","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185091","abstract":"Next generation wireless systems will need to have higher spectral efficiency as the expected traffic volumes per unit bandwidth and dimension will inevitably grow. As a consequence, it is necessary to design coding schemes with performances close to the theoretical limits, having at the same time high flexibility and low complexity requirements at the receiver. In this paper we start by pointing out some of the main drawbacks of the Bit Interleaved Code Modulation (BICM) technique which is the state of the art adopted in several standards and then propose some lower complexity alternatives. These low complexity alternatives are obtained by applying the recently introduced Analog Digital Belief Propagation (ADBP) algorithm to a two stage encoding scheme. First we show that the loss in performance can be kept quite small by using a hard decoder in all stages of a multistage decoder (MSD) except the two lowest levels with a reasonable flexibility of choosing the code rates. Then we apply the ADBP algorithm to further reduce the decoding complexity of the soft decoded stages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7185091/","accessionNumber":"15366019","displayDocTitle":"Analog Digital Belief Propagation and its application to multi stage decoding systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Digital Belief Propagation and its application to multi stage decoding systems","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p82montorsi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038759S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7185092,"authors":[{"name":"Elsa Dupraz","affiliation":["ETIS - ENSEA / Univ.

For each of the existing solutions, we provide the analytic expression of the encoding error probability, and we use it to evaluate the robustness of the encoders to hardware noise. We then identify the two best encoding solutions in terms of robustness and we compare their performance with Monte-Carlo simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185092.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the robustness of LDPC encoders to hardware noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Parity check codes","Error probability","Hardware","Robustness","Decoding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","circuit reliability","codecs","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC encoder robustness","hardware noise","low density parity check encoder","faulty hardware","error model","XOR gate level","code constructions","encoding error probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the robustness of LDPC encoders to hardware noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185092/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15366008","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the robustness of LDPC encoders to hardware noise","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p87dupraz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079125S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185093,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Tajan","affiliation":["Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine, Bordeaux, Aquitaine, FR"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Tajan","id":"37712509000"},{"name":"Bouchra Benammar","affiliation":["Technological Research Institute (Saint-Exypery), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Bouchra","lastName":"Benammar","id":"37077606500"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["INPT-ENSEEIHT/IRIT, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"},{"name":"Marie-Laure Boucheret","affiliation":["INPT-ENSEEIHT/IRIT, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Laure","lastName":"Boucheret","id":"38491572500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8505-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7185093","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Detectors","Optimization","Receivers","Noise","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","compressed sensing","graph theory","iterative decoding","Nyquist criterion","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse graph based codes","Faster-Than-Nyquist signaling","FTN signaling","EXIT charts","low-density parity check codes","iterative detection","iterative decoding","FTN scheme","additive white Gaussian noise channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185093","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185093.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"96","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On coding for Faster-Than-Nyquist signaling","abstract":"In this paper, we study the design of sparse graph based codes for Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling.

In fact, it is possible to design a SC-LDPC code with any given code diversity [2]. In this work, we investigate the performance of SC-LDPC codes over block-fading channels, assuming a mismatch (or offset) between the first bit of a transmission packet and a first bit of a codeword. Such a mismatch is called the synchronisation offset, and it has a negative impact on the code diversity. We propose a data-allocation scheme for SC-LDPC codes that allows to obtain a robustness to the synchronisation offset. Combined together with the code design from [2], it allows to design efficient SC-LDPC codes, whose performance degrades only slowly under imperfect transmission conditions.","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185094","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185094.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SC-LDPC codes over the block-fading channel: Robustness to a synchronisation offset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SC-LDPC codes over the block-fading channel: Robustness to a synchronisation offset","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15366021","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185094/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185094/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SC-LDPC codes over the block-fading channel: Robustness to a synchronisation offset","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p97andriyanova.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047891S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7185105,"authors":[{"name":"Marwan Hammouda","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"],"firstName":"Marwan","lastName":"Hammouda","id":"37947660500"},{"name":"Sami Akin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Akin","id":"37393395600"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig","id":"38526253800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8505-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7185105","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Error probability","Receiving antennas","Constellation diagram","MIMO","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive SIMO","energy detection based transmission","average energy","maximum a-posteriori probability detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","energy-detection-based transmission","power allocation","map detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185105","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185105.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of energy-detection-based massive SIMO","abstract":"Recently, communications systems that are both energy efficient and reliable are under investigation. In this paper, we concentrate on an energy-detection-based transmission scheme where a communication scenario between a transmitter with one antenna and a receiver with significantly many antennas is considered. We assume that the receiver initially calculates the average energy across all antennas, and then decodes the transmitted data by exploiting the average energy level. Then, we calculate the average symbol error probability by means of a maximum a-posteriori probability detector at the receiver. Following that, we provide the optimal decision regions. Furthermore, we develop an iterative algorithm that reaches the optimal constellation diagram under a given average transmit power constraint. Through numerical analysis, we explore the system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7185105/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15365989","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of energy-detection-based massive SIMO","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of energy-detection-based massive SIMO","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p152hammouda.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061641S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185106,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Yang","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Yang","id":"38265733300"},{"name":"Thomas L.

A simple way to mitigate pilot contamination is to use a pilot reuse factor that is greater than one, which surrounds the home cell by one or more rings of non-contaminating cells. The penalty for this measure is that training consumes an increasing fraction of the slot. We perform comprehensive multiple cell semi-analytical simulations for various scenarios in order to determine the optimum pilot reuse factor. We find that in dense urban deployments, the relatively small cell size combined with low user mobility dictates pilot reuse seven. Conversely in suburban deployments pilot reuse three is optimal. Our conclusions are at variance with others who advocate pilot reuse one, which we attribute to a great extent to the fact that our performance criterion is 95% likely per user throughput rather than sum throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of pilot reuse in multi-cell Massive MIMO","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185106","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7171192/7185069/07185106.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance of pilot reuse in multi-cell Massive MIMO","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185106/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15366010","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of pilot reuse in multi-cell Massive MIMO","confLoc":"Constanta, Romania","sourcePdf":"p157yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060433S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7171192","isNumber":"7185069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7171192","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7185069","articleId":"7185106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185158,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Simonov","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore Mario Boella (ISMB), Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Simonov","id":"37945670000"},{"name":"Gianfranco Chicco","affiliation":["Energy Department, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianfranco","lastName":"Chicco","id":"37272430300"},{"name":"Gianluca Zanetto","affiliation":["TeamWare, S.r.l., Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Zanetto","id":"37085469931"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8870-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8869-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7185158","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge representation","Time series analysis","Time measurement","Energy measurement","Shape","Transient analysis","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","energy measurement","knowledge representation","metering","power engineering computing","power meters","smart power grids","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven metering knowledge representation","electrical engineering","time series","data compression","energy measurement","energy-based data knowledge representation","smart grid","nonuniform linear time finite element"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy measurement","Endurant","Perdurant","Knowledge representation","Smart grids","Tri-vector","Four-vector"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge Representation for Event-Driven Metering","abstract":"In electrical engineering, event-driven metering is a paradigm enabling different information coding with respect to the conventional time-domain metering techniques.

Some applications include evaluating musicians performance, automatic score page turning and syncing music lyrics. In this work, we describe a WiSARD-based system for real-time music tracking and evaluate the performance of the corresponding implementation. Given any audio example, the system is capable of recognizing which point of the original signal is currently playing and of dynamically tracking it. In other words, if the music restarts or jumps to another position, the system is capable of following it. This is accomplished thanks to the low complexity training and classifying of the models used, which continually keep track of all possible points of the music, and not only of the current neighboring region.

In this context, some of the widely used and tested IDS's are discussed. Anomaly-based network intrusion detection techniques are getting the attention in most of the networking fields to protect network systems against malicious acts, providing a good security level especially with the integration of neural networks in the detection systems which provided advanced methods of threats investigation and detection. This paper emphasizes the importance of anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques, the important outcomes of these systems, latest developed methods and what is expected from the future experiments in this field. Moreover, the technique of learning user profiles effects in detecting intrusions will be discussed. Finally, the lights will be shed on an offline approach using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Self Organizing Maps(SOM) which is a distinguished method in intrusion detection.","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2015.73","startPage":"497","endPage":"501","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Ninth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7181824/7185122/07185238.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 Ninth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2015.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Perception Intrusion Detection System Using Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Mobile agents","Neural networks","Monitoring","Computers","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","internetworking","multilayer perceptrons","security of data","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-perception intrusion detection systems","neural networks","computer network threats","networking security issues","IDS","anomaly-based network intrusion detection techniques","network system protection","malicious acts","security level","threat detection","user profile learning","offline approach","multilayer perceptron","MLP","self-organizing maps","SOM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion detection systems","Neural networks","Anomaly-based networks","Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"High Perception Intrusion Detection System Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185238/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15399208","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Perception Intrusion Detection System Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Santa Catarina, Brazil","sourcePdf":"8870a497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077543S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7181824","isNumber":"7185122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7181824","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7185122","articleId":"7185238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7185241,"authors":[{"name":"Donald Elmazi","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technologies, Polytechnic University of Tirana Bul, Tirana, Albania"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Elmazi","id":"37085359411"},{"name":"Tetsuya Oda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology (FIT), Higashi-Ku, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Oda","id":"37894155000"},{"name":"Algenti Lala","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technologies, Polytechnic University of Tirana Bul, Tirana, Albania"],"firstName":"Algenti","lastName":"Lala","id":"37586212900"},{"name":"Vladi Kolici","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technologies, Polytechnic University of Tirana Bul, Tirana, Albania"],"firstName":"Vladi","lastName":"Kolici","id":"37317801800"},{"name":"Leonard Barolli","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology (FIT), Higashi-Ku, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37267114100"},{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Department of Languages and Informatics Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8870-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8869-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7185241","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Software","Servers","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Weibull distribution","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["node placement analysis","wireless mesh networks","Friedman Test","genetic algorithms","hill climbing","WMN","HC","GA","size of giant component","SGC","number of covered mesh clients","NCMC","normal distribution","exponential distribution","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Mesh Networks","Friedman Test","Genetic Algorithm","Hill Climbing Algorithm","Connectivity","Coverage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185241","abstract":"In this paper, we deal with connectivity and coverage problem in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs).

But in electronic warfare, there is a game between MIMO radar and target, and clutter will affect the game. This paper proposes a novel two-step water-filling (WF) method for Stackelberg game between MIMO radar and target in the presence of clutter. Based on mutual information, WF is applied to distribute jamming power, general WF is applied to distribute signal power. Then, optimization schemes at Stackelberg equilibrium of target dominant and radar dominant can be obtained in the presence of clutter. Furthermore, reoptimization with antennas' state perceived is also achieved to cope with the destruction of part of MIMO radar transmitting antennas.

In such emerging mobile heterogeneous networks (HetNets), there are a large number of technical challenges focusing on the efficient organization, management, maintenance, and optimization, over the complicated system resources. In particular, HetNets have attracted great interest from academia and industry in deploying more effective solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, e.g., machine learning, bio-inspired algorithms, fuzzy neural network, and so on, because AI techniques can naturally handle the problems of large-scale complex systems, such as HetNets towards more intelligent and automatic-evolving ones. In this paper, we discuss the state-of-the-art AI-based techniques for evolving the smarter HetNets infrastructure and systems, focusing on the research issues of self-configuration, self-healing, and self-optimization, respectively. A detailed taxonomy of the related AI-based techniques of HetNets is also shown by discussing the pros and cons for various AI-based techniques for different problems in HetNets. Opening research issues and pending challenges are concluded as well, which can provide guidelines for future research work.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2467174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2467174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07185326.pdf","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Intelligence-Based Techniques for Emerging Heterogeneous Network: State of the Arts, Opportunities, and Challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Intelligence-Based Techniques for Emerging Heterogeneous Network: State of the Arts, Opportunities, and Challenges","volume":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185326/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15406000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185326/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2014-06119 and RGPAS-462031-2014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"Chinese Scholarship Council through the Four-Year Post-Graduate Scholarship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271182"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Artificial Intelligence-Based Techniques for Emerging Heterogeneous Network: State of the Arts, Opportunities, and Challenges","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2467174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159408S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7185326","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7185333,"authors":[{"name":"Phuc V.

Particularly, an optical amplify-and-forward (OAF) relaying technique using erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) combined with optical hard-limiter (OHL) is introduced. The use of OHL enables EDFA-based OAF relaying FSO systems to prevent the accumulation of amplified background noise, which significantly degrades the system performance, when deploying multiple relays. For performance evaluation, we theoretically analyze the proposed system over atmospheric turbulence channels modeled by Gamma-Gamma distribution. A closed-form expression for the end-to-end BER bounds is, therefore, analytically formulated, taking into account other impacts of atmospheric channels, including atmospheric attenuation and geometric spreading of the optical beam, as well as noises caused by the background light and receiver. The numerical results, which are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations, confirm the superiority of the proposed system in comparison with the conventional ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1, 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185333/","volume":"33","issue":"19","htmlLink":"/document/7185333/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15430430","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct.1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Relaying FSO Systems Using EDFA Combined With Optical Hard-Limiter Over Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development NAFOSTED","grantNumber":"102.02-2013.02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Relaying FSO Systems Using EDFA Combined With Optical Hard-Limiter Over Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","sourcePdf":"jlt-trinh-2466432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088799S","chronDate":"Oct.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7225204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7225204","articleId":"7185333","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7185334,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Rezania","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Rezania","id":"37085453472"},{"name":"John C.

Unfortunately, these power generation patterns are mostly intermittent in nature and distributed over the electrical grid, which creates challenging problems in the reliability of the smart grid. Thus, the smart grid has a strong requisite for an efficient communication infrastructure to facilitate estimating the DER states. In contrast to the traditional methods of centralized state estimation (SE), we propose a distributed approach to microgrid SE based on the concatenated coding structure. In this framework, the DER state is treated as a dynamic outer code, and the recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code is seen as a concatenated inner code for protection and redundancy in the system states. Furthermore, in order to properly monitor the intermittent energy source from any place, this paper proposes a distributed SE method. Particularly, the outputs of the local SE are treated as measurements, which are fed into the master fusion station. At the end, the global SE can be obtained by combining local SEs with corresponding weighting factors. The weighting factors can be calculated by inspiring the covariance intersection method. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to estimate the system state properly.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2467168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2467168","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07185341.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed State Estimation Using RSC Coded Smart Grid Communications","topic":"Smart Grids: A Hub of Interdisciplinary Research","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed State Estimation Using RSC Coded Smart Grid Communications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2015","volume":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185341/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15406005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185341/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Distributed State Estimation Using RSC Coded Smart Grid Communications","sourcePdf":"access-rana-2467168-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113131S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Smart Grids: A Hub of Interdisciplinary Research"],"articleId":"7185341","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7185346,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Hong Lai","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7287836/7185346/zhlai-2466466-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Hong Lai was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

The locations of the base stations (BSs) in both tiers are modeled by spatial Poisson point processes (PPPs). The EE of the system in b/J/Hz is obtained for different antenna configurations under various diversity schemes. Adaptive modulation is employed to maximize both the throughput and the EE across both tiers. Borrowing well established tools from stochastic geometry, we obtain closed-form expressions for the coverage, throughput, and power consumption for a two tier rate adaptive cellular network. Building on the developed analytical framework, we formulate the resource allocation problem for each diversity scheme with the aim of maximizing the network-wide EE while satisfying a minimum QoS in each tier. We consider that both the number of antennas and the spectrum allocated to each tier constitute the network resource which must be efficiently selected for both tiers to maximize network-wide performance. The best performance in terms of the EE is provided by the schemes which strike a good balance between the achievable maximum throughput and the consumed power (both increasing with the number of RF chains used). In addition, the potential savings in EE by using femto-cells with sleeping mode capabilities are analyzed. It is observed that, when the density of active co-channel femto-cells exceeds a certain threshold, the EE of the system can be significantly improved by sleep scheduling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Two-Tier MIMO Diversity Schemes in Poisson Cellular Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07185349.pdf","startPage":"3898","endPage":"3911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Two-Tier MIMO Diversity Schemes in Poisson Cellular Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7185349/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524625","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Secretaria de Educacion Publica"},{"fundingName":"Mexican government"},{"fundingName":"CONACYT"},{"fundingName":"Mexico and US Army Research Lab","grantNumber":"W911NF-13-1-0216"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Two-Tier MIMO Diversity Schemes in Poisson Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hernandezaquino-2466534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095442S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7185349","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185350,"authors":[{"name":"Emroz Khan","affiliation":["Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/7412788/7185350/khan-small.gif","p":["Emroz Khan was born in Bangladesh in 1992.

Methods: In this paper, we present a novel signal processing framework which utilizes two channel PPG signals and estimates HR in two stages. The first stage eliminates any chances of a runaway error by resorting to an absolute criterion condition based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition. This stage enables the algorithm to depend very little on the previously estimated HR values and to discard the need of an initial resting phase. The second stage, on the other hand, increases the algorithm's robustness against offtrack errors by using recursive least squares filters complemented with an additional novel technique, namely time-domain extraction. Results: Using this framework, an average absolute error of 1.02 beat per minute (BPM) and standard deviation of 1.79 BPM are recorded for 12 subjects performing a run with peak velocities reaching as high as 15 km/h. Conclusion: The performance of this algorithm is found to be better than the other recently reported algorithms in this field such as TROIKA and JOSS. Significance: This method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently available wearable gadgets in HR computation during various physical activities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","volume":"63","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15802419","pubMedId":"26276979","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7185350/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Heart Rate Monitoring Scheme Using Photoplethysmographic Signals Corrupted by Intense Motion Artifacts","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Heart Rate Monitoring Scheme Using Photoplethysmographic Signals Corrupted by Intense Motion Artifacts","sourcePdf":"tbme-hasan-2466075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204578S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7412788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7412788","articleId":"7185350","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7185354,"authors":[{"name":"Mahboubeh Mandehgar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Mahboubeh","lastName":"Mandehgar","id":"37888725300"},{"name":"Daniel R.

Even though conventional single-input single-output (SISO) CTxn is operated at a negative signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR), where interference power is the same as the desired signal power, a critical drawback of SISO CTxn is that the maximum achievable spectral efficiency is less than 1 bit/s/Hz. Applying a MIMO technique to the conventional SISO CTxn provides a very efficient way to support high-date-rate service for delivering local contents, even at a negative SINR. Simulation results show that MIMO CTxn outperforms SISO CTxn while supporting high-order modulation and a high code rate. For instance, 16-QAM code rate 1/3 MIMO CTxn outperforms 4-QAM code rate 1/3 SISO CTxn from the SINR point of view. Further, the performance of MIMO CTxn is invariant with respect to the power imbalance and the difference between the received signal strengths. This makes the coverage planning much easy because all the other regions operate well without any loss of data rate if the coverage is planned with respect to the worst case.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2461092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2461092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7337347/07185362.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Cloud Transmission Based on BICM-ID for High Data Rate Local Contents Delivery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Cloud Transmission Based on BICM-ID for High Data Rate Local Contents Delivery","volume":"61","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185362/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660685","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185362/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT Research and Development Program of MSIP/IITP, Korea, \u201cDevelopment of Service and Transmission Technology for Convergent Realistic Broadcast\u201d","grantNumber":"R0101-15-294"},{"fundingName":"MSIP, Korea, under the ITRC Support Program IITP-2015-H8501-15-1001 supervised by the IITP"},{"fundingName":"ICT Research and Development Program of MSIP/IITP \u201cA Study on Next Generation Interactive Terrestrial Broadcasting System\u201d","grantNumber":"1391202006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Cloud Transmission Based on BICM-ID for High Data Rate Local Contents Delivery","sourcePdf":"tbc-jeon-2461092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090967S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7185362","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7185366,"authors":[{"name":"Kang An","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"An","id":"37070395500"},{"name":"Min Lin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536561400"},{"name":"Tao Liang","affiliation":["Nanjing Telecommunication Technology Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085341788"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7185366","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":957},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Fading","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel capacity","multi-access systems","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)","satellite communication","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay networks","opportunistic scheduling","multiuser amplify-and-forward hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network","multiuser scheduling","amplify-and-forward"]},{"kwd":["Hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network","multiuser scheduling","amplify-and-forward"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the performance of a multiuser amplify-and-forward (AF) hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network (HSTRN) with opportunistic scheduling.

The upper bound relies on a dual formula for channel capacity and on the assumption that the users can cooperate perfectly. The lower bound is derived assuming a noncooperative scenario where each user employs unitary space-time modulation (independently from the other users). Numerical results show that the gap between the upper and the lower bound is small already at moderate SNR values. This suggests that the sum-rate capacity gains obtainable through user cooperation are minimal for the scenarios considered in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07185371.pdf","startPage":"3621","endPage":"3632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-SNR Bounds on the Sum-Rate Capacity of Rayleigh Block-Fading Multiple-Access Channels With No A Priori CSI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Upper bound","Coherence","Random variables","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cooperative communication","modulation","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-SNR bounds","sum-rate capacity","Rayleigh block-fading multiple-access channels","multiuser channels","user cooperation","lower bound","upper bound","unitary space-time modulation","noncooperative scenario","channel capacity"]},{"kwd":["Channel capacity","channel state information","multiuser channels","time-varying channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Finite-SNR Bounds on the Sum-Rate Capacity of Rayleigh Block-Fading Multiple-Access Channels With No A Priori CSI","volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7185371/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524657","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council","grantNumber":"2012-4571"},{"fundingName":"German Research Society (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)","grantNumber":"Li 659/13-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-SNR Bounds on the Sum-Rate Capacity of Rayleigh Block-Fading Multiple-Access Channels With No A Priori CSI","sourcePdf":"tcomm-durisi-2466536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093632S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7185371","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185372,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085681073"},{"name":"Yun Yi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Yi","id":"37289047300"},{"name":"Yan-Tao Duan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan-Tao","lastName":"Duan","id":"37409266700"},{"name":"Zheng Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37070739500"},{"name":"Bin Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085447319"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7185372","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents a new iterative algorithm for efficient 3-D Laguerre-based finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

The channel is assumed to vary in a linear fashion within a frame. The error power transfer is investigated in parallel with the equalizing process, showing the gain in iterations and aiding the MMSE decision. Iteratively, the ICI components are estimated and canceled from the receive symbol, providing an MMSE estimate of the source symbol with an increasing reliability. It is shown that based on the error power transfer analyzed in this paper, ICI components can be significantly removed via the iterative MMSE-DFE, leaving the error composed of noise and negligible residue of ICI.

Unlike previous works which were focused on stationary platforms, we consider explicitly the effects of platform motion, which exacerbate the location-induced clutter non-homogeneity inherent in such systems and thus make the problem significantly more challenging. Two new detectors are proposed. The first is a sparsity based detector which, by exploiting a sparse representation of the clutter in the Doppler domain, adaptively estimates from the test signal the clutter subspace, which is in general distinct for different transmit/receive pairs and, moreover, may spread over the entire Doppler bandwidth. The second is a fully adaptive parametric detector which employs a parametric autoregressive clutter model and offers joint model order selection, clutter estimation/mitigation, and target detection in an integrated and fully adaptive process. Both detectors are developed within the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) framework, obviating the need for training signals that are indispensable for conventional detectors but are difficult to obtain in practice due to clutter non-homogeneity. Numerical results indicate that the proposed training-free detectors offer improved detection performance over covariance matrix based detectors when the latter have a moderate amount of training signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving Target Detection in Distributed MIMO Radar on Moving Platforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2467355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07185379.pdf","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2467355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Moving Target Detection in Distributed MIMO Radar on Moving Platforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7185379/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676857","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving Target Detection in Distributed MIMO Radar on Moving Platforms","sourcePdf":"jstsp-li-2467355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117238S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7185379","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185380,"authors":[{"name":"Ay\u015fe \u00dcnsal","affiliation":["Department of Mobile Communications, EURECOM, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7185380/unsal-2466547_print-small.gif","p":["\nAy\u015fe \u00dcnsal received the B.Sc. degree in Statistics from Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey in 2007.

A new lower-bound is presented on the reconstruction error of a common vector imperfectly measured by a network of sensors. The noisy correlated observations of the source vector are transmitted with finite energy to a single receiver via an additive white Gaussian noise asynchronous multiple-access channel (MAC). Transmission makes use of a perfect causal feedback link to the encoder connected to each sensor. Asymptotic upper-bounds on the distortion are provided for a retransmission protocol which is inspired by the classical scheme of Yamamoto and Itoh and extended to a more general network scenario. Additionally, we introduce lower-bounds on the reconstruction error for individual estimators of the noisy observations themselves. Both the upper and lower-bounds show that collaboration can be achieved through energy accumulation under certain circumstances. To investigate the practical performance of the proposed protocol we provide a numerical evaluation of the upper-bounds in the non-asymptotic energy regime using low-order quantization in the sensors. It is shown that an increase in the size of the network brings benefit in terms of performance, but that the gain in terms of energy efficiency diminishes quickly at finite energies due to a non-coherent combining loss.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2466547","startPage":"3813","endPage":"3828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07185380.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Sensing and Transmission of Sporadic Random Samples Over a Multiple-Access Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Sensing and Transmission of Sporadic Random Samples Over a Multiple-Access Channel","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","volume":"63","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185380/","accessionNumber":"15524628","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185380/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Sensing and Transmission of Sporadic Random Samples Over a Multiple-Access Channel","sourcePdf":"tcomm-unsal-2466547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093344S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7185380","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7185382,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan Sharaga","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7327073/7185382/7185382-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nathan Sharaga was born in Israel, 1986.

CS has been widely used to optimize the measurement process of bandwidth and power constrained systems like wireless body sensor network. The central issues with CS are the construction of measurement matrix and the development of recovery algorithm. In this paper, we propose a simple deterministic measurement matrix that facilitates the hardware implementation. To control the sparsity level of the signals, we apply a thresholding approach in the discrete cosine transform domain. We propose a fast and simple recovery algorithm that performs the proposed thresholding approach. We validate the proposed method by compressing and recovering electrocardiogram and electromyogram signals. We implement the proposed measurement matrix in a MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad development board. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed measurement matrix has a better performance in terms of reconstruction quality compared with random matrices.

Finally, the monitoring results of all of the subsets are combined through Bayesian inference. The proposed method reduces redundancy and complexity, explores numerous local behaviors, and provides accurate description of faults, thus improving monitoring performance significantly.

Conventional methods often study these two steps separately, e.g., learning hash functions from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile, the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in the most previous methods, neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. In particular, we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples, each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples, we maximize the margin between the matched pairs and the mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition, a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e., images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion, where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted, so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification in surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes well preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2467315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","startPage":"4766","endPage":"4779","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07185403.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Scalable Deep Hashing With Regularized Similarity Learning for Image Retrieval and Person Re-Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7185403/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bit-Scalable Deep Hashing With Regularized Similarity Learning for Image Retrieval and Person Re-Identification","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15457325","pubMedId":"26276992","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"12","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Scholar Program"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"S2013050014548 and 2014A030313201"},{"fundingName":"Program of Guangzhou Zhujiang Star of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2013J2200067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Scalable Deep Hashing With Regularized Similarity Learning for Image Retrieval and Person Re-Identification","sourcePdf":"tip-lin-2467315-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097979S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"320","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7185403","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7185410,"authors":[{"name":"Leqi Zhang","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium","Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7272173/7185410/zhang-2461656-small.gif","p":["Leqi Zhang (S\u201912) received the B.E. degree in microelectronics from East China Normal University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, and the master\u2019s degree in nanoscience and nanotechnology from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), Leuven, Belgium, in 2011.

Finally, different reported TS selectors are evaluated, and the improvement directions are suggested.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2461656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7272173/07185410.pdf","startPage":"3250","endPage":"3257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2461656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-Selector One-Resistor Cross-Point Array With Threshold Switching Selector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"One-Selector One-Resistor Cross-Point Array With Threshold Switching Selector","volume":"62","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15457252","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185410/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185410/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"imec\u2019s Core Partner Industrial Affiliation Program on RRAM."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-Selector One-Resistor Cross-Point Array With Threshold Switching Selector","sourcePdf":"ted-zhang-2461656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07494S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7272173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7272173","articleId":"7185410","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7185420,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7185420/niu-2466656-small.gif","p":["\n\nYong Niu received the B.E. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, \nBeijing, China, in 2011.

MmWave communications in the 60-GHz band are able to utilize the huge unlicensed bandwidth to provide multiple Gb/s transmission rates. In this case, device-to-device (D2D) communications in mmWave bands should be fully exploited because there is no interference with the macrocell networks and higher achievable transmission rates. In addition, because there is less interference by directional transmission, multiple links including D2D links can be scheduled for concurrent transmissions (spatial reuse). With the popularity of content-based mobile applications, popular content downloading in the small cells needs to be optimized to improve network performance and enhance user experience. In this paper, we develop an efficient scheduling scheme for popular content downloading in mmWave small cells called popular content downloading scheduling (PCDS), where both D2D communications in close proximity and concurrent transmissions are exploited to improve transmission efficiency. In PCDS, a transmission path selection algorithm is designed to establish multihop transmission paths for users, aiming at better utilization of D2D communications and concurrent transmissions. After transmission path selection, a concurrent transmission scheduling algorithm is designed to maximize the spatial reuse gain. Through extensive simulations under various traffic patterns, we demonstrate that PCDS achieves near-optimal performance in terms of delay and throughput, as well as superior performance, compared with other existing protocols, particularly under heavy load. The impact of the maximum number of hops of transmission paths on its performance is also analyzed for a better understanding of the role of D2D communications.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2466656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07185420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2466656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","startPage":"5538","endPage":"5550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Device-to-Device Communications to Enhance Spatial Reuse for Popular Content Downloading in Directional mmWave Small Cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Device-to-Device Communications to Enhance Spatial Reuse for Popular Content Downloading in Directional mmWave Small Cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141238","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7185420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201189 and 61132002"},{"fundingName":"National High Tech (863) Projects","grantNumber":"2011AA010202"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of Tsinghua University","grantNumber":"2011Z05117 and 20121087985"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"20141081231"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Strategic Emerging Industry Development Special Funds","grantNumber":"CXZZ20120616141708264"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Device-to-Device Communications to Enhance Spatial Reuse for Popular Content Downloading in Directional mmWave Small Cells","sourcePdf":"tvt-niu-2466656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082525S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7185420","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185421,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Cao","affiliation":["IBM T.

Automated anomaly detection based on advanced machine learning techniques has been developed to combat this issue; challenges remain, though, due to the difficulty of obtaining proper ground truth for model training and evaluation. Therefore, substantial human judgment on the automated analysis results is often required to better adjust the performance of anomaly detection. Unfortunately, techniques that allow users to understand the analysis results more efficiently, to make a confident judgment about anomalies, and to explore data in their context, are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel visual analysis system, TargetVue, which detects anomalous users via an unsupervised learning model and visualizes the behaviors of suspicious users in behavior-rich context through novel visualization designs and multiple coordinated contextual views. Particularly, TargetVue incorporates three new ego-centric glyphs to visually summarize a user's behaviors which effectively present the user's communication activities, features, and social interactions. An efficient layout method is proposed to place these glyphs on a triangle grid, which captures similarities among users and facilitates comparisons of behaviors of different users. We demonstrate the power of TargetVue through its application in a social bot detection challenge using Twitter data, a case study based on email records, and an interview with expert users. Our evaluation shows that TargetVue is beneficial to the detection of users with anomalous communication behaviors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Visualization","Twitter","Electronic mail","Feature extraction","Context","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data visualisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social bot detection challenge","triangle grid","user behavior","machine learning techniques","anomaly detection","online communication system","anomalous user behavior","visual analysis system","Targetvue system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Social Media","Visual Analysis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Graphics","Humans","Internet","Social Behavior","Social Media","User-Computer Interface"]},{"kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Social Media","Visual Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185421","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467196","startPage":"280","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/7307919/07185421.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185421/","displayDocTitle":"TargetVue: Visual Analysis of Anomalous User Behaviors in Online Communication Systems","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","volume":"22","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15567958","pubMedId":"26529707","htmlLink":"/document/7185421/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TargetVue: Visual Analysis of Anomalous User Behaviors in Online Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-cao-2467196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098944S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7185421","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185423,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Zhao","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China","Chongqing SANY High-Intelligent Robots Company, Ltd., 401120, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37716670800"},{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China","College of Engineering and Science, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37287152000"},{"name":"Xiaolong Zheng","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085420882"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System, Renewable Energy Sources North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293683400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"7185423","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Target tracking","Adaptive systems","Learning systems","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","state feedback","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent tracking control","uncertain high-order nonlinear systems","unknown nonlinearities","intelligent adaptive control algorithm","adaptive backstepping","neural network approximation","output tracking performance","state-feedback controller","controller design parameter tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive backstepping","high-order nonlinear systems","neural networks"]}],"abstract":"This brief is concerned with the problem of intelligent tracking control for a class of high-order nonlinear systems with completely unknown nonlinearities.

The optimal planning takes into account various factors including the economics, reliability, and variability of renewables, network- and resource-based uncertainties, and adaptability to accommodate the prevailing operating concerns. A clustering-based method is considered for analyzing the variable data concerning the potential deployment of renewable energy in microgrids. The proposed interconnection planning methodology is applied to a six-microgrid system and the planning results are discussed. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed interconnection planning methodology will determine an optimal topology accurately and efficiently for a cluster of microgrids, and show that the proposed adaptive planning methodology can easily be applied to practical microgrid applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Interconnection Planning of Community Microgrids With Renewable Energy Sources","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2456834","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7904756/07185424.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2456834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Interconnection Planning of Community Microgrids With Renewable Energy Sources","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7185424/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16823611","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science, Technology, and Innovation Plan Strategic Technologies Program in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"12-ENE3194-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Interconnection Planning of Community Microgrids With Renewable Energy Sources","sourcePdf":"tsg-shahidehpour-2456834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085251S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7904756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"7904756","articleId":"7185424","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":7185425,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Yi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7185425/yi-small.gif","p":["Hao Yi (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree from\n the Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 2007, the M.S. and Ph.D. degree from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong\n University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","Since 2013, he has been a Member of the School of Electrical Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University.

In a C-RAN, a central unit (CU) controls a cluster of radio units (RUs) through low-latency fronthaul links. Most previous works on the design of fronthaul compression and precoding assume constant channels and instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the CU. This paper, in contrast, concentrates on a more practical scenario with block-ergodic channels and considers either instantaneous or stochastic CSI at the CU. Moreover, the analysis encompasses two types of CU-RU functional splits at the physical layer, which we refer to as compression-after-precoding (CAP) and compression-before-precoding (CBP). With the CAP approach, which is the standard C-RAN solution, all baseband processing is done at the CU. With the CBP scheme, channel encoding and precoding are instead performed at the RUs: The CU does not perform precoding but rather forwards separately the information messages of a subset of mobile stations (MSs) along with the compressed precoding matrices to each RU. Optimization algorithms over fronthaul compression and precoding for both CAP and CBP are proposed, which are based on a stochastic successive upper bound minimization (SSUM) approach. Numerical results yield insights into the optimal RU-CU functional split for C-RANs. As a general conclusion, the relative advantages of the two functional splits depend on the interplay between the enhanced interference management abilities of CAP, particularly for dense networks, and the lower fronthaul requirements of CBP in terms of precoding information overhead, particularly for large coherence periods and with stochastic, rather than instantaneous, CSI.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2466619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07185432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2466619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","startPage":"5022","endPage":"5032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fronthaul Compression and Precoding Design for C-RANs Over Ergodic Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fronthaul Compression and Precoding Design for C-RANs Over Ergodic Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141245","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7185432/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The Cross-Ministry Giga KOREA Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israeli Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"European FP7 Network of Excellence in Wireless COMmunications (NEWCOM#)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fronthaul Compression and Precoding Design for C-RANs Over Ergodic Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-kang-2466619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16674S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7185432","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185433,"authors":[{"name":"Guy Even","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Guy Even received his B.Sc. degree in 1988 in Mathematics and Computer Science from the Hebrew University.

The BP-based algorithms operate over graph representations, called factor graphs, that are used to model the input. Although in many cases, the BP-based algorithms exhibit impressive empirical results, not much has been proved when the factor graphs have cycles. This paper deals with packing and covering integer programs in which the constraint matrix is zero-one, the constraint vector is integral, and the variables are subject to box constraints. We study the performance of the min-sum algorithm when applied to the corresponding factor graph models of packing and covering linear programmings (LPs). We compare the solutions computed by the min-sum algorithm for packing and covering problems to the optimal solutions of the corresponding LP relaxations. In particular, we prove that if the LP has an optimal fractional solution, then for each fractional component, the minsum algorithm either computes multiple solutions or the solution oscillates below and above the fraction. This implies that the min-sum algorithm computes the optimal integral solution only if the LP has a unique optimal solution that is integral. The converse is not true in general. For a special case of packing and covering problems, we prove that if the LP has a unique optimal solution that is integral and on the boundary of the box constraints, then the min-sum algorithm computes the optimal solution in pseudopolynomial time. Our results unify and extend recent results for the maximum weight matching problem and for the maximum weight independent set problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7258415/07185433.pdf","startPage":"5295","endPage":"5305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2466598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2466598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Min-Sum Algorithm for Packing and Covering Problems via Linear Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Linear programming","Inference algorithms","Dynamic programming","Optimization","Bipartite graph","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","integer programming","linear programming","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["min-sum algorithm","packing problem","covering problem","integer program","linear programming","LP","message-passing algorithm","belief propagation","BP","factor graph model","maximum weight independent set problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["belief propagation (BP)","message-passing algorithms","min-sum algorithm","max-product algorithm","dynamic programming","linear programming (LP)","combinatorial optimization","packing problems","covering problems","factor graphs","graph cover"]},{"kwd":["Belief propagation (BP)","message-passing algorithms","min-sum algorithm","max-product algorithm","dynamic programming","linear programming (LP)","combinatorial optimization","packing problems","covering problems","factor graphs","graph cover"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Min-Sum Algorithm for Packing and Covering Problems via Linear Programming","volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7185433/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15439877","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Min-Sum Algorithm for Packing and Covering Problems via Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"tit-even-2466598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091531S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7258415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7258415","articleId":"7185433","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185434,"authors":[{"name":"Leimin Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control of Education, Ministry of China, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7299729/7185434/wang-2460239-small.gif","p":["Leimin Wang received the B.S. degree from the College of Mathematics and Statistics, South-Central University For Nationalities, Wuhan, China, in 2011.

However, like other higher order filters, it introduces resonance to the grid when used with a grid converter. Its stability and robustness are also affected by grid impedance variations, making its design more challenging. To address these concerns, a new parameter design method for the LLCL filter has been formulated in this paper, which when enforced, guarantees robust and stable grid current control regardless of how the grid conditions change. It is thus an enhanced method even with no damping added to the grid converter. The method has been applied to the development of an LLCL filter for testing in the laboratory with a 5-kW, 400-V, and 50-Hz grid converter. The method can also be applied to the lower order LCL filter with only a slight modification needed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2467185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2467185","startPage":"3958","endPage":"3967","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7352399/07185435.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"<i>LLCL</i>-Filtered Grid Converter With Improved Stability and Robustness","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"<i>LLCL</i>-Filtered Grid Converter With Improved Stability and Robustness","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185435/","accessionNumber":"15677458","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185435/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC)"},{"fundingName":"European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007\u20132013)/ERC","grantNumber":"321149-Harmony"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council (CSC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<italic>LLCL</italic>-Filtered Grid Converter With Improved Stability and Robustness","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2467185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097919S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7185435","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7185440,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Xin","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7185440/xin-small.gif","p":["Zhen Xin (S\u201915) was born in Shandong Province, China.

Digital implementation of this derivative term is generally a challenge with many methods presently developed for resolving it. These methods are however still facing drawbacks, which have comprehensively been explained in this paper. Two derivatives are then proposed, based on either second-order or nonideal generalized integrator. Performances of these derivatives have been found to match the ideal \u201cs\u201d function closely. Active damping based on capacitor voltage feedback can therefore be realized accurately.

We present a class of sparse matrices A, and a corresponding algorithm that we call short and fast1 (SHO-FA) that, with high probability over A, can reconstruct x from Ax. The SHO-FA algorithm is related to the invertible bloom lookup tables recently introduced by Goodrich et al., with two important distinctions- SHO-FA relies on linear measurements, and is robust to noise. The SHO-FA algorithm is the first to simultaneously have the following properties: 1) it requires only O(k) measurements; 2) the bit precision of each measurement and each arithmetic operation is O (log(n) + P) (here, 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-P</sup>\n corresponds to the desired relative error in the reconstruction of x); 3) the computational complexity of decoding is O(k) arithmetic operations and that of encoding is O(n) arithmetic operations; and 4) if the reconstruction goal is simply to recover a single component of x instead of all of x, with significant probability over A, this can be done in constant time. All the above constants are independent of all problem parameters other than the desired probability of success. For a wide range of parameters, these properties are informationtheoretically order-optimal. In addition, our SHO-FA algorithm works over fairly general ensembles of sparse random matrices, and is robust to random noise and (random) approximate sparsity for a large range of k. In particular, suppose the measured vector equals A(x + z) + e, where z and e correspond to the source tail and measurement noise, respectively. Under reasonable statistical assumptions on z and e, our decoding algorithm reconstructs x with an estimation error of O(||z||2 + ||e||2). The SHO-FA algorithm works with high probability over A, z, and e, and still requires only O(k) steps and O(k) measurements over O(log(n))-bit numbers. This is in contrast to most existing algorithms that focus on the worst case z model, where it is known that \u03a9(k log(n/k)) measurements over O(log(n))-bit numbers are necessary. Our algorithm has good empirical performance, as validated by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2466601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7748579/07185441.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2466601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748579","startPage":"7419","endPage":"7444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SHO-FA: Robust Compressive Sensing With Order-Optimal Complexity, Measurements, and Bits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SHO-FA: Robust Compressive Sensing With Order-Optimal Complexity, Measurements, and Bits","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16496042","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7185441/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University Grants Committee, Hong Kong","grantNumber":"AoE/E-02/08"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336700"},{"fundingName":"University Grants Committee, Hong Kong, through the General Research Fund, China","grantNumber":"14201014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SHO-FA: Robust Compressive Sensing With Order-Optimal Complexity, Measurements, and Bits","sourcePdf":"tit-bakshi-2466601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203446S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7748579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7748579","articleId":"7185441","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185442,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Luo","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7299729/7185442/luo-2461023-small.gif","p":["Biao Luo received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2014.","He was a Research Assistant with the Department of System Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2013.

Y is an edited version of X, where the editing involves random deletions, insertions, and substitutions, possibly in bursts. The goal is for the node with Y to reconstruct X with minimal exchange of information over a noiseless link. The communication is measured in terms of both the total number of bits exchanged and the number of interactive rounds of communication. This paper focuses on the setting where the number of edits is o(n/log n), where n is the length of X. We first consider the case where the edits are a mixture of insertions and deletions (indels), and propose an interactive synchronization algorithm with near-optimal communication rate and average computational complexity of O(n) arithmetic operations. The algorithm uses interaction to efficiently split the source sequence into substrings containing exactly one deletion or insertion. Each of these substrings is then synchronized using an optimal one-way algorithm based on the single-deletion correcting channel codes of Varshamov and Tenengolts. We then build on this synchronization algorithm in three different ways. First, it is modified to work with a single round of interaction. The reduction in the number of rounds comes at the expense of higher communication, which is quantified. Next, we present an extension to the practically important case where the insertions and deletions may occur in (potentially large) bursts. Finally, we show how to synchronize the sources to within a target Hamming distance. This feature can be used to differentiate between substitution and indel edits. In addition to theoretical performance bounds, we provide several validating simulation results for the proposed algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15452691","htmlLink":"/document/7185447/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Interactive Algorithms for Synchronization From Deletions, Insertions, and Substitutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Interactive Algorithms for Synchronization From Deletions, Insertions, and Substitutions","sourcePdf":"tit-venkataramanan-2466635-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188356S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7258415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7258415","articleId":"7185447","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185449,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control of Education Ministry of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7434135/7185449/liu-2461191-small.gif","p":["Peng Liu received the B.S. degree in information and computing science from the Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, China, and the M.S. degree in computational mathematics with Jilin University, Changchun, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Without using the mean value theorem, the difficulty of the control design for pure-feedback systems is overcome by modeling the nonaffine functions appropriately. With the help of neural network approximators, an adaptive neural controller is developed by combining the dynamic surface control (DSC) and minimal learning parameter (MLP) techniques. The key features of our approach are that, first, the restrictive assumptions on the partial derivative of nonaffine functions are removed, second, the DSC technique is used to avoid \u201cthe explosion of complexity\u201d in the backstepping design, and the number of adaptive parameters is reduced significantly using the MLP technique, third, smooth robust compensators are employed to circumvent the influences of approximation errors and disturbances.

A zero-forcing (ZF)-based relay transceiver design with semiblind gain control is presented, considering the problem of relay oscillation. The asymptotic expression of end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise power (SINR) is derived under the general power scaling scheme. The scaling behaviors of echo interference (EI) and effective channel estimation error are determined. Scaling results show that the deployment of very large antenna arrays at the relay has the potential to eliminate the effect of EI due to the full-duplex operation, if the power scaling scheme is selected properly. Moreover, based on the asymptotic analysis, a low-complexity power control scheme is proposed to optimize the spectral efficiency of AF-MM-FDR. Simulation results show that the proposed power control scheme improves the spectral-energy efficiency tradeoff of AF-MM-FDR significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07185452.pdf","startPage":"5797","endPage":"5804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2467211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2467211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Duplex Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Semiblind Gain Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Antenna arrays","Gain control","Transceivers","Channel estimation","MIMO","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","channel estimation","computational complexity","echo","MIMO communication","power control","protocols","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multiple-input-multiple-output full-duplex relaying protocol","amplify-and-forward-based full-duplex relaying protocol","spectral-energy efficiency tradeoff improvement","spectral efficiency optimization","low-complexity power control scheme","very large antenna arrays","effective channel estimation error","echo interference","general power scaling scheme","SINR","end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise power","relay oscillation problem","zero-forcing-based relay transceiver design","common full-duplex relay","multiple source-destination pairs","semiblind gain control","full-duplex massive MIMO AF relaying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic analysis","full-duplex relaying (FDR)","gain control","massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO)","power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Semiblind Gain Control","volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7185452/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141243","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major Research Plan of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91438115"},{"fundingName":"Special Financial Grant of the China Postdoctoral Science foundation","grantNumber":"2015T81079"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371123 and 61301165"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK2011002 and BK2012055"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M552612"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1401178C"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC) 2015 [15]"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Duplex Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Semiblind Gain Control","sourcePdf":"tvt-xu-2467211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128107S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7185452","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185453,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Yang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China\u2013Birmingham Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/7274528/7185453/yang-small.gif","p":["Peng Yang (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in computer science\n and technology from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2012.

However, they still suffer from a drawback that the high-quality waypoints in previous candidate paths can hardly be exploited for further evolution, since they regard all the waypoints of a path as an integrated individual. Due to this drawback, the previous planners usually fail when encountering lots of obstacles. In this paper, a new idea of separately evaluating and evolving waypoints is presented to solve this problem. Concretely, the original objective and constraint functions of UAVs path planning are decomposed into a set of new evaluation functions, with which waypoints on a path can be evaluated separately. The new evaluation functions allow waypoints on a path to be evolved separately and, thus, high-quality waypoints can be better exploited. On this basis, the waypoints are encoded in a rotated coordinate system with an external restriction and evolved with JADE, a state-of-the-art variant of the differential evolution algorithm. To test the capabilities of the new planner on planning obstacle-free paths, five scenarios with increasing numbers of obstacles are constructed. Three existing planners and four variants of the proposed planner are compared to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed planner. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed planner and the idea of separate evolution.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2015.2459812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/7274528/07185453.pdf","startPage":"1130","endPage":"1146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2015.2459812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Planning for Single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle by Separately Evolving Waypoints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Path Planning for Single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle by Separately Evolving Waypoints","volume":"31","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15484811","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185453/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185453/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2011CB707006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61175065"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12\u20130512"},{"fundingName":"Basque Government","grantNumber":"IT609-13"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO","grantNumber":"SEV-2013-0323 and TIN2013-41272P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Planning for Single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle by Separately Evolving Waypoints","sourcePdf":"tro-tang-2459812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101227S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7274528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7274528","articleId":"7185453","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7185458,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Minayi Jalil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7185458/jalil-2467177-small.gif","p":["\n\nAmir Minayi Jalil received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering \nfrom Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering \nfrom Limoges University, Limoges, France, in 2012.","From 2005 to 2008, he was with the technical department of Huawei Technologies Co.

This paper proposes the optimal solution for a joint power allocation and relay assignment (JPARA) problem subject to the sum-power constraint at the source node. This formulation is applicable to different system models. Specifically, we assume a network consisting of one source node, one destination node, and N relays, where the source node uses orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to transmit its information to the destination. Each relay should be assigned to one of the subcarriers, and the source node should distribute its power among the subcarriers. We propose an algorithm to find the JPARA solution based on the max-min criterion. The optimality of the proposed algorithm is analytically proved, and its complexity is calculated to be O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n). We show that our proposed algorithm offers significant improvement in the performance of the worst end-to-end link compared with the separate optimization case. To further improve the performance, a new approach is proposed, in which each subcarrier is assigned a predetermined initial power, and the remaining power is distributed through the proposed JPARA algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2467177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

An algebraic multigrid (AMG) scheme is executed on multiple graphic processor units (GPUs) as a preconditioner for the conjugate gradients method. The speedup is further increased by exploiting the fact that the repeated solutions of almost similar systems must be obtained in the Newton-Raphson iterations of the implicit time-stepping scheme.

Based on a Rician model for the LoS channels, we show, both analytically and numerically, that LoS interference hinders the achievable SU capacity when interference constraints are imposed at the primary user (PU) receiver. This is caused by the poor dynamic range of interference channel fluctuations when a dominant LoS component exists. To improve the capacity of such a system, we propose the use of an electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antenna at the secondary terminals. An ESPAR antenna involves a single radio frequency (RF) chain and has a reconfigurable radiation pattern that is controlled by assigning arbitrary weights to $M$ orthonormal basis radiation patterns via altering a set of reactive loads. By viewing the orthonormal patterns as multiple virtual dumb antennas, we randomly vary their weights over time, creating artificial channel fluctuations that can perfectly eliminate the undesired impact of LoS interference. This scheme is termed as random aerial beamforming (RAB) and is well suited for compact and low-cost mobile terminals as it uses a single RF chain. Moreover, we investigate the exposed-SU problem in a multiuser setting, showing that LoS interference hinders multiuser interference diversity and affects the growth rate of the SU capacity as a function of the number of users. Using RAB, we show that LoS interference can, in fact, be exploited to improve multiuser diversity by boosting the effective number of users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","volume":"65","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"16141163","publicationDate":"July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185460/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Random Aerial Beamforming for Underlay Cognitive Radio With Exposed Secondary Users","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Aerial Beamforming for Underlay Cognitive Radio With Exposed Secondary Users","sourcePdf":"tvt-alaa-2466636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143593S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7185460","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7185461,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoxi Fang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7185461/fang-2467180-small.gif","p":["Zhaoxi Fang (M'15) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","Since June 2009, he has been with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, China, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Both the BS and the RS are equipped with a very large-scale antenna array, whereas each MS is equipped with a small number of antennas. We investigate two zero-forcing (ZF)-based nonregenerative relaying schemes for cTWRCs, namely, signal-alignment-based ZF (SA-ZF) and antenna-selection-based ZF (AS-ZF). We focus on analyzing the impact of large antenna arrays on the performance of these low-complexity nonregenerative relaying protocols, and we derive closed-form asymptotic expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the achievable sum rate when the numbers of antennas at the BS and the RS go large simultaneously. We show that with large-scale antenna arrays, ZF-based relaying can achieve the sum-rate capacity of the cTWRC, either when the RS is located much closer to the BS than to the MSs or when the number of antennas at the BS far exceeds that at the RS. We further show that, with large-scale antenna arrays, the transmit power of the BS and each MS can be made inversely proportional to the number of relay antennas while maintaining a given achievable rate for each end node. Numerical results are provided to verify our analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonregenerative Cellular Two-Way Relaying With Large-Scale Antenna Arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2467180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07185461.pdf","startPage":"4959","endPage":"4972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2467180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"Nonregenerative Cellular Two-Way Relaying With Large-Scale Antenna Arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7185461/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141180","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Recruitment Program of Global Young Experts"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401400 and 61471241"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonregenerative Cellular Two-Way Relaying With Large-Scale Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tvt-fang-2467180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097218S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7185461","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7185467,"authors":[{"name":"Harish Kundur Subramaniyan","affiliation":["University of Twente, IC-Design Group, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7185467/7185467-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Harish Kundur Subramaniyan (S\u201914) was born in Chennai, India, in 1976.

Unfortunately, the linearity of CMOS inverters, which are often used to implement V-I conversion, is highly sensitive to Process, Voltage and Temperature variations. This paper proposes a more robust technique based on resistive degeneration. To mitigate third-order IM3 distortion induced by the quadratic MOSFET I-V characteristic, a new linearization technique is proposed which exploits a floating battery by-pass circuit and replica biasing to improve IIP3 in a robust way. This paper explains the concept and analyzes linearity improvement. To demonstrate operation, an LNTA with current domain mixer is implemented in a 45 nm CMOS process. Compared to a conventional inverter based LNTA with the same transconductance, it improves IIP3 from 2 dBm to a robust P IIP3 of 8 dBm at the cost of 67% increase in power consumption.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Inverters","MOSFET","Linearity","Receivers","Batteries","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","invertors","linearisation techniques","MOSFET","operational amplifiers","radio receivers","radiofrequency amplifiers","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF transconductor linearization","software defined radio receivers","RF V-I conversion","RF voltage gain","CMOS inverters","resistive degeneration","third-order IM3 distortion","quadratic MOSFET","linearization technique","floating battery","LNTA","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","cognitive radio receiver","figure-of-merit","IIP3","linearity","linearization","multi-band receiver","negative feedback","process voltage temperature (PVT) variations","receiver","reconfigurable receiver","robust circuit design","SAW-less receiver","software-defined receiver","software-defined radio","transconductor","wideband receiver"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2453964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7307914/07185467.pdf","startPage":"2591","endPage":"2602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2453964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF Transconductor Linearization Robust to Process, Voltage and Temperature Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RF Transconductor Linearization Robust to Process, Voltage and Temperature Variations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185467/","volume":"50","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185467/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15557942","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Transconductor Linearization Robust to Process, Voltage and Temperature Variations","sourcePdf":"jssc-kundursubramaniyan-2453964-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071744S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7307914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7307914","articleId":"7185467","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7185468,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Wen Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7185468/liang-2467394-small.gif","p":["Han-Wen Liang received the B.Sc. degree in power mechanical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical control engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2010.

For the scenario where transmitter is with limited processing capability and limited power such as Internet Of Things (IOT) and wireless sensor network (WSN), SSK is preferable to typical MIMO due to its simplicity and improved energy efficiency. The proposed CKMC blind communication trades off receiver complexity for training overhead, which provides better spectral efficiency compared to training-based transceiver. In CKMC, the blind communication problem is converted to the problems of clustering and permutation; for the clustering problem, we propose K-means clustering (KMC) detector to reduce detection complexity; for the permutation problem, we propose to perform depermutation with the aid of channel decoding. The analysis of CKMC blind transceiver is conducted, and the verification of performance of CKMC is presented in the simulations section. The results show that the performance of CKMC blind communication can closely approach the performance of optimal receiver with perfect CSI under certain scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2467394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07185468.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2467394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding-Aided K-Means Clustering Blind Transceiver for Space Shift Keying MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Coding-Aided K-Means Clustering Blind Transceiver for Space Shift Keying MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185468/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697407","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185468/","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"102-2221-E-002-136-MY3 and 102-2221-E-001-006-MY2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001869","fundingName":"Academia Sinica Thematic","grantNumber":"AS-104-TP-A05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding-Aided K-Means Clustering Blind Transceiver for Space Shift Keying MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-chung-2467394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112808S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7185468","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7185470,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Tsilimantos","affiliation":["CITI-INRIA, INRIA, University of Lyon, Villeurbanne, France","Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab, France Research Center, Huawei Technologies, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7185470/tsili-2466541-small.gif","p":["Dimitrios Tsilimantos received the Dipl.

The proposed theoretical framework is based on an optimal radio resource allocation of transmit power and bandwidth for the downlink direction, applicable for an orthogonal cellular network. The analysis is initially focused on a single cell scenario, for which in addition to the solution of the main SE-EE optimization problem, it is proved that a traffic repartition scheme can also be adopted as a way to simplify this approach. By exploiting this interesting result along with properties of stochastic geometry, this work is extended to a more challenging multicell environment, where interference is shown to play an essential role and for this reason several interference reduction techniques are investigated. Special attention is also given to the case of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a way to evaluate the upper bound on EE in this regime is provided. This methodology leads to tractable analytical results under certain common channel properties, and thus allows the study of various models without the need for demanding system-level simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2466541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07185470.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2466541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral and Energy Efficiency Trade-offs in Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185470/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral and Energy Efficiency Trade-offs in Cellular Networks","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697410","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7185470/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Common Research Laboratory between INRIA and Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs"},{"fundingName":"GreenTouch"},{"fundingName":"CMIRA 13 006396 01 Explora Pro"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.

A common complication for such postdisaster ad hoc communication is how to efficiently control the forwarding behaviors of relay nodes so as to save their energy consumption and buffer usage while simultaneously guaranteeing the desired delivery performance. Different from previous studies, we consider in this paper an explicit probabilistic stopping mechanism, where a relay node that is actively disseminating a message will stop spreading the message with a certain probability, after meeting another node having already received the message. Besides developing a two-dimensional Markov chain framework to characterize the message propagation process, we also derive the average time required for completion of message propagation, the probability distribution, the expectation, the variance of the fraction of nodes finally receiving the message, etc. Our results reveal that the explicit probabilistic stopping mechanism is very desirable for postdisaster communication, even being able to guarantee a majority of nodes in final message reception. What is more, the developed framework provides us a deeper understanding on how network parameters may affect these important performance metrics, which further enables network designers to accordingly tune controllable parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07185474.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2466621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2466621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markovian Analysis for Explicit Probabilistic Stopping-Based Information Propagation in Postdisaster Ad Hoc Mobile Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Relays","Transient analysis","Measurement","Probabilistic logic","Mobile communication","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emergency management","energy consumption","Markov processes","mobile ad hoc networks","relay networks (telecommunication)","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["explicit probabilistic stopping-based information propagation","postdisaster ad hoc mobile networks","mobile phones","relay nodes","energy consumption","buffer usage","two-dimensional Markov chain framework","message propagation process","probability distribution","postdisaster communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc mobile networks","Markov chain","probabilistic stopping","delivery performance","information propagation","post-disaster networks"]},{"kwd":["Ad hoc mobile networks","Markov chain","probabilistic stopping","delivery performance","information propagation","post-disaster networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Markovian Analysis for Explicit Probabilistic Stopping-Based Information Propagation in Postdisaster Ad Hoc Mobile Networks","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7185474/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697406","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372073, 61373043, 61202394, 61472367 and 61432015"},{"fundingName":"Key Program of NSFC-Guangdong Union Foundation","grantNumber":"U1135002"},{"fundingName":"IEEE MASS 2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markovian Analysis for Explicit Probabilistic Stopping-Based Information Propagation in Postdisaster Ad Hoc Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2466621-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084697S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7185474","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7185477,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hunghom, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/7247780/7185477/7185477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2013.

Based on Kirchhoff's laws and the properties of network elements, and combining with a complex network structure, we propose a model that generates power flow information given the electricity consumption and generation information. It has been widely known that large scale blackouts are the result of a series of cascading failures triggered by the malfunctioning of specific critical components. Power systems could be more robust if there were fewer such critical components or the network configuration was suitably designed. The percentage of unserved nodes (PUN) caused by a failed component and the percentage of noncritical links (PNL) that will not cause severe damage are used to provide quantitative indication of a power system's robustness. We assess robustness of the IEEE 118 Bus, Northern European Grid and some synthesized networks. The influence of network structure and location of generators are explored. Simulation results show that the connection with short average shortest path length can significantly reduce a power system's robustness, and that the system with lower generator resistance has better robustness with a given network structure. We also propose a new metric based on node-generator distance (DG) for measuring the accessibility of generators in a power network which is shown to affect robustness significantly.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2462152","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/07185477.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2462152","startPage":"456","endPage":"464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/7247780/07185477.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of Robustness of Power Systems From a Network Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of Robustness of Power Systems From a Network Perspective","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15433137","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7185477/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of Robustness of Power Systems From a Network Perspective","sourcePdf":"jetcas-zhang-2462152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082536S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7247780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7247780","articleId":"7185477","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7185478,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Friesicke","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Hamburg-Harburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Friesicke","id":"38570794900"},{"name":"R\u00fcdiger Quay","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid-State Physics (IAF), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"R\u00fcdiger","lastName":"Quay","id":"37298946700"},{"name":"Arne F.

A risk-limiting economic dispatch scheme provides the means to optimize the dispatch and provision of these products. In this paper, we adopt the extended loss-of-load probability as the definition of risk. We first assess how the new products distort the optimal economic dispatch by comparing to the case without such products. Specifically, using parametric analysis, we establish the relationship between the minimal generation cost and the two key parameters of the new products: the up- and down-flexible ramping requirements. Such relationship yields a novel routine to efficiently solve the non-convex risk-limiting economic dispatch problem. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results suggest that our approach may substantially reduce the cost for incorporating the new products. We believe our approach can assist the ISOs with utilizing the ramping capacities in the system at the minimal cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7453237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2460748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7453237/07185479.pdf","startPage":"1990","endPage":"2003","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2460748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk-Limiting Economic Dispatch for Electricity Markets With Flexible Ramping Products","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"Risk-Limiting Economic Dispatch for Electricity Markets With Flexible Ramping Products","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7185479/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935136","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7185479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk-Limiting Economic Dispatch for Electricity Markets With Flexible Ramping Products","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wu-2460748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075886S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7453237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7453237","articleId":"7185479","onlineDate":"11 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7188525,"authors":[{"name":"Dake Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Dake","lastName":"Liu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7188525","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","OFDM","Program processors","Receivers","Forward error correction","Payloads","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","application specific integrated circuits","instruction sets","matrix algebra","parallel processing","power consumption","software radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baseband ASIP design","SDR","R&D","4G","3G mobile handset","WLAN","power consumption","heterogeneous symbol processor","DFE","FFE","matrix symbol","bit parallel processor","baseband processor","UDN","5G","wireless local area network","digital front end","application specific instruction-set processor","software defined radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["baseband ASIP","architecture selection","SDR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7188525","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7188525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7188525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7188515","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7188515/07188525.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Baseband ASIP design for SDR","abstract":"Baseband ASIP designs for handsets are discussed based on the author's R&D backgrounds.
