For verification, the proposed APD with three-branch nonlinear paths is implemented with a 30-W class-AB PA and tested using two-tone and various wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) signals at 2.14 GHz.

The transfer function from the applied actuator voltage to the measured load force exhibits a zero-pole ordering that greatly simplifies the design and implementation of a tracking and damping controller. Exceptional tracking and damping performance can be achieved with a simple integral controller. Other outstanding characteristics include guaranteed stability and insensitivity to changes in resonance frequency. Experimental results on a high-speed nanopositioner demonstrate an increase in the closed-loop bandwidth from 210 Hz (with an integral controller) to 2.07 kHz (with a force-feedback control). Gain margin is simultaneously improved from 5 dB to infinity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nanopositioning","Force feedback","Vibration control","Damping","Force control","Actuators","Force measurement","Transfer functions","Voltage measurement","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","closed loop systems","force feedback","poles and zeros","stability","tracking","transfer functions","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanopositioning system","high-performance tracking","vibration control","actuator load force","nanopositioning stage","transfer function","actuator voltage","zero-pole ordering","damping controller","tracking controller","resonance frequency","integral controller","closed-loop bandwidth","force-feedback control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mechatronics","piezoelectric transducers","position control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2028422","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5441215/05290033.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2028422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanopositioning System With Force Feedback for High-Performance Tracking and Vibration Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nanopositioning System With Force Feedback for High-Performance Tracking and Vibration Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290033/","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290033/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11208162","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanopositioning System With Force Feedback for High-Performance Tracking and Vibration Control","sourcePdf":"tmech-fleming-2028422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145307S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5441215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"5441215","articleId":"5290033","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290035,"authors":[{"name":"Hynek Boril","affiliation":["Center of Robust Speech Systems (CRSS), University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5508665/5290035/5290035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hynek Bo\u0159il (S'08\u2013M'09) was born in Most, Czech Republic.

The noise-induced speech adjustments, called Lombard effect (LE), are known to severely impact the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The reduced performance results from the mismatch between the ASR acoustic models trained typically on noise-clean neutral (modal) speech and the actual parameters of noisy LE speech. In this study, novel unsupervised frequency domain and cepstral domain equalizations that increase ASR resistance to LE are proposed and incorporated in a recognition scheme employing a codebook of noisy acoustic models. In the frequency domain, short-time speech spectra are transformed towards neutral ASR acoustic models in a maximum-likelihood fashion. Simultaneously, dynamics of cepstral samples are determined from the quantile estimates and normalized to a constant range. A codebook decoding strategy is applied to determine the noisy models best matching the actual mixture of speech and noisy background. The proposed algorithms are evaluated side by side with conventional compensation schemes on connected Czech digits presented in various levels of background car noise. The resulting system provides an absolute word error rate (WER) reduction on 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio data of 8.7% and 37.7% for female neutral and LE speech, respectively, and of 8.7% and 32.8% for male neutral and LE speech, respectively, when compared to the baseline recognizer employing perceptual linear prediction (PLP) coefficients and cepstral mean and variance normalization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473530","htmlLink":"/document/5290035/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Equalization of Lombard Effect for Speech Recognition in Noisy Adverse Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Equalization of Lombard Effect for Speech Recognition in Noisy Adverse Environments","sourcePdf":"tasl-hansen-2034770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106944S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5508665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5508665","articleId":"5290035","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290048,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Tao Duan","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan-Tao","lastName":"Duan","id":"37409266700"},{"name":"Bin Chen","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292996400"},{"name":"Yun Yi","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Yi","id":"37289047300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5290048","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Sparse matrices","Polynomials","Two dimensional displays","Maxwell equations","Laboratories","Matrix decomposition","Time factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","matrix decomposition","Maxwell equations","polynomials","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconditionally stable 2-D WLP-FDTD method","weighted Laguerre polynomial","finite-difference time-domain method","sparse matrix equation","factorization-splitting scheme","CPU time","memory storage","numerical example","Maxwell equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","Laguerre polynomials","unconditionally stable method"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents an efficient algorithm for the unconditionally stable two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method with weighted Laguerre polynomials (2-D WLP-FDTD).

This is akin to a Slepian-Wolf setup, but in the sampling rather than the lossless compression case. Two different scenarios are considered: In the case of universal reconstruction, we look for a sensing and recovery mechanism that works for all possible signals, whereas in what we call almost sure reconstruction, we allow to have a small set (with measure zero) of unrecoverable signals. We derive achievability bounds on the number of samples needed for both scenarios. Our results show that, only in the almost sure setup can we effectively exploit the signal correlations to achieve effective gains in sampling efficiency. In addition to the above theoretical analysis, we propose an efficient and robust distributed sampling and reconstruction algorithm based on annihilating filters. We evaluate the performance of our method in one synthetic scenario, and two practical applications, including the distributed audio sampling in binaural hearing aids and the efficient estimation of room impulse responses. The numerical results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in both synthetic and practical setups.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290053/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105853","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Sampling of Signals Linked by Sparse Filtering: Theory and Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Sampling of Signals Linked by Sparse Filtering: Theory and Applications","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-ahormati-2034908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091436S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5290053","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290056,"authors":[{"name":"Wing-Kin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5427215/5290056/5290056-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wing-Kin Ma (S'96\u2013M'01) received the B.Eng.

Such signals are generally called quasi-stationary or locally stationary signals. This paper considers the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of quasi-stationary signals. Specifically, in our problem formulation we assume: i) sensor array of uniform linear structure; ii) mutually uncorrelated wide-sense quasi-stationary source signals; and iii) wide-sense stationary noise process with unknown, possibly nonwhite, spatial covariance. Under the assumptions above and by judiciously examining the structures of local second-order statistics (SOSs), we develop a Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace approach that has two notable advantages. First, through an identifiability analysis, it is proven that this KR subspace approach can operate even when the number of sensors is about half of the number of sources. The idea behind is to make use of a \u00bfvirtual\u00bf array structure provided inherently in the local SOS model, of which the degree of freedom is about twice of that of the physical array. Second, the KR formulation naturally provides a simple yet effective way of eliminating the unknown spatial noise covariance from the signal SOSs. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the KR subspace approach under various situations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2034935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2034935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5427215/05290056.pdf","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA Estimation of Quasi-Stationary Signals With Less Sensors Than Sources and Unknown Spatial Noise Covariance: A Khatri\u2013Rao Subspace Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"DOA Estimation of Quasi-Stationary Signals With Less Sensors Than Sources and Unknown Spatial Noise Covariance: A Khatri\u2013Rao Subspace Approach","volume":"58","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290056/","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168865","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290056/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA Estimation of Quasi-Stationary Signals With Less Sensors Than Sources and Unknown Spatial Noise Covariance: A Khatri\u2013Rao Subspace Approach","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-wma-2034935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118335S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5427215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"5427215","articleId":"5290056","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5290058,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Vehicle privacy is provided as long as a vehicle does not attempt to endorse the same message more than once. In spite of a message having been validly endorsed, if it is later found to be false, the system offers the possibility of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i>\n tracing the message generator and its endorsers.

In this paper, we propose a new scheme for sampling and reconstructing of a multiband sparse signals that occupy a small part of a given broad frequency range under the constraint of a small number of sampling channels.

The scheme, which we call synchronous multirate sampling (SMRS), entails gathering samples synchronously at few different rates whose sum is significantly lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. The signals are reconstructed by finding a solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations by applying a pursuit algorithm and assuming that the solution is composed of a minimum number of bands. The empirical reconstruction success rate is higher than obtained using previously published multicoset scheme when the number of sampling channels is small and the conditions for a perfect reconstruction in the multicoset scheme are not fulfilled. The practical sampling system which is simulated in our work consists of three sampling channels. Our simulation results show that a very high empirical success rate is obtained when the total sampling rate is five times higher than the total signal support of a complex signal with four bands. By comparison, a multicoset sampling scheme obtains a very high empirical success rate with a total sampling rate which is three times higher than the total signal support. However, the multicoset scheme requires 14 channels.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2034906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2034906","endPage":"1156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05290073.pdf","startPage":"1144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate Synchronous Sampling of Sparse Multiband Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290073/","displayDocTitle":"Multirate Synchronous Sampling of Sparse Multiband Signals","volume":"58","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11105858","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5290073/","publicationDate":"March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate Synchronous Sampling of Sparse Multiband Signals","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-mfleyer-2034906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116406S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5290073","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5290078,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo M.

We propose to measure the performance of this equalizer after a low-density parity-check channel decoder has detected the received sequence. Typically, most channel equalizers concentrate on reducing the bit error rate, instead of providing accurate posterior probability estimates. We show that the accuracy of these estimates is essential for optimal performance of the channel decoder and that the error rate output by the equalizer might be irrelevant to understand the performance of the overall communication receiver. In this sense, GPC is a Bayesian nonlinear classification tool that provides accurate posterior probability estimates with short training sequences. In the experimental section, we compare the proposed GPC-based equalizer with state-of-the-art solutions to illustrate its improved performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05290078.pdf","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Nonlinear Channel Equalization and Soft LDPC Decoding With Gaussian Processes","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2034941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2034941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Nonlinear Channel Equalization and Soft LDPC Decoding With Gaussian Processes","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136156","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5290078/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Nonlinear Channel Equalization and Soft LDPC Decoding With Gaussian Processes","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-jmurillo-fuentes-2034941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103468S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5290078","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290079,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Dong","id":"37394132600"},{"name":"Qingxia Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qingxia","lastName":"Li","id":"37403665400"},{"name":"Wei Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37384043500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5290079","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1127},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, the antenna array design problem in minimum redundancy (MR) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars is addressed, which seeks to maximize the virtual array aperture for a given number of transmitting and receiving (Tx/Rx) elements.

This depletion has given rise to a newer version of the IP, i.e., IP version 6 (IPv6). IPv6 provides sufficient address space to meet the predicted increase of the Internet. Since IPv4 has already widely been deployed, it is required that the existing IPv4 and the newly added IPv6 can coexist and interoperate. Due to the incompatibility of the IPv4 and IPv6 headers, various mechanisms have been proposed to support the interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6. However, they are mostly designed for a static environment. Mobility support of mobile terminals in a mixed IPv4/IPv6 environment remains largely unexplored. It introduces additional overhead and delay to communications. In this paper, we analyze various handoff scenarios for a dual-stack mobile node with a predominant IPv6 home address roaming in a mixed IPv4/IPv6 environment. We investigate how handoffs can be supported and derive the handoff procedures for all scenarios. In addition, we analyze the impact of mobility support on the system performance in terms of handoff-signaling cost, handoff delay, and handoff-failure probability using our designed analytical models. Different traffic and mobility patterns are taken into account in the performance analysis. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of all handoff scenarios. Conclusions from this study can give great in-depth understanding and insights into designing new cost-effective mobility support mechanisms for IPv4/IPv6 transition and interoperability.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2034668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05290082.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2034668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","startPage":"962","endPage":"973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Mobility Support in IPv4/IPv6 Mixed Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Mobility Support in IPv4/IPv6 Mixed Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149575","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5290082/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Mobility Support in IPv4/IPv6 Mixed Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-xie-2034668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10554S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5290082","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290087,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Basu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5463268/5290087/5290087-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaushik Basu received the B.Eng. degree from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpore, India, in 2003, and the M.Sc.

This paper aims at further reduction in the pulsating torque by employing advanced bus-clamping switching sequences, which apply an active vector twice in a subcycle.

The controller is now able to make all required tasks for the correct operation of the APF, such as current-harmonic elimination and removal of high-frequency noise. The low switching-frequency operation of the nine-level converter was an important advantage in the application of the industrial controller. In addition, with the nine-level filter, switching losses were significantly reduced. The filter was designed to work as voltage source and operates as harmonic isolator, improving the filtering characteristics of the passive filter. The control strategy for detecting current harmonics is based on the \u201c p-q theory \u201d and the phase-tracking system in a synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop. The dc-link voltage control is analyzed together with the effect of controller gain and delay time in the system's stability. Simulations for this application are displayed and experiments in a 1-kVA prototype, using the aforementioned industrial controller, were tested, validating the effectiveness of this new application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascaded Nine-Level Inverter for Hybrid-Series Active Power Filter, Using Industrial Controller","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2034185","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5508599/05290089.pdf","startPage":"2761","endPage":"2767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2034185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cascaded Nine-Level Inverter for Hybrid-Series Active Power Filter, Using Industrial Controller","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5290089/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465119","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascaded Nine-Level Inverter for Hybrid-Series Active Power Filter, Using Industrial Controller","sourcePdf":"tie-dixon-2034185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115906S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5508599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5508599","articleId":"5290089","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290091,"authors":[{"name":"Huseyin Atakan Varol","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5419290/5290091/5290091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huseyin Atakan Varol (S\u201901\u2013M\u201909) received the B.S. degree in mechatronics engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2005.

The approach infers user intent to stand, sit, or walk, by recognizing patterns in prosthesis sensor data in real time, without the need for instrumentation of the sound-side leg. Specifically, the intent recognizer utilizes time-based features extracted from frames of prosthesis signals, which are subsequently reduced to a lower dimensionality (for computational efficiency). These data are initially used to train intent models, which classify the patterns as standing, sitting, or walking. The trained models are subsequently used to infer the user's intent in real time. In addition to describing the generalized control approach, this paper describes the implementation of this approach on a single unilateral transfemoral amputee subject and demonstrates via experiments the effectiveness of the approach. In the real-time supervisory control experiments, the intent recognizer identified all 90 activity-mode transitions, switching the underlying middle-level controllers without any perceivable delay by the user. The intent recognizer also identified six activity-mode transitions, which were not intended by the user. Due to the intentional overlapping functionality of the middle-level controllers, the incorrect classifications neither caused problems in functionality, nor were perceived by the user.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2034734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5419290/05290091.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2034734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass Real-Time Intent Recognition of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290091/","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass Real-Time Intent Recognition of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138823","pubMedId":"19846361","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290091/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass Real-Time Intent Recognition of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis","sourcePdf":"tbme-varol-2034734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.29382S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5419290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"263","xplore-issue":"5419290","articleId":"5290091","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5290092,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Hsien Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsien","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37534328000"},{"name":"Shawn S.

We first formulate this problem as a nonlinear constrained optimization by assuming complete knowledge of the application characteristics and the underlying channel conditions. This constrained cross-layer optimization is then decomposed into several subproblems, each corresponding to the cross-layer optimization for one DU. The proposed decomposition method explicitly considers how the cross-layer strategies selected for one DU will impact its neighboring DUs as well as the DUs that depend on it through the resource price (associated with the resource constraint) and neighboring impact factors (associated with the scheduling constraints). However, the attributes (e.g., distortion impact, delay deadline, etc.) of future DUs as well as the channel conditions are often unknown in the considered real-time applications. In this case, the cross-layer optimization is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (MDP) in which the impact of current cross-layer actions on the future DUs can be characterized by a state-value function. We then develop a low-complexity cross-layer optimization algorithm using online learning for each DU transmission. This online optimization utilizes information only about the previous transmitted DUs and past experienced channel conditions, which can be easily implemented in real-time in order to cope with unknown source characteristics, channel dynamics and resource constraints. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed online algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2034938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1415","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05290102.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposition Principles and Online Learning in Cross-Layer Optimization for Delay-Sensitive Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290102/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decomposition Principles and Online Learning in Cross-Layer Optimization for Delay-Sensitive Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105876","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decomposition Principles and Online Learning in Cross-Layer Optimization for Delay-Sensitive Applications","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-ffu-2034938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089988S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5290102","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5290103,"authors":[{"name":"Kasra Payandehjoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Kasra","lastName":"Payandehjoo","id":"37542088700"},{"name":"Ramesh Abhari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Abhari","id":"37283036300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5290103","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1574},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Periodic structures","Metamaterials","Diversity methods","Slot antennas","Prototypes","Antenna measurements","Mutual coupling","Antenna radiation patterns","Impedance","Electromagnetic coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","antenna radiation patterns","diversity reception","MIMO communication","photonic band gap","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna system","diversity gain","radiation pattern","input impedance","slot antenna","electromagnetic band gap","radiation characteristics","radiation frequency","EBG reflector","reverberation chamber","frequency 5.2 GHz","gain 28 dB","gain 3.3 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupling","diversity gain","electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures","multiantenna structures","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","slot antennas"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the effect of mutual coupling on the operation of a multiantenna system.

Our method is based on treating small patches from a 2-D image as matrices as opposed to the conventional vectorial representation, and encoding these patches as sparse projections onto a set of exemplar orthonormal bases, which are learned \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n from a training set. The end result is a low-error, highly compact image/patch representation that has significant theoretical merits and compares favorably with existing techniques (including JPEG) on experiments involving the compression of ORL and Yale face databases, as well as a database of miscellaneous natural images. In the context of learning multiple orthonormal bases, we show the easy tunability of our method to efficiently represent patches of different complexities. Furthermore, we show that our method is extensible in a theoretically sound manner to higher-order matrices (\u00bftensors\u00bf). We demonstrate applications of this theory to compression of well-known color image datasets such as the GaTech and CMU-PIE face databases and show performance competitive with JPEG. Lastly, we also analyze the effect of image noise on the performance of our compression schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Compact Image Representation Using Sparse Matrix and Tensor Projections Onto Exemplar Orthonormal Bases","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2034991","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5382628/05290116.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2034991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Compact Image Representation Using Sparse Matrix and Tensor Projections Onto Exemplar Orthonormal Bases","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5290116/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070887","pubMedId":"19846375","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Compact Image Representation Using Sparse Matrix and Tensor Projections Onto Exemplar Orthonormal Bases","sourcePdf":"19tip02-arajwade-2034991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095822S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5382628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5382628","articleId":"5290116","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290117,"authors":[{"name":"Micky Rakotondrabe","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Micro-Mechatronic Systems, UMR CNRS 6174-UFC/ENSMM/UTBM, Besan\u00e7on, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/5499158/5290117/5290117-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Micky Rakotondrabe (S'05\u2013M'07) received the Engineering diploma from the Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Technologie du Nord (ISTN-ICAM), Lille, France, in 2002, the DEA diploma (M.Sc. equivalent) in automatic control from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es (INSA), Lyon, France, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in automatic control from the Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besan\u00e7on, France, in 2006.","Since September 2007, he has been an Associate Professor with the Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9 and a Researcher with the FEMTO-st Institute.

First, using a genetic programming approach, we design quantum logic circuits, specifically tailored for our computational model, which implement a three-qubit refined Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Aiming at achieving the shortest possible computational time, we compare two design strategies based on exploiting two different sets of entangling gates. The first set comprises fast approximations of controlled-phase gates, while in the second case, we exploit arbitrary entangling gates with gate computational times shorter than those of the first set. Then, considering some recently proposed material implementations of this quantum computational system, we discuss the generation of the near-midinfrared, multiwavelength and picosecond optical pulse sequences necessary for controlling the presented quantum logic circuits. Finally, we analyze potential sources of errors and assess the impact of random fluctuations of the parameters controlling the entangling gates on the overall quantum computational system performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5340088/05290118.pdf","startPage":"1694","endPage":"1703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2024326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2024326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Logic Circuits and Optical Signal Generation for a Three-Qubit, Optically Controlled, Solid-State Quantum Computer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum computing","Optical control","Logic circuits","Signal generators","Solid state circuits","Optical computing","Control systems","Genetic programming","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits","optical control","optical pulse generation","optical signal detection","quantum computing","quantum entanglement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum logic circuits","optical signal generation","optical control","solid-state quantum computer","genetic programming","Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm","controlled-phase gates","picosecond optical pulse sequences","random fluctuations","entangling gates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Near-midinfrared picosecond pulse generation","quantum circuit design","refined Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm","solid-state quantum computation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Logic Circuits and Optical Signal Generation for a Three-Qubit, Optically Controlled, Solid-State Quantum Computer","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5290118/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004970","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Logic Circuits and Optical Signal Generation for a Three-Qubit, Optically Controlled, Solid-State Quantum Computer","sourcePdf":"jstqe-delduce-2024326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183675S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5340088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5340088","articleId":"5290118","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290124,"authors":[{"name":"Yazi Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada","School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5325808/5290124/5290124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yazi Cao (M'09) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Hubei, China, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","Since 2007, he has been a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

In this technique, the neural network is trained to map geometrical variables onto coefficients of transfer functions. A major advance is achieved in resolving the discontinuity problem of numerical solutions of the coefficients with respect to the geometrical variables. Minimum orders of transfer functions for different regions of geometrical parameter space are identified. Our investigations show that varied orders used for different regions result in the discontinuity of coefficients. The gaps between orders are bridged by a new order-changing module, which guarantees the continuity of coefficients and simultaneously maintains the modeling accuracy through a neural network optimization process. This technique is also expanded to include bilinear transfer functions. Once trained, the model provides accurate and fast prediction of the electromagnetic behavior of passive components with geometrical parameters as variables. Compared to conventional training methods, the proposed method allows better accuracy in challenging applications involving high-order transfer functions, wide frequency range, and large geometrical variations. Three examples including parametric modeling of slotted patch antennas, bandstop microstrip filters, and bandpass coupled-line filters are examined to demonstrate the validity of this technique.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2032476","startPage":"2727","endPage":"2742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2032476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5325808/05290124.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Training Approach for Parametric Modeling of Microwave Passive Components Using Combined Neural Networks and Transfer Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290124/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Training Approach for Parametric Modeling of Microwave Passive Components Using Combined Neural Networks and Transfer Functions","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5290124/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10966523","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Training Approach for Parametric Modeling of Microwave Passive Components Using Combined Neural Networks and Transfer Functions","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhang-2032476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.224986S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5325808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5325808","articleId":"5290124","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5290125,"authors":[{"name":"Pabara-Ebiere Patricia Odiowei","affiliation":["Department of Process and Systems Engineering, School of Engineering, Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5406290/5290125/5290125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pabara-Ebiere Patricia Odiowei received the M.Res. degree in chemical engineering from the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2002.

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant. The proposed CVA with KDE approach is able to significantly improve the monitoring performance and detect faults earlier when compared to other methods also examined in this study.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2032654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2032654","startPage":"36","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5406290/05290125.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Dynamic Process Monitoring Using Canonical Variate Analysis and Kernel Density Estimations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Dynamic Process Monitoring Using Canonical Variate Analysis and Kernel Density Estimations","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290125/","accessionNumber":"11105297","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290125/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Dynamic Process Monitoring Using Canonical Variate Analysis and Kernel Density Estimations","sourcePdf":"tii-cao-2032654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097766S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5406290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"5406290","articleId":"5290125","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5290131,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Broggi","affiliation":["Artificial Vision and Intelligent Systems Laboratory (VisLab), Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Parma, Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5338639/5290131/5290131-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Broggi (SM'89\u2013S'93\u2013A'96\u2013SM'06) received the Dr.Eng. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information technology from the Universit\u00e0 di Parma, Parma, Italy, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.","He is currently a Full Professor of computer science with the Universit\u00e0 di Parma, where he was an Associate Researcher with the Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione from 1994 to 1998 and an Associate Professor of artificial intelligence with the Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica from 1998 to 2001.

The approach used in this paper differs from those implemented in traditional pedestrian-detection systems, which are designed to localize all pedestrians in the area in front of the vehicle. Conversely, this approach searches for pedestrians in critical areas only. The environment is reconstructed with a standard laser scanner, whereas the following check for the presence of pedestrians is performed due to the fusion with a vision system. The great advantages of such an approach are that pedestrian recognition is performed on limited image areas, therefore boosting its timewise performance, and no assessment on the danger level is finally required before providing the result to either the driver or an onboard computer for automatic maneuvers. A further advantage is the drastic reduction of false alarms, making this system robust enough to control nonreversible safety systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Urban Pedestrian Detection for Automatic Braking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2009.2032770","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5338639/05290131.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2009.2032770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Urban Pedestrian Detection for Automatic Braking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5290131/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10998998","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Urban Pedestrian Detection for Automatic Braking","sourcePdf":"tits-cerri-2032770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062007S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5338639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5338639","articleId":"5290131","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290136,"authors":[{"name":"Jose I.

Recently, a single-phase multilevel modulator has been introduced, showing its conceptual simplicity and its very low computational cost. In this paper, some of the most conventional multilevel SVM techniques have been chosen to compare their results with those obtained with single-phase multilevel modulators. The obtained results demonstrate that the single-phase multilevel modulators applied to each phase are equivalent with the chosen well-known multilevel SVM techniques. In this way, single-phase multilevel modulators can be applied to a converter with any number of levels and phases, avoiding the use of conceptually and mathematically complex SVM strategies. Analytical calculations and experimental results are shown, validating the proposed concepts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290136/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11341382","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Conventional Space-Vector Modulation Techniques Versus the Single-Phase Modulator for Multilevel Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conventional Space-Vector Modulation Techniques Versus the Single-Phase Modulator for Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-leon-2034674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148352S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5483249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5483249","articleId":"5290136","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290139,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Kujan","affiliation":["Department of Control Theory, Institute of Information Theory and Automation, Prague 8, Czech Republic","Department of Control Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague 6, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Kujan","id":"37419547400"},{"name":"Martin Hrom\u010d\u00edk","affiliation":["Department of Control Theory, Institute of Information Theory and Automation of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague 8, Czech Republic","Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague 6, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hrom\u010d\u00edk","id":"37419547700"},{"name":"Michael \u0160ebek","affiliation":["Department of Control Theory, Institute of Information Theory and Automation, Prague 8, Czech Republic","Department of Control Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague 6, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"\u0160ebek","id":"37324765300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"5290139","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290139","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Polynomials","Equations","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse generation","Baseband","Pulse width modulation inverters","Harmonic analysis","Arithmetic","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomials","PWM invertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast analytical solution","optimal odd single-phase multilevel problem","optimal switching angles","general multilevel odd symmetry waveforms","optimal pulsewidth modulation problem","PWM waveforms","multilevel inverters","trigonometric equations","polynomial system","Pade approximation","formal orthogonal polynomials","optimal switching sequence","three-phase inverter systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Composite sum of powers","formal orthogonal polynomials (FOPs)","multilevel (ML) inverters","Newton's identities","optimal pulsewidth modulation (PWM) problem","Pad\u00e9 approximation","polynomial methods","selected harmonics elimination"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2034677","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5483249/05290139.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"2382","endPage":"2397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5483249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2034677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complete Fast Analytical Solution of the Optimal Odd Single-Phase Multilevel Problem","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the computation of optimal switching angles for general multilevel (ML) odd symmetry waveforms.

Finally, the optimal switching sequence is obtained by computing zeros of two FOP polynomials in one variable or, alternatively, by a special recurrence formula and eigenvalues computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11341376","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Complete Fast Analytical Solution of the Optimal Odd Single-Phase Multilevel Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complete Fast Analytical Solution of the Optimal Odd Single-Phase Multilevel Problem","sourcePdf":"tie-kujan-2034677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052519S","chronDate":"July  2010","isNumber":"5483249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5290139","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290140,"authors":[{"name":"Piyush C.

Owing to a rigid structure and the absence of magnetic source on the rotor, a switched reluctance machine (SRM) is inherently robust and cost effective. In spite of these advantages, several challenges in the control of this machine remain an issue, including high levels of torque ripple, acoustic noise, and a relatively low torque density. This paper presents a new family of SRMs which have higher number of rotor poles than stator poles. Using a newly defined pole design formula, several novel combinations of the stator-rotor poles have been proposed. From the simulation and experimental analysis of a prototype 6/10 configuration, it has been observed that this machine produces higher torque per unit volume and comparable torque ripple when compared to a conventional 6/4 SRM with similar number of phases and constraints in volume. The results presented in this paper make this family of machines a strong contender for survivable high-performance applications for automotive propulsion systems. The simulation and experimental results for the prototype 6/10 configuration have been presented and compared to a conventional 6/4 design for verification.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2034678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2034678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5379132/05290140.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Switched Reluctance Machine Configuration With Higher Number of Rotor Poles Than Stator Poles: Concept to Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel Switched Reluctance Machine Configuration With Higher Number of Rotor Poles Than Stator Poles: Concept to Implementation","volume":"57","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290140/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054659","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290140/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Switched Reluctance Machine Configuration With Higher Number of Rotor Poles Than Stator Poles: Concept to Implementation","sourcePdf":"tie-krishnamurthy-2034678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102113S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5290140","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5290142,"authors":[{"name":"Kalpana Seshadrinathan","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5382628/5290142/5290142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kalpana Seshadrinathan (S'03\u2013M'09) received the B.Tech. degree from the University of Kerala, India, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","She is currently a System Engineer with Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ.

Naturally, the quality of motion representation in videos plays an important role in the perception of video quality, yet existing VQA algorithms make little direct use of motion information, thus limiting their effectiveness. We seek to ameliorate this by developing a general, spatio-spectrally localized multiscale framework for evaluating dynamic video fidelity that integrates both spatial and temporal (and spatio-temporal) aspects of distortion assessment. Video quality is evaluated not only in space and time, but also in space-time, by evaluating motion quality along computed motion trajectories. Using this framework, we develop a full reference VQA algorithm for which we coin the term the MOtion-based Video Integrity Evaluation index, or MOVIE index. It is found that the MOVIE index delivers VQA scores that correlate quite closely with human subjective judgment, using the Video Quality Expert Group (VQEG) FRTV Phase 1 database as a test bed. Indeed, the MOVIE index is found to be quite competitive with, and even outperform, algorithms developed and submitted to the VQEG FRTV Phase 1 study, as well as more recent VQA algorithms tested on this database.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2034992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2034992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5382628/05290142.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Tuned Spatio-Temporal Quality Assessment of Natural Videos","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Motion Tuned Spatio-Temporal Quality Assessment of Natural Videos","volume":"19","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290142/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11084289","pubMedId":"19846374","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290142/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Tuned Spatio-Temporal Quality Assessment of Natural Videos","sourcePdf":"tip-seshadrinathan-2034992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14094S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5382628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"443","xplore-issue":"5382628","articleId":"5290142","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5290144,"authors":[{"name":"Thayne Richard Coffman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5382628/5290144/5290144-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thayne Richard Coffman (M'08\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. and M.Eng. degrees in computer science and electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1996.

Nonexhaustive sampling facilitates the use of quality metrics that take unique values at noninteger disparities. Depth estimates are iteratively refined with a stochastic cooperative search by perturbing the estimates, sampling match quality, and reweighting and aggregating the perturbations. The approach gains significant efficiencies when applied to video, where initial estimates are seeded using information from the previous pair in a novel application of the Z-buffering algorithm. This significantly reduces the number of search iterations required. We present a quantitative accuracy evaluation wherein the proposed method outperforms a microcanonical annealing approach by Barnard and a cooperative approach by Zitnick and Kanade , while using fewer match quality evaluations than either. The approach is shown to have more attractive memory usage and scaling than alternatives based on exhaustive sampling.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2035002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2035002","startPage":"451","endPage":"460","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5382628/05290144.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Stereoscopic Ranging via Stochastic Sampling of Match Quality","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Stereoscopic Ranging via Stochastic Sampling of Match Quality","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290144/","accessionNumber":"11070888","pubMedId":"19846373","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290144/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Stereoscopic Ranging via Stochastic Sampling of Match Quality","sourcePdf":"19tip02-tcoffman-2035002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074757S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5382628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5382628","articleId":"5290144","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290145,"authors":[{"name":"Toshiyo Tamura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5300653/5290145/5290145-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Toshiyo Tamura (S\u201975\u2013M\u201980\u2013SM\u201904) is a Professor with the Department of Medical System Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.

A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented to estimate the severity of tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia from accelerometer data features. SVM-based estimates were compared with clinical scores derived via visual inspection of video recordings taken while patients performed a series of standardized motor tasks. The analysis of the video recordings was performed by clinicians trained in the use of scales for the assessment of the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms and motor complications. Results derived from the accelerometer time series were analyzed to assess the effect on the estimation of clinical scores of the duration of the window utilized to derive segments (to eventually compute data features) from the accelerometer data, the use of different SVM kernels and misclassification cost values, and the use of data features derived from different motor tasks. Results were also analyzed to assess which combinations of data features carried enough information to reliably assess the severity of symptoms and motor complications. Combinations of data features were compared taking into consideration the computational cost associated with estimating each data feature on the nodes of a body sensor network and the effect of using such data features on the reliability of SVM-based estimates of the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms and motor complications.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2033471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5300653/05290148.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2033471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring Motor Fluctuations in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Using Wearable Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring Motor Fluctuations in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Using Wearable Sensors","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957700","pubMedId":"19846382","htmlLink":"/document/5290148/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring Motor Fluctuations in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Using Wearable Sensors","sourcePdf":"titb-bonato-2033471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083153S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5300653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"359","xplore-issue":"5300653","articleId":"5290148","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5290149,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Jovica Marinkovic","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronic Engineering, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5300653/5290149/5290149-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stevan Jovica Marinkovi\u0107 received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electronic engineering from the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni\u0161, Nis, Serbia, in 2008.

The main goal is to develop energy-efficient and reliable communication protocol to support streaming of large amount of data. TDMA synchronization problems are discussed and solutions are presented. Equations for duty cycle calculation are also derived for power consumption and battery life predictions. The power consumption model was also validated through measurements. Our results show that the protocol is energy efficient for streaming communication as well as sending short bursts of data, and thus can be used for different types of physiological signals with different sample rates.

Given the high-spatial-resolution panchromatic (Pan) image and the low-spatial- and high-spectral-resolution multispectral (MS) image acquired over the same geographical area, the problem is to generate a high-spatial- and high-spectral-resolution MS image. This is clearly an ill-posed problem, and hence, we need a proper regularization. We model each of the low-spatial-resolution MS images as the aliased and noisy version of their corresponding high spatial resolution, i.e., fused (to be estimated) MS images. A proper aliasing matrix is assumed to take care of the undersampling process. The high-spatial-resolution MS images to be estimated are then modeled as separate inhomogeneous Gaussian Markov random fields (IGMRF), and a maximum \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i>\n (MAP) estimation is used to obtain the fused image for each of the MS bands. The IGMRF parameters are estimated from the available high-resolution Pan image and are used in the prior model for regularization purposes. Since the method does not directly operate on Pan pixel values as most of the other methods do, spectral distortion is minimum, and the spatial properties are better preserved in the fused image as the IGMRF parameters are learned at every pixel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over some existing methods by conducting experiments on synthetic data, as well as on the images captured by the QuickBird satellite.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416606/05290152.pdf","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2030323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2030323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAP Estimation for Multiresolution Fusion in Remotely Sensed Images Using an IGMRF Prior Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Spatial resolution","Satellites","Image sensors","Markov random fields","Pixel","Remote sensing","Communications technology","Fusion power generation","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image fusion","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution fusion","remotely sensed images","high-spatial-resolution panchromatic image","multispectral image","low-spatial-resolution image","inhomogeneous Gaussian Markov random fields","maximum a posteriori estimation","spectral distortion","fused image","QuickBird satellite images","decimation","super-resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decimation","inhomogeneous Gaussian Markov random field (IGMRF)","multiresolution fusion","multispectral (MS) image","panchromatic (Pan) image","super-resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"MAP Estimation for Multiresolution Fusion in Remotely Sensed Images Using an IGMRF Prior Model","volume":"48","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5290152/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138180","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAP Estimation for Multiresolution Fusion in Remotely Sensed Images Using an IGMRF Prior Model","sourcePdf":"tgrs-joshi-2030323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095112S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5416606","articleId":"5290152","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290153,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Wettels","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Wettels","id":"37394389000"},{"name":"Avinash R.

The sensor takes advantage of its compliant mechanics to provide a triaxial force sensing end-effector for grasp control. By calculating normal and shear forces at the fingertip, the prosthetic hand is able to maintain perturbed objects within the force cone to prevent slip. A Kalman filter is used as a noise-robust method to calculate tangential forces. Biologically inspired algorithms and heuristics are presented that can be implemented online to support rapid, reflexive adjustments of grip.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5312642/05290153.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"723","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2032686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2032686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grip Control Using Biomimetic Tactile Sensing Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Biomimetics","Prosthetic hand","Force sensors","Anthropomorphism","Mechatronics","Tactile sensors","Bayesian methods","Inference algorithms","Biosensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","dexterous manipulators","end effectors","grippers","Kalman filters","manipulators","prosthetics","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grip control","biomimetic tactile sensing systems","anthropomorphic mechatronic prosthetic hand","Bayesian inference","triaxial force sensing end-effector","fingertip","normal forces","shear forces","Kalman filter","noise-robust method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomimetic","dexterous manipulators","grip control","tactile sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Grip Control Using Biomimetic Tactile Sensing Systems","volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5290153/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966886","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grip Control Using Biomimetic Tactile Sensing Systems","sourcePdf":"tmech-wettels-2032686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067852S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5312642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5312642","articleId":"5290153","onlineDate":"20 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290156,"authors":[{"name":"Nasrudin A.

Two reference signals that were identical to each other with an offset that was equivalent to the amplitude of the triangular carrier signal were used to generate PWM signals for the switches. DSP TMS320F2812 is used to implement this PWM switching scheme together with a digital proportional-integral current control algorithm. The inverter offers much less total harmonic distortion and can operate at near-unity power factor. The validity of the proposed inverter is verified through simulation and implemented in a prototype.

In this communication, we present a MIMO system design, where spatial multiplexing is applied with orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The proposed receiver works on a block-by-block basis, where null subcarriers are used for Doppler compensation, pilot subcarriers are used for channel estimation, and a MIMO detector consisting of a hybrid use of successive interference cancellation and soft minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization is coupled with low-density parity-check (LDPC) channel decoding for iterative detection on each subcarrier. The proposed design has been tested using data recorded from three different experiments. A spectral efficiency of 3.5 b/s/Hz was approached in one experiment, while a data rate of 125.7 kb/s over a bandwidth of 62.5 kHz was achieved in another.

Nearly-transform-limited sub-picosecond pulses are generated by this technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290264/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939865","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Band Generation of Picosecond Pulse Using Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifier and Oscillator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-Band Generation of Picosecond Pulse Using Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifier and Oscillator","sourcePdf":"jqe-yzhou-2030691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101231S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5284323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5284323","articleId":"5290264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290265,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Braimiotis","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Telecommunications, School of Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Christos Braimiotis was born in Athens, Greece, in 1979.

The case of transmission over the binary erasure channel was investigated in detail in a companion paper (C. MEacuteasson, A. Montanari, and R.

This paper investigates the extension to general memoryless channels (paying special attention to the binary case). An area theorem for transmission over general memoryless channels is introduced and some of its many consequences are discussed. We show that this area theorem gives rise to an upper bound on the maximum \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i>\n threshold for sparse graph codes.

An iterative algorithm, similar to min-sum and belief propagation, for efficient approximate solution of this problem was proposed by Vontobel and Koetter. In this paper, the convergence rate and computational complexity of this algorithm are studied using a scheduling scheme that we propose. In particular, we are interested in obtaining a feasible vector in the LP decoding problem that is close to optimal in the following sense. The distance, normalized by the block length, between the minimum and the objective function value of this approximate solution can be made arbitrarily small. It is shown that such a feasible vector can be obtained with a computational complexity which scales linearly with the block length. Combined with previous results that have shown that the LP decoder can correct some fixed fraction of errors we conclude that this error correction can be achieved with linear computational complexity. This is achieved by first applying the iterative LP decoder that decodes the correct transmitted codeword up to an arbitrarily small fraction of erroneous bits, and then correcting the remaining errors using some standard method. These conclusions are also extended to generalized LDPC codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","volume":"55","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"10940132","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Approximate Linear Programming Decoding of LDPC Codes With Linear Complexity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Approximate Linear Programming Decoding of LDPC Codes With Linear Complexity","sourcePdf":"55tit11-dburshtein-2030477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047838S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","articleId":"5290280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5290286,"authors":[{"name":"Hanan Weingarten","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Hanan Weingarten (S'06\u2013M'07) received his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1995, 2002, and 2007 respectively.","During the Summer of 2005 he was an intern at Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ.

The degradedness order between the two sets of realizations/users is defined through an additional, fictitious, user whose channel is degraded with respect to all realizations/users from one set while all realizations/users from the other set are degraded with respect to him.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","startPage":"5011","endPage":"5023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Capacity Region of the Degraded Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Compound Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Capacity Region of the Degraded Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Compound Broadcast Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929386","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290286/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Capacity Region of the Degraded Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Compound Broadcast Channel","sourcePdf":"55tit11-hweingarten-2030458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125598S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5290287,"authors":[{"name":"Irina Naydenova","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Irina Naydenova received the Master's degree in mathematics and informatics from the Veliko Tarnovo University, Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria, in 2002.

Our main result is an equivalence condition under which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed to recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of block restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard RIP used extensively in the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP, we also prove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modeling errors. A special case of our framework is that of recovering multiple measurement vectors (MMV) that share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to this context leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as equivalence conditions under which the entire set can be determined efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290295.pdf","startPage":"5302","endPage":"5316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Recovery of Signals From a Structured Union of Subspaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Recovery of Signals From a Structured Union of Subspaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290295/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10929373","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290295/","volume":"55","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Recovery of Signals From a Structured Union of Subspaces","sourcePdf":"55tit11-mmishali-2030471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145369S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"608","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5290296,"authors":[{"name":"Navin Kashyap","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Navin Kashyap (S'97\u2013M'02\u2013SM'07) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, in 1995, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1997, and the M.S. degree in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2001.","From November 2001 to November 2003, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of California, San Diego.

The kappa-complexity of a graphical realization is defined to be the largest dimension of any of its local constraint codes, kappa -complexity is a reasonable measure of the computational complexity of a sum-product decoding algorithm specified by a graphical realization. The main focus of this paper is on the following problem: given a linear code C and a graph G, how small can the kappa-complexity of a realization of C on G be? As useful tools for attacking this problem, we introduce the vertex-cut bound, and the notion of \"vc-treewidth\" for a graph, which is closely related to the well-known graph-theoretic notion of treewidth. Using these tools, we derive tight lower bounds on the kappa-complexity of any realization of C on G. Our bounds enable us to conclude that good error-correcting codes can have low-complexity realizations only on graphs with large vc-treewidth. Along the way, we also prove the interesting result that the ratio of the kappa-complexity of the best conventional trellis realization of a length-n code C to the kappa-complexity of the best cycle-free realization of C grows at most logarithmically with code length n. Such a logarithmic growth rate is, in fact, achievable.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290296.pdf","startPage":"4864","endPage":"4877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraint Complexity of Realizations of Linear Codes on Arbitrary Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290296/","displayDocTitle":"Constraint Complexity of Realizations of Linear Codes on Arbitrary Graphs","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929391","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290296/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint Complexity of Realizations of Linear Codes on Arbitrary Graphs","sourcePdf":"55tit11-nkashyap-2030492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087735S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290299,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nan Liu (S'04\u2013M'07) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2001 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of Maryland, College Park, in 2007.","From 2007 to 2008, she was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Wireless Systems Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.

A channel in this class has the property that, for the transmitter-receiver pair that suffers from interference, the conditional output entropy at the receiver is invariant with respect to the transmitted codewords. We compare the new capacity region upper bound with the Han/Kobayashi achievable rate region for interference channels. This comparison shows that our bound is tight in some cases, thereby yielding specific points on the capacity region as well as sum capacity for certain Z-interference channels. In particular, this result can be used as an alternate method to obtain sum capacity of Gaussian Z-interference channels. We then apply an additional restriction on our channel class: the transmitter-receiver pair that suffers from interference achieves its maximum output entropy with a single input distribution irrespective of the interference distribution. For these channels, we show that our new capacity region upper bound coincides with the Han/Kobayashi achievable rate region, which is therefore capacity-achieving. In particular, for these channels superposition encoding with partial decoding is shown to be optimal and a single-letter characterization for the capacity region is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030490","startPage":"4986","endPage":"4994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290299.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Regions and Bounds for a Class of Z-Interference Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Regions and Bounds for a Class of Z-Interference Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","volume":"55","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290299/","accessionNumber":"10929375","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290299/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Regions and Bounds for a Class of Z-Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"55tit11-nliu-2030490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095249S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":5290300,"authors":[{"name":"Ra\u00dal H.

This setup has attracted significant attention, and several relaying protocols have been reported in the literature. However, most of the proposed solutions require either centrally coordinated scheduling or detailed channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side. Here, an opportunistic relaying scheme is proposed that alleviates these limitations, without sacrificing the system throughput scaling in the regime of large n. The scheme entails a two-hop communication protocol, in which sources communicate with destinations only through half-duplex relays. All nodes operate in a completely distributed fashion, with no cooperation. The key idea is to schedule at each hop only a subset of nodes that can benefit from multiuser diversity. To select the source and destination nodes for each hop, CSI is required at receivers (relays for the first hop, and destination nodes for the second hop), and an index-valued CSI feedback at the transmitters. For the case when n is large and m is fixed, it is shown that the proposed scheme achieves a system throughput of m/2 bits/s/Hz. In contrast, the information-theoretic upper bound of (m/2) log log n bits/s/Hz is achievable only with more demanding CSI assumptions and cooperation between the relays. Furthermore, it is shown that, under the condition that the product of block duration and system bandwidth scales faster than log n log log n, the achievable throughput of the proposed scheme scales as Theta (log n). Notably, this is proven to be the optimal throughput scaling even if centralized scheduling is allowed, thus proving the optimality of the proposed scheme in the scaling law sense. Simulation results indicate a rather fast convergence to the asymptotic limits with the system's size, demonstrating the practical importance of the scaling results.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030435","startPage":"5121","endPage":"5137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290303.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Relaying in Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Relaying in Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","volume":"55","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290303/","accessionNumber":"10929377","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290303/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Relaying in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"55tit11-scui-2030435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162209S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290304,"authors":[{"name":"Sujay Sanghavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sujay Sanghavi (M'08) received the Ph.D. degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2006.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, which he joined in 2008.

First, we study the performance of the classical loopy max-product belief propagation. We show that each fixed-point estimate of max product can be mapped in a natural way to an extreme point of the linear programming (LP) polytope associated with the MWIS problem. However, this extreme point may not be the one that maximizes the value of node weights; the particular extreme point at final convergence depends on the initialization of max product. We then show that if max product is started from the natural initialization of uninformative messages, it always solves the correct LP, if it converges. This result is obtained via a direct analysis of the iterative algorithm, and cannot be obtained by looking only at fixed points. The tightness of the LP relaxation is thus necessary for max-product optimality, but it is not sufficient. Motivated by this observation, we show that a simple modification of max product becomes gradient descent on (a smoothed version of) the dual of the LP, and converges to the dual optimum. We also develop a message-passing algorithm that recovers the primal MWIS solution from the output of the descent algorithm.

In many practical systems, it is reasonable to assume that the CSIT is obtained by a limited (i.e., finite rate) feedback and is therefore imperfect. We consider the design problem of how to use the limited feedback resource to maximize the achievable information rate. In particular, we develop a low complexity power on/off strategy with beamforming (or Grassmann precoding), and analytically characterize its performance. Given the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signal, refer to the eigenvectors as beams, and to the corresponding eigenvalues as the beam's power. A power on/off strategy means that a beam is either turned on with a constant power, or turned off. We will first assume that the beams match the channel perfectly and show that the ratio between the optimal number of beams turned on and the number of antennas converges to a constant when the numbers of transmit and receive antennas approach infinity proportionally. This motivates our power on/off strategy where the number of beams turned on is independent of channel realizations but is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). When the feedback rate is finite, beamforming cannot be perfect, and we characterize the effect of imperfect beamforming by quantization bounds on the Grassmann manifold. By combining the results for power on/off and beamforming, a good approximation to the achievable information rate is derived. Simulations show that the proposed strategy is near optimal and the performance approximation is accurate for all experimented SNRs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290308.pdf","startPage":"5032","endPage":"5047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Information Rate of MIMO Systems With Finite Rate Channel State Feedback Using Beamforming and Power On/Off Strategy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information rates","MIMO","State feedback","Array signal processing","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Receiving antennas","Channel state information","Transmitters","Performance analysis","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","channel coding","channel estimation","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix decomposition","MIMO communication","precoding","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system information rate","finite rate channel state feedback","beamforming","power on-off strategy","multiple-input multiple-output","spectral efficiency","CSIT","eigenvalue decomposition","covariance matrix","receiver antenna","transmitter antenna","signal-to-noise ratio","quantization bound","Grassmann manifold","precoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Grassmann manifold","limited feedback","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","power on/off","precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Information Rate of MIMO Systems With Finite Rate Channel State Feedback Using Beamforming and Power On/Off Strategy","volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5290308/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929396","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Information Rate of MIMO Systems With Finite Rate Channel State Feedback Using Beamforming and Power On/Off Strategy","sourcePdf":"55tit11-wdai-2030470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140359S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290309,"authors":[{"name":"Abla Kammoun","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["Abla Kammoun was born in Sfax, Tunisia.

Such an estimator is frequently encountered in wireless communications and in array processing, and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at its output is a popular performance index. The SINR can be modeled as a random quadratic form which can be studied with the help of large random matrix theory, if one assumes that the dimension of the received and transmitted signals go to infinity at the same pace. This paper considers the asymptotic behavior of the SINR for a wide class of multidimensional signal models that includes general multiple-antenna as well as spread-spectrum transmission models. The expression of the deterministic approximation of the SINR in the large-dimension regime is recalled and the SINR fluctuations around this deterministic approximation are studied. These fluctuations are shown to converge in distribution to the Gaussian law in the large-dimension regime, and their variance is shown to decrease as the inverse of the signal dimension.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290309.pdf","startPage":"5048","endPage":"5063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Central Limit Theorem for the SINR at the LMMSE Estimator Output for Large-Dimensional Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290309/","displayDocTitle":"A Central Limit Theorem for the SINR at the LMMSE Estimator Output for Large-Dimensional Signals","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929380","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290309/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Central Limit Theorem for the SINR at the LMMSE Estimator Output for Large-Dimensional Signals","sourcePdf":"55tit11-whachem-2030463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156533S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290310,"authors":[{"name":"Yuval Kochman","affiliation":["Signals, Information and Algorithms Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Department Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Yuval Kochman (S'07\u2013M'09) was born in Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 1971.

A numerical study demonstrates several cases in which the proposed technique is both simpler to compute and tighter than alternative methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5290270/05290312.pdf","startPage":"5179","endPage":"5196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2030451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2030451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lower Bound on the Bayesian MSE Based on the Optimal Bias Function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Probability distribution","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation error","Estimation theory","Wireless communication","Cities and towns","Degradation","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","mean square error methods","signal processing","statistical distributions","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian estimation problem","minimum mean-squared error method","optimal bias function","deterministic estimation setting","Cramer-Rao bound","vector parameter","arbitrary probability distribution","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian bounds","Bayesian estimation","minimum mean-squared error (MSE) estimation","optimal bias","performance bounds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Lower Bound on the Bayesian MSE Based on the Optimal Bias Function","volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5290312/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929398","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lower Bound on the Bayesian MSE Based on the Optimal Bias Function","sourcePdf":"55tit11-zben-haim-2030451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104772S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5290270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5290270","articleId":"5290312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5290366,"authors":[{"name":"Ulrich Hammes","affiliation":["Signal Processing Group, Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5290365/5290366/5290366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ulrich Hammes (S'05) was born in Koblenz, Germany, in 1980.

Especially in urban or indoor environments and hilly terrains, these estimates are often contaminated by interference due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Standard techniques such as least-squares are inadequate as they lead to erroneous position estimates. We propose robust methods for tracking and geolocation based on a semi-parametric approach that does not require specification of the noise density. Unlike conventional, minimax based, robust techniques, we show that our proposed techniques are more robust as they adapt automatically to the interfering environment. Specifically, we propose a robust extended Kalman filter for tracking a mobile terminal based on robust semi-parametric estimators. Numerical studies for different network scenarios illustrate a substantial gain in performance compared to standard robust competitors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Noise robustness","Working environment noise","Minimax techniques","Performance gain","Kernel","Position measurement","Pollution measurement","Indoor environments","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","mobile radio","numerical analysis","time-of-arrival estimation","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust tracking","geolocation","wireless networks","NLOS environments","time of arrival estimates","indoor environment","urban environment","hilly terrains","interference","least square methods","noise density","minimax technique","robust techniques","extended Kalman filter","mobile terminal","semiparametric estimators","numerical study"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extended Kalman filter","kernel density estimation","non-Gaussian noise","non-line-of-sight (NLOS) mitigation","robust geolocation","robust tracking","semi-parametric estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2028383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5290365/05290366.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2028383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Tracking and Geolocation for Wireless Networks in NLOS Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Tracking and Geolocation for Wireless Networks in NLOS Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290366/","volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290366/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10929195","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Tracking and Geolocation for Wireless Networks in NLOS Environments","sourcePdf":"03jstsp05-uhammes-2028383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09602S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5290365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5290365","articleId":"5290366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290370,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Mazuelas","affiliation":["Center of the Development of Telecommunications (CEDETEL) Edificio Solar, Parque Tecnologico de Boecillo, Valladolid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5290365/5290370/5290370-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Santiago Mazuelas received the Mathematics and Telecommunication Engineer degrees and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain, in 2002, 2007, and 2009, respectively.

Their accuracy depends on the suitability of the propagation models used for the actual propagation conditions. In indoor wireless networks, these propagation conditions are very difficult to predict due to the unwieldy and dynamic nature of the RSS. In this paper, we present a novel method which dynamically estimates the propagation models that best fit the propagation environments, by using only RSS measurements obtained in real time. This method is based on maximizing compatibility of the MS to access points (AP) distance estimates. Once the propagation models are estimated in real time, it is possible to accurately determine the distance between the MS and each AP. By means of these distance estimates, the location of the MS can be obtained by trilateration. The method proposed coupled with simulations and measurements in a real indoor environment, demonstrates its feasibility and suitability, since it outperforms conventional RSS-based indoor location methods without using any radio map information nor a calibration stage.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2029191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290365","startPage":"821","endPage":"831","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5290365/05290370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Indoor Positioning Provided by Real-Time RSSI Values in Unmodified WLAN Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290370/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Indoor Positioning Provided by Real-Time RSSI Values in Unmodified WLAN Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929202","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Indoor Positioning Provided by Real-Time RSSI Values in Unmodified WLAN Networks","sourcePdf":"03jstsp05-smazuelas-2029191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108479S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5290365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"293","xplore-issue":"5290365","articleId":"5290370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5290377,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The accuracy of explicit positioning sensors such as global positioning system (GPS) is often limited for indoor environments. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of building an indoor location tracking system that is cost effective for large scale deployments, can operate over existing Wi-Fi networks, and can provide flexibility to accommodate new sensor observations as they become available. This paper proposes a sigma-point Kalman smoother (SPKS)-based location and tracking algorithm as a superior alternative for indoor positioning. The proposed SPKS fuses a dynamic model of human walking with a number of low-cost sensor observations to track 2-D position and velocity. Available sensors include Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI), binary infra-red (IR) motion sensors, and binary foot-switches. Wi-Fi signal strength is measured using a receiver tag developed by Ekahau, Inc. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a commercially available positioning engine, also developed by Ekahau, Inc. The superior accuracy of our approach over a number of trials is demonstrated.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5290365/05290385.pdf","startPage":"860","endPage":"873","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2032309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2032309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RSSI-Based Indoor Localization and Tracking Using Sigma-Point Kalman Smoothers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"RSSI-Based Indoor Localization and Tracking Using Sigma-Point Kalman Smoothers","htmlLink":"/document/5290385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10929207","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RSSI-Based Indoor Localization and Tracking Using Sigma-Point Kalman Smoothers","sourcePdf":"03jstsp05-apaul-2032309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101238S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5290365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"5290365","articleId":"5290385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5290389,"authors":[{"name":"David Mascarenas","affiliation":["SAIC, Sullivan International Group, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["David Mascare\u00f1as received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Structural Engineering, University of California, San Diego, in 2008.","Currently, he is a member of a DOD Mentor-Protege Program with Sullivan International and SAIC, where he is working on the development of systems health software for unmanned ground vehicle and robotics applications."]},"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mascarenas","id":"38108738100"},{"name":"Eric Flynn","affiliation":["Department of Structural Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Eric Flynn is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Structural Engineering, University of California, San Diego."]},"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Flynn","id":"38112534900"},{"name":"Charles Farrar","affiliation":["Engineering Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Charles Farrar currently leads The Engineering Institute at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

Technical challenges affecting deployment of such a network include ensuring power is maintained at the sensor nodes, reducing installation and maintenance costs, and automating the collection and analysis of data provided by a wireless sensor network. In this work, a new \"mobile host\" WSN paradigm is presented. This architecture utilizes nodes that are deployed without resident power. The associated sensors operate on a mechanical memory principle. A mobile host, such as a robot or unmanned aerial vehicle, is used on an as-needed basis to charge the node by wireless power delivery and subsequently retrieve the data by wireless interrogation. The mobile host may be guided in turn to any deployed node that requires interrogation. The contribution of this work is the first field demonstration of a mobile host wireless sensor network. The sensor node, referred to as THINNER, capable of collecting data wirelessly in the absence of electrical power was developed. A peak displacement sensor capable of interfacing with the THINNER sensor node was also designed and tested. A wireless energy delivery package capable of being carried by an airborne mobile host was developed. Finally, the system engineering required to implement the overall sensor network was carried out.

By recognizing partial-onset seizures, it can improve epilepsy treatment. The circuit consists of a chopper stabilized preamplifier, comprising a modulator, an amplifier, a high-pass filter with low cut-off frequency, and a voltage span detector. The proposed low-power detector extracts seizure onset information from neural signals and monitors the signals over a time period to capture seizure events. Signals are analyzed and the mathematical model is validated in Matlab. Circuits are implemented in a CMOS 0.18-mum process. Total power consumption of the preamplifier and detector are 6.72 uW and 55.51 nW, respectively. Detection performance was verified using intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings from epileptic patients, and the detector accurately identified seizure onsets.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2009.5290426","publicationTitle":"2009 Joint IEEE North-East Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Joint IEEE North-East Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5281728/5290408/05290426.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2009.5290426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290408","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power CMOS-based epileptic seizure onset detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-power CMOS-based epileptic seizure onset detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290426/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10939868","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290426/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power CMOS-based epileptic seizure onset detector","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"p9120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053269S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5281728","isNumber":"5290408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5281728","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5290408","articleId":"5290426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5290427,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Delaunay","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Delaunay","id":"37855522100"},{"name":"Nathalie Deltimple","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Deltimple","id":"37277053700"},{"name":"Didier Belot","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Belot","id":"37268139100"},{"name":"Eric Kerherve","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Kerherve","id":"37277058800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4573-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4574-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290427","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":366},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Feedback","Multiaccess communication","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","CMOS technology","Linearization techniques","Linearity","Transmitters","Broadband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","power amplifiers","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearization","CMOS power amplifier","cartesian feedback","wideband code division multiple access","W-CDMA","size 65 nm","frequency 5 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cartesian Feedback","Linearization technique","Power Amplifier","65nm CMOS technology","W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access)"]}],"abstract":"A study based on improving linearity of an integrated RF power amplifier (PA) has been done for W-CDMA standard.

We show its feasibility through implementation which is detailed and presented using Virtex Xilinx FPGA. This architecture employs only 1926 slices and allows achieving a random key throughput rate of 124 Mbps by using a low system clock with a frequency of up to 15,5 MHz allowing low power consumption especially for embedded applications.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2009.5290495","publicationTitle":"2009 Joint IEEE North-East Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Joint IEEE North-East Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5281728/5290408/05290495.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2009.5290495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time FPGA implementation of Lorenz's chaotic generator for ciphering telecommunications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Real-time FPGA implementation of Lorenz's chaotic generator for ciphering telecommunications","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290495/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10928748","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time FPGA implementation of Lorenz's chaotic generator for ciphering telecommunications","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"p9015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045192S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5281728","isNumber":"5290408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5281728","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5290408","articleId":"5290495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5290496,"authors":[{"name":"Zushu Yan","affiliation":["Beijing Microelectronics Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zushu","lastName":"Yan","id":"37575478500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4573-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4574-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290496","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"abstract":"An embedded capacitor-multiplier compensation (ECMC) scheme for area-efficient low-power multistage amplifiers is introduced in this paper.

Moreover, it provides a feedforward signal path to generate a left-half-plan (LHP) zero and therefore significantly improves the stability and settling behavior of the amplifier. Implemented in a commercial 0.35-mum CMOS process, a three-stage ECMC amplifier driving 1000-pF capacitive load achieves over 100 dB gain, 1.33-MHz unit-gain frequency (UGF), 80deg phase margin and 0.6-V/muS average slew rate, while only dissipating 40-muW under 1.5-V supply.

Traditionally, FMEA does not take the probabilities with which these failures may occur into account. Recently, this shortcoming was addressed by integrating stochastic model checking techniques into the FMEA process. A further improvement is the integration of techniques for the generation of counterexamples for stochastic models, which we propose in this paper. Counterexamples facilitate the redesign of a potentially unsafe system by providing information which components contribute most to the failure of the entire system. The usefulness of this novel approach to the FMEA process is illustrated by applying it to the case study of an airbag system provided by our industrial partner, the TRW Automotive GmbH.","doi":"10.1109/QEST.2009.8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QEST.2009.8","startPage":"299","endPage":"308","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on the Quantitative Evaluation of Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290656/5290657/05290666.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on the Quantitative Evaluation of Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safety Analysis of an Airbag System Using Probabilistic FMEA and Probabilistic Counterexamples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Safety Analysis of an Airbag System Using Probabilistic FMEA and Probabilistic Counterexamples","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290666/","accessionNumber":"10941435","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290666/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safety Analysis of an Airbag System Using Probabilistic FMEA and Probabilistic Counterexamples","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"3808a299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062769S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290656","isNumber":"5290657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290656","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5290657","articleId":"5290666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":5290690,"authors":[{"name":"Cydney B.

The final stages of the genome assembly process inevitably require manual inspection of data inconsistencies and could be greatly aided by visualization. This paper presents our design decisions in translating key data features identified through discussions with analysts into a concise visual encoding. Current visualization tools in this domain focus on local sequence errors making high-level inspection of the assembly difficult if not impossible. We present a novel interactive graph display, ABySS-Explorer, that emphasizes the global assembly structure while also integrating salient data features such as sequence length. Our tool replaces manual and in some cases pen-and-paper based analysis tasks, and we discuss how user feedback was incorporated into iterative design refinements. Finally, we touch on applications of this representation not initially considered in our design phase, suggesting the generality of this encoding for DNA sequence data.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","startPage":"881","endPage":"888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ABySS-Explorer: Visualizing Genome Sequence Assemblies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ABySS-Explorer: Visualizing Genome Sequence Assemblies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930706","pubMedId":"19834150","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290690/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ABySS-Explorer: Visualizing Genome Sequence Assemblies","sourcePdf":"ttg2009060881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104315S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290695,"authors":[{"name":"Tamara Munzner","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Munzner","id":"37349490300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290695","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":370,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5397},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290695","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Encoding","Vocabulary","Coupled mode analysis","Writing","Process design","Concrete","Electronic mail","Diseases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nested process model","visualization design","visual encoding","domain characterization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Models","frameworks","design","evaluation."]}],"abstract":"We present a nested model for the visualization design and validation with four layers: characterize the task and data in the vocabulary of the problem domain, abstract into operations and data types, design visual encoding and interaction techniques, and create algorithms to execute techniques efficiently.

We also provide three recommendations motivated by this model: authors should distinguish between these levels when claiming contributions at more than one of them, authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions at levels above the focus of a paper, and visualization venues should accept more papers on domain characterization.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290695.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation","volume":"15","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290695/","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930710","pubMedId":"19834155","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290695/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation","sourcePdf":"ttg2009060921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134554S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"370","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5290699,"authors":[{"name":"Frank van Ham","affiliation":["IBM ILOG Research, Gentilly, France"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"van Ham","id":"37326291000"},{"name":"Adam Perer","affiliation":["IBM Research, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Perer","id":"37294938400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290699","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2008},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"A common goal in graph visualization research is the design of novel techniques for displaying an overview of an entire graph. However, there are many situations where such an overview is not relevant or practical for users, as analyzing the global structure may not be related to the main task of the users that have semi-specific information needs. Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile) hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest. We show how Furnas' original degree of interest function can be adapted from trees to graphs and how we can use this metric to extract useful contextual subgraphs, control the complexity of the generated visualization and direct users to interesting datapoints in the context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an exploration of a dense online database containing over 3 million legal citations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290699.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cSearch, Show Context, Expand on Demand\u201d: Supporting Large Graph Exploration with Degree-of-Interest","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Context modeling","Law","Legal factors","Information analysis","Mobile computing","Hardware","Tree graphs","Visual databases","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["citation analysis","data visualisation","graph theory","mathematics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large graph exploration","graph visualization","large graph database","immediate context graph","contextual subgraph","dense online database","legal citation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph visualization","network visualization","degree of interest","legal citation networks","focus+context"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"\u201cSearch, Show Context, Expand on Demand\u201d: Supporting Large Graph Exploration with Degree-of-Interest","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5290699/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930714","pubMedId":"19834159","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cSearch, Show Context, Expand on Demand\u201d: Supporting Large Graph Exploration with Degree-of-Interest","sourcePdf":"ttg2009060953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056565S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"113","articleId":"5290699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5290700,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Dwyer","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Dwyer","id":"37326161000"},{"name":"Bongshin Lee","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Bongshin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293389400"},{"name":"Danyel Fisher","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Danyel","lastName":"Fisher","id":"37542391000"},{"name":"Kori Inkpen Quinn","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Kori Inkpen","lastName":"Quinn","id":"38108819900"},{"name":"Petra Isenberg","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Petra","lastName":"Isenberg","id":"37591317800"},{"name":"George Robertson","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Robertson","id":"37448060300"},{"name":"Chris North","affiliation":["Virginia Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"North","id":"37419565900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290700","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":905},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"The research presented in this paper compares user-generated and automatic graph layouts. Following the methods suggested by van Ham et al.

We discuss characteristics of the user-generated layouts and interaction methods employed by users in this process. We then report on a web-based study to compare these layouts with the output of popular automatic layout algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the best of the user-generated layouts performed as well as or better than the physics-based layout. Orthogonal and circular automatic layouts were found to be considerably less effective than either the physics-based layout or the best of the user-generated layouts. We highlight several attributes of the various layouts that led to high accuracy and improved task completion time, as well as aspects in which traditional automatic layout methods were unsuccessful for our tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290700.pdf","startPage":"961","endPage":"968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of User-Generated and Automatic Graph Layouts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Computer displays","Mice","Design optimization","Social network services","Human factors","Automatic control","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","social networking (online)","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user-generated layouts","automatic graph layouts","multitouch interaction","tabletop display","mouse interaction","desktop computer","physics-based layout","circular automatic layouts","orthogonal automatic layouts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph layout","network layout","automatic layout algorithms","user-generated layout","graph-drawing aesthetics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of User-Generated and Automatic Graph Layouts","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5290700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940676","pubMedId":"19834160","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of User-Generated and Automatic Graph Layouts","sourcePdf":"ttg2009060961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08311S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290713,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Tobiasz","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tobiasz","id":"37680420900"},{"name":"Petra Isenberg","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Petra","lastName":"Isenberg","id":"37591317800"},{"name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Sheelagh","lastName":"Carpendale","id":"37285000100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290713","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1040},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290713","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Data visualization","Collaborative work","Displays","Data analysis","Pipelines","Information analysis","Switches","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data visualisation","touch sensitive screens"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lark","colocated collaboration","information visualization","multitouch displays","scoped interaction","temporal flexibility","spatial flexibility","integrated meta-visualization","data analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information visualization","Meta-visualization","Collaboration","Coordination","Co-located work","Workspace awareness"]}],"abstract":"Large multi-touch displays are expanding the possibilities of multiple-coordinated views by allowing multiple people to interact with data in concert or independently.

This integrated meta-visualization supports both the awareness of how views are linked and the freedom to work in concert or independently.

The benefits of visualization for synchronous group knowledge work, however, have not been addressed extensively. Anecdotal evidence and use cases illustrate the benefits of synchronous collaborative information visualization, but very few empirical studies have rigorously examined the impact of visualization on group knowledge work. We have consequently designed and conducted an experiment in which we have analyzed the impact of visualization on knowledge sharing in situated work groups. Our experimental study consists of evaluating the performance of 131 subjects (all experienced managers) in groups of 5 (for a total of 26 groups), working together on a real-life knowledge sharing task. We compare (1) the control condition (no visualization provided), with two visualization supports: (2) optimal and (3) suboptimal visualization (based on a previous survey). The facilitator of each group was asked to populate the provided interactive visual template with insights from the group, and to organize the contributions according to the group consensus. We have evaluated the results through both objective and subjective measures. Our statistical analysis clearly shows that interactive visualization has a statistically significant, objective and positive impact on the outcomes of knowledge sharing, but that the subjects seem not to be aware of this. In particular, groups supported by visualization achieved higher productivity, higher quality of outcome and greater knowledge gains. No statistically significant results could be found between an optimal and a suboptimal visualization though (as classified by the pre-experiment survey). Subjects also did not seem to be aware of the benefits that the visualizations provided as no difference between the visualization and the control conditions was found for the self-reported measures of satisfaction and participation. An implication of our study for information visualization applications is to extend them by using real-time group annotation functionalities that aid in the group sense making process of the represented data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290714/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10940682","pubMedId":"19834174","volume":"15","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Benefits of Synchronous Collaborative Information Visualization: Evidence from an Experimental Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Benefits of Synchronous Collaborative Information Visualization: Evidence from an Experimental Evaluation","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079996S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290720,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Bostock","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bostock","id":"37591067400"},{"name":"Jeffrey Heer","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Heer","id":"37550791300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290720","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":153,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2016},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290720","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Graphics","User interfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Software tools","Costs","Computer science","Data processing","Encoding","Domain specific languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","data visualisation","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Protovis","graphical visualization toolkit","data visualization","high-level visualization systems","low-level graphical systems","rendering API","vector-based drawing programs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information visualization","user interfaces","toolkits","2D graphics."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.174","endPage":"1128","startPage":"1121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290720.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protovis: A Graphical Toolkit for Visualization","abstract":"Despite myriad tools for visualizing data, there remains a gap between the notational efficiency of high-level visualization systems and the expressiveness and accessibility of low-level graphical systems.

We argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is needed. In response, we contribute Protovis, an extensible toolkit for constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In Protovis, designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with visual properties defined as functions of data. This representation achieves a level of expressiveness comparable to low-level graphics systems, while improving efficiency - the effort required to specify a visualization - and accessibility - the effort required to learn and modify the representation. We substantiate this claim through a diverse collection of examples and comparative analysis with popular visualization tools.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290720/","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5290720/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10930726","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"19834180","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Protovis: A Graphical Toolkit for Visualization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protovis: A Graphical Toolkit for Visualization","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064002S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290722,"authors":[{"name":"Fernanda B.

The results suggest that Wordles have become a kind of medium of expression, and that a ldquoparticipatory culturerdquo has arisen around them.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290722.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.171","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Participatory Visualization with Wordle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290722/","displayDocTitle":"Participatory Visualization with Wordle","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290722/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10930728","pubMedId":"19834182","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Participatory Visualization with Wordle","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069302S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5290724,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Drexel University, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38108288000"},{"name":"Chaomei Chen","affiliation":["Drexel University, USA"],"firstName":"Chaomei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280749300"},{"name":"Jiexun Li","affiliation":["Drexel University, USA"],"firstName":"Jiexun","lastName":"Li","id":"37066976100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290724","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290724","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Information analysis","Prototypes","Java","Tree data structures","Chaos","Joining processes","Testing","Libraries","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical surveys","astronomy computing","citation analysis","data visualisation","Java","network theory (graphs)","pattern clustering","scientific information systems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intellectual structure visualization","paper-reference matrix","scientific domain analysis","co-cited unit","reference analysis","author analysis","reference-reference matrix","co-citation relationship","node-link network visualization","visual analysis","information source","FP-tree","Java-based prototype system","information visualization","Sloan Digital Sky Survey","SDSS","tightly-knit cluster"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intellectual Structure","Paper-reference Matrix","FP-tree","Co-citation"]}],"abstract":"Visualizing the intellectual structure of scientific domains using co-cited units such as references or authors has become a routine for domain analysis. In previous studies, paper-reference matrices are usually transformed into reference-reference matrices to obtain co-citation relationships, which are then visualized in different representations, typically as node-link networks, to represent the intellectual structures of scientific domains. Such network visualizations sometimes contain tightly knit components, which make visual analysis of the intellectual structure a challenging task. In this study, we propose a new approach to reveal co-citation relationships. Instead of using a reference-reference matrix, we directly use the original paper-reference matrix as the information source, and transform the paper-reference matrix into an FP-tree and visualize it in a Java-based prototype system. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through visual analyses of the intellectual structure of two domains: information visualization and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The results show that our visualization not only retains the major information of co-citation relationships, but also reveals more detailed sub-structures of tightly knit clusters than a conventional node-link network visualization.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290724.pdf","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualizing the Intellectual Structure with Paper-Reference Matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Visualizing the Intellectual Structure with Paper-Reference Matrices","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930729","pubMedId":"19834184","htmlLink":"/document/5290724/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualizing the Intellectual Structure with Paper-Reference Matrices","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059122S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290726,"authors":[{"name":"Frank van Ham","affiliation":["IBM Research, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"van Ham","id":"37326291000"},{"name":"Martin Wattenberg","affiliation":["IBM Research, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Wattenberg","id":"37550759700"},{"name":"Fernanda B.

Several sophisticated algorithms have been proposed for constructing contour trees while they often complicate the software implementation especially for higher-dimensional cases such as time-varying volumes. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to plotting in 3D space, approximate contour trees from a set of scattered samples embedded in the high-dimensional space. Our main idea is to take advantage of manifold learning so that we can elongate the distribution of high-dimensional data samples to embed it into a low-dimensional space while respecting its local proximity of sample points. The contribution of this paper lies in the introduction of new distance metrics to manifold learning, which allows us to reformulate existing algorithms as a variant of currently available dimensionality reduction scheme. Efficient reduction of data sizes together with segmentation capability is also developed to equip our approach with a coarse-to-fine analysis even for large-scale datasets. Examples are provided to demonstrate that our proposed scheme can successfully traverse the features of volumes and their temporal behaviors through the constructed contour trees.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290728.pdf","startPage":"1185","endPage":"1192","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Manifold Learning to Plotting Approximate Contour Trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Applying Manifold Learning to Plotting Approximate Contour Trees","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5290728/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940688","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","pubMedId":"19834188","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Manifold Learning to Plotting Approximate Contour Trees","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118572S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290753,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Krone","affiliation":["Visualization Research Center VISUS, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Krone","id":"37885145500"},{"name":"Katrin Bidmon","affiliation":["Visualization Research Center VISUS, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Katrin","lastName":"Bidmon","id":"37282594900"},{"name":"Thomas Ertl","affiliation":["Visualization Research Center VISUS, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ertl","id":"37268023800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290753","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":639},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Data visualization","Medical simulation","Solvents","Pharmaceuticals","Analytical models","Casting","Acceleration","Surface impedance","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data visualisation","interactive systems","molecular biophysics","probability","proteins","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive visualization techniques","molecular surface dynamics","molecular dynamics simulations","rendering quality","time-dependent protein data","protein solvent excluded surface","GPU ray casting technique","visual complexity","spatial probability density","protein flexibility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Point-based Data","Time-varying Data","GPU","Ray Casting","Molecular Visualization","Surface Extraction","Isosurfaces"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computational Biology","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Models, Molecular","Molecular Conformation","Protein Conformation","Proteins","Surface Properties"]}],"abstract":"Molecular dynamics simulations of proteins play a growing role in various fields such as pharmaceutical, biochemical and medical research. Accordingly, the need for high quality visualization of these protein systems raises. Highly interactive visualization techniques are especially needed for the analysis of time-dependent molecular simulations. Beside various other molecular representations the surface representations are of high importance for these applications. So far, users had to accept a trade-off between rendering quality and performance - particularly when visualizing trajectories of time-dependent protein data. We present a new approach for visualizing the solvent excluded surface of proteins using a GPU ray casting technique and thus achieving interactive frame rates even for long protein trajectories where conventional methods based on precomputation are not applicable. Furthermore, we propose a semantic simplification of the raw protein data to reduce the visual complexity of the surface and thereby accelerate the rendering without impeding perception of the protein's basic shape. We also demonstrate the application of our solvent excluded surface method to visualize the spatial probability density for the protein atoms over the whole period of the trajectory in one frame, providing a qualitative analysis of the protein flexibility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Visualization of Molecular Surface Dynamics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.157","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290753.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Visualization of Molecular Surface Dynamics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5290753/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930747","pubMedId":"19834213","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Visualization of Molecular Surface Dynamics","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080652S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290756,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon L.

We propose that particle systems have a significantly more general role in sampling structure from unsegmented data. We describe a particle system that computes samplings of crease features (i.e. ridges and valleys, as lines or surfaces) that effectively represent many anatomical structures in scanned medical data. Because structure naturally exists at a range of sizes relative to the image resolution, computer vision has developed the theory of scale-space, which considers an n-D image as an (n + 1)-D stack of images at different blurring levels. Our scale-space particles move through continuous four-dimensional scale-space according to spatial constraints imposed by the crease features, a particle-image energy that draws particles towards scales of maximal feature strength, and an inter-particle energy that controls sampling density in space and scale. To make scale-space practical for large three-dimensional data, we present a spline-based interpolation across scale from a small number of pre-computed blurrings at optimally selected scales. The configuration of the particle system is visualized with tensor glyphs that display information about the local Hessian of the image, and the scale of the particle. We use scale-space particles to sample the complex three-dimensional branching structure of airways in lung CT, and the major white matter structures in brain DTI.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Image sampling","Data visualization","Mesh generation","Shape","Anatomical structure","Biomedical imaging","Image resolution","Computer vision","Spline"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","image sampling","image segmentation","interpolation","medical image processing","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scale-space particles","implicit surface sampling","mesh generation","shape analysis","computer vision","image resolution","scale-space theory","particle-image energy","spline-based interpolation","complex three-dimensional branching structure","lung CT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Systems","Crease Features","Ridge and Valley Detection","Lung CT","Diffusion Tensor MRI"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Brain","Computer Graphics","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Lung","Lung","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Normal Distribution","Particle Size","Sample Size","Surface Properties","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290756.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling and Visualizing Creases with Scale-Space Particles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling and Visualizing Creases with Scale-Space Particles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290756/","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290756/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10930749","pubMedId":"19834216","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling and Visualizing Creases with Scale-Space Particles","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112583S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290775,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Knoll","affiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Knoll","id":"37692671900"},{"name":"Younis Hijazi","affiliation":["LSIIT, University of Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Younis","lastName":"Hijazi","id":"37544121300"},{"name":"Rolf Westerteiger","affiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Westerteiger","id":"38108787400"},{"name":"Mathias Schott","affiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Schott","id":"38099955600"},{"name":"Charles Hansen","affiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Hansen","id":"37266777200"},{"name":"Hans Hagen","affiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Hagen","id":"37282578800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5290775","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Direct volume rendering and isosurfacing are ubiquitous rendering techniques in scientific visualization, commonly employed in imaging 3D data from simulation and scan sources. Conventionally, these methods have been treated as separate modalities, necessitating different sampling strategies and rendering algorithms. In reality, an isosurface is a special case of a transfer function, namely a Dirac impulse at a given isovalue. However, artifact-free rendering of discrete isosurfaces in a volume rendering framework is an elusive goal, requiring either infinite sampling or smoothing of the transfer function. While preintegration approaches solve the most obvious deficiencies in handling sharp transfer functions, artifacts can still result, limiting classification. In this paper, we introduce a method for rendering such features by explicitly solving for isovalues within the volume rendering integral. In addition, we present a sampling strategy inspired by ray differentials that automatically matches the frequency of the image plane, resulting in fewer artifacts near the eye and better overall performance. These techniques exhibit clear advantages over standard uniform ray casting with and without preintegration, and allow for high-quality interactive volume rendering with sharp C\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sup>\n transfer functions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Casting","Sampling methods","Transfer functions","Isosurfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Image sampling","Smoothing methods","Frequency","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rendering (computer graphics)","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volume ray casting","differential sampling","peak finding","direct volume rendering","transfer function smoothing","Dirac impulse","artifact-free rendering","discrete isosurfaces","ray differentials","isosurfacing","ubiquitous rendering techniques","transfer function infinite sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["direct volume rendering","isosurface","ray casting","ray differentials","sampling","transfer function","preintegration","view dependent"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5290686/05290775.pdf","startPage":"1571","endPage":"1578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volume Ray Casting with Peak Finding and Differential Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Volume Ray Casting with Peak Finding and Differential Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290775/","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290775/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10930764","pubMedId":"19834235","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volume Ray Casting with Peak Finding and Differential Sampling","sourcePdf":"ttg2009061571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075072S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5290686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5290686","articleId":"5290775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290875,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyu Ji","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering and Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Ji","id":"38106139400"},{"name":"Xianghua Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering and Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xianghua","lastName":"Yang","id":"38104334600"},{"name":"Yudong He","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering and Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yudong","lastName":"He","id":"38102903900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4721-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290875","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Telemetry","Signal processing algorithms","Direction of arrival estimation","Radio frequency","Antenna arrays","Linear antenna arrays","Mobile communication","Adaptive arrays","Sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming algorithm","telemetry system","DOA-estimation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of adaptive beamforming algorithm for telemetry system","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290832","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"2009 European Wireless Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286915/5290832/05290875.pdf","startPage":"17","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290875","abstract":"In telemetry system, the desired signal is hard to obtain when using adaptive beamforming technology.

Main components of such architectures are multimode radios capable of operating according to GSM, HSPA, WiMAX and LTE standards, known as remote radio heads (RRH). The key feature of remote radio heads is the extended software configurability which enables the deployment of more flexible and energy-efficient radio solutions. This paper describes a modern multi-mode radio system reference architecture and the major digital building blocks that when combined together enable multi-mode and more power efficient operation. It concentrates on blocks which can efficiently run multi-rate digital signal processing and blocks that increase radio power efficiency by linearizing the power amplifier output stage. The importance of a digital predistortion (DPD) block is emphasized and an adaptive polynomial approach based on Cartesian to polar conversion is then proposed. Such radio architecture has successfully been implemented on a low-cost FPGA family meeting the WiMAX/LTE spectrum and error vector magnitude (EVM) requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10930846","htmlLink":"/document/5290895/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Advanced multimode radio for wireless & mobile broadband communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced multimode radio for wireless & mobile broadband communication","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073901S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286915","isNumber":"5290832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286915","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5290832","articleId":"5290895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5290896,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Top","affiliation":["Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Top","id":"37698310700"},{"name":"Maya Gokhale","affiliation":["Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Maya","lastName":"Gokhale","id":"37265510600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3716-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290896","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Application software","Kernel","Computer architecture","Computer applications","Laboratories","Decoding","Frequency","Bioinformatics","Software algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","parallel processing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ambric massively parallel processor array","field programmable gate array","trellis decoder","n-gram frequency counter","Ambric development system","Altera Stratix II","baseline sequential algorithm","TeraOp system-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ambric","MPPA"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the mapping approach, programmability, and performance of the Ambric massively parallel processor array (MPPA), and compares these aspects to an FPGA.

The NetFPGA is an open networking platform accelerator that enables rapid development of hardware-accelerated packet processing applications. The packet generator application allows Internet packets to be transmitted at line rate on up to four gigabit Ethernet ports simultaneously. Data transmitted is specified in a standard PCAP file, transferred to local memory on the NetFPGA card, then sent on the gigabit links using a precise data rate, inter-packet delay, and number of iterations specified by the user. The hardware circuit also simultaneously operates as a packet capture system, allowing traffic to be captured from up to all four of the gigabit Ethernet ports. Timestamps are recorded and traffic can be transferred back to the host and stored using the same PCAP format. The project has been implemented as a fully open-source project and serves as an exemplar project on how to build and distribute NetFPGA applications. All of the code (Verilog hardware, system software, verification scripts, make files, and support tools) can be freely downloaded from the NetFPGA.org Website. Benchmarks comparing this hardware-accelerated application to the fastest available PC with a PCIe NIC shows that the FPGA-based hardware-accelerator far exceeds the performance possible using TCP-reply software.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2009.29","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290879/5290880/05290917.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2009.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Packet Generator on the NetFPGA Platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290917/","displayDocTitle":"A Packet Generator on the NetFPGA Platform","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290917/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10941489","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Packet Generator on the NetFPGA Platform","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084726S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5290920,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Ho Byun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Byun","id":"37402771500"},{"name":"Arun Ravindran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Ravindran","id":"37270225800"},{"name":"Arindam Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37278322100"},{"name":"Bharat Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Bharat","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37385230200"},{"name":"David Chassin","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Chassin","id":"37284142200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3716-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290920","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":620},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Gaussian processes","Load flow","High performance computing","Field programmable gate arrays","Voltage","Power system simulation","Hardware","Power system analysis computing","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","load flow","power grids","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computationally intensive power flow problem","three-phase steady-state condition","FPGA acceleration","Gauss-Seidel power flow solver","transmission module","GridLAB-D power distribution simulator","SGI Altix-RASC system","Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGA","bus voltage calculation","sequential software implementation","CPU-FPGA implementation","high performance reconfigurable computer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reconfigurable computing","power flow computing","Gauss-Seidel","FPGA","bus voltage computations"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating the Gauss-Seidel Power Flow Solver on a High Performance Reconfigurable Computer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290920","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2009.23","startPage":"227","endPage":"230","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290879/5290880/05290920.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2009.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290880","abstract":"The computationally intensive power flow problem determines the voltage magnitude and phase angle at each bus in a power system for hundreds of thousands of buses under balanced three-phase steady-state conditions.

The prototype hardware is implemented on an SGI Altix-RASC system equipped with a Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGA. Due to capacity limitations of the FPGA, only the bus voltage calculations of the power network are implemented on hardware while the branch current calculations are implemented in software. For a 200,000 bus system, the bus voltage calculation on the FPGA achieves a 48x speed-up with PQ buses and a 62x for PV over an equivalent sequential software implementation. The average overall speed up of the CPU-FPGA implementation with 100 iterations of the Gauss-Seidel power solver is 2.6x over a software implementation, with the branch calculations on the CPU accounting for 85% of the total execution time. The CPU-FPGA implementation also shows linear scaling with increase in the size of the input power network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290920/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10941491","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating the Gauss-Seidel Power Flow Solver on a High Performance Reconfigurable Computer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating the Gauss-Seidel Power Flow Solver on a High Performance Reconfigurable Computer","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.219082S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5290921,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cong","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Cong","id":"37276009100"},{"name":"Karthik Gururaj","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Gururaj","id":"37870502100"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37404908700"},{"name":"Chunyue Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chunyue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539135600"},{"name":"Zhiru Zhang","affiliation":["Auto ESL Design Technologies, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiru","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37069315800"},{"name":"Sheng Zhou","affiliation":["Auto ESL Design Technologies, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38105061000"},{"name":"Yi Zou","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zou","id":"37672489600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3716-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290921","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":309},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290921","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Uncertainty","Algorithm design and analysis","Fixed-point arithmetic","USA Councils","Error analysis","Computer science","Hardware","Constraint optimization","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differentiation","fixed point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed-point precision optimization","precision analysis","floating-point algorithm","fixed-point hardware implementations","core analysis techniques","dynamic analysis","static error analysis","affine arithmetic","general interval arithmetic","automatic differentiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bitwidth","static analysis","precision analysis"]}],"abstract":"Precision analysis and optimization is very important when transforming a floating-point algorithm into fixed-point hardware implementations. The core analysis techniques are either based on dynamic analysis or static analysis. We believe in static error analysis, as it is the only technique that can guarantee the desired worst-case accuracy. In this paper we study various underlying arithmetic candidates that can be used in static error analysis and compare their computed sensitivities. The approaches studied include Affine Arithmetic(AA), General Interval Arithmetic (GIA) and Automatic Differentiation (Symbolic Arithmetic). Our study shows that symbolic method is preferred for expressions with higher order cancellation. For programs without strong cancellation, any method works fairly well and GIA slightly outperforms others.

Using iterative methods for solving linear systems, one can obtain improved accuracy either by running more iterations or by using more precise internal computations, unlike direct methods, where accuracy is only a function of operation precision. Thus, in iterative methods, for a given accuracy requirement we may conduct fewer iterations in a higher precision, or more in a lower precision.

However, no work actually compares the performance between FPGAs and CPUs using the standard benchmarks such as the LINPACK benchmark. We propose and implement an FPGA-based hardware design of the LINPACK benchmark, the key step of which is LU decomposition with pivoting. We introduce a fine-grained pipelined LU decomposition algorithm that enables optimum performance by exploiting fine-grained pipeline parallelism. A scalable linear array of processing elements (PEs), which is the core component of our hardware design, is proposed to implement this algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported FPGA-based pipelined implementation of LU decomposition with pivoting. A total of 19 PEs can be integrated into an Altera Stratix II EP2S130F1020C5 on our self-designed development board.

Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support the current largest routing table(consisting of 257 K prefixes in backbone routers). We propose a novel scalable high-throughput, low-power SRAM-based linear pipeline architecture for IP lookup. Using a single FPGA, the proposed architecture can support the current largest routing table, or even larger tables of up to 400 K prefixes. Our architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger routing tables (up to 1.7 M prefixes). Our implementation shows a high throughput (340 mega lookups per second or 109 Gbps), even when external SRAM is used. The use of SRAM (instead of TCAM) leads to an order of magnitude reduction in power dissipation. Additionally, the architecture supports power saving by allowing only a portion of the memory to be active on each memory access. Our design also maintains packet input order and supports in-place non-blocking route updates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable High Throughput and Power Efficient IP-Lookup on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2009.42","startPage":"167","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2009.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290880","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290879/5290880/05290932.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Scalable High Throughput and Power Efficient IP-Lookup on FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290932/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10962156","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable High Throughput and Power Efficient IP-Lookup on FPGA","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098017S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5290933,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Edward McKechnie","affiliation":["Institute for System Level Integration, Livingston, UK","Xilinx, Inc., Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Paul Edward","lastName":"McKechnie","id":"37669451500"},{"name":"Michaela Blott","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Blott","id":"38479349300"},{"name":"Wim A.

To facilitate debugging and performance evaluation, designers require on-chip monitors that provide abstractions of low-level details and a system-level perspective. In this paper, we present five architectures that permit transaction-based communication-centric monitoring of packet processing systems. We compare the resource requirements and filtering functionality of each architecture, demonstrating that sequential matching is more resource efficient than parallel matching. We also show that generic filtering has a low overhead compared to specialised filtering while providing additional flexibility. A scalable architecture is also presented, which is more flexible and adaptable to matching requirements than other architectures. These monitoring architectures permit the implementation of a highly effective test system which provides a system-level perspective and is more resource efficient than conventional RTL debug environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290879/5290880/05290933.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"182","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2009.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2009.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural Comparison of Instruments for Transaction Level Monitoring of FPGA-Based Packet Processing Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Monitoring","Field programmable gate arrays","Debugging","System-on-a-chip","Filtering","Timing","Concurrent computing","System testing","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer debugging","computer networks","field programmable gate arrays","filtering theory","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based packet processing systems","fine-grained parallelism","on-chip monitors","transaction-based communication-centric monitoring","filtering functionality","sequential matching","parallel matching","generic filtering","scalable architecture","RTL debug environments","instrument architecture","debugging evaluation","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","debug","instrumentation","monitoring","transaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Architectural Comparison of Instruments for Transaction Level Monitoring of FPGA-Based Packet Processing Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290933/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10962157","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural Comparison of Instruments for Transaction Level Monitoring of FPGA-Based Packet Processing Systems","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053363S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5290936,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Luu","affiliation":["Edward S.

The success of PDT depends on the accurate computation of light dose distribution. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations can provide an accurate solution for light dose distribution, but have high computation time that prevents them from being used in treatment planning. To alleviate this problem, a hardware design of an MC simulation based on the gold standard software in biophotonics was implemented on a large modern FPGA. This implementation achieved a 28-fold speedup and 716-fold lower power-delay product compared to the gold standard software executed on a 3 GHz Intel Xeon 5160 processor. The accuracy of the hardware was compared to the gold standard using a realistic skin model. An experiment using 100 million photon packets yielded a light dose distribution that diverged by less than 0.1 mm. We also describe our development methodology, which employs an intermediate hardware description in SystemC prior to Verilog coding that led to significant design effort efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10962159","htmlLink":"/document/5290936/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based Monte Carlo Computation of Light Absorption for Photodynamic Cancer Therapy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based Monte Carlo Computation of Light Absorption for Photodynamic Cancer Therapy","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062888S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5290940,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuki Taniguchi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Advanced Wireless Communication research Center (AWCC), University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuki","lastName":"Taniguchi","id":"37273806800"},{"name":"Yoshio Karasawa","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Advanced Wireless Communication research Center (AWCC), University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Karasawa","id":"37270162200"},{"name":"Nobuo Nakajima","affiliation":["Department of Human Communication, Advanced Wireless Communication research Center (AWCC), University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuo","lastName":"Nakajima","id":"37413032000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4721-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290940","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","MIMO","Attenuation","Downlink","Geometry","Humans","Wireless communication","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","iterative methods","mobile antennas","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["base station cooperation","multiantenna cellular system","user terminals","signal attenuation","radiofrequency interferences","cell model","zero forcing-based approach","signal-to-noise ratio","circular iterative weight design","downlink scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative systems","MIMO systems","land mobile radio","arrays signal processing"]}],"abstract":"In cellular systems, the user terminals are suffered from the attenuation of the signal from the base station (BS) and the interferences from other users.

The coprocessor architecture, targeted at both SVM training and classification, is based on clusters of vector processing elements (VPEs) operating in single-instruction multiple data (SIMD) mode to take advantage of large amounts of data parallelism in the application. We use the FPGA's DSP elements as parallel multiply-accumulators (MACs), a core computation in SVMs. A key feature of the architecture is that it is customized to low precision arithmetic which permits one DSP unit to perform two or more MACs in parallel. Low precision also reduces the required number of parallel off-chip memory accesses by packing multiple data words on the FPGA-memory bus. We have built a prototype using an off-the-shelf PCI-based FPGA card with a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA and 1 GB DDR2 memory. For SVM training, we observe application-level end-to-end computation speeds of over 9 billion multiply-accumulates per second (GMACs). For SVM classification, using data packing, the application speed increases to 14 GMACs. The FPGA-based system is about 20times faster than a dual Opteron 2.2 GHz processor CPU, and dissipates around 10 W of power.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2009.34","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290879/5290880/05290941.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2009.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Massively Parallel FPGA-Based Coprocessor for Support Vector Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290941/","displayDocTitle":"A Massively Parallel FPGA-Based Coprocessor for Support Vector Machines","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290941/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10962162","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Massively Parallel FPGA-Based Coprocessor for Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052417S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290947,"authors":[{"name":"Jin H.

The problem is that it uses complex heuristics which make it difficult to simultaneously achieve both substantial speed-up and exact agreement with the original output. Our approach is to prefilter the database. To make this work we have developed a novel heuristic which we append to a previously described structure for ungapped alignment. This enables us to quickly reduce the database by factors of 300 and 1100, for the ungapped and gapped options, respectively, while rejecting no significant sequences. On current hardware we anticipate a speed-up of at least a factor of 10 for NCBI BLASTP, independent of sensitivity settings.

More specifically, at the transmitter, we employ the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) on each transmit antenna in order to counteract the multipath degradations and, at the receiver, we propose to resort to a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) decision-feedback (DF) MIMO equalizer that can process the received signals over multiple OFDM symbol periods in order to exploit the time redundancy of the ARQ retransmissions at the data-link-layer. Moreover, we propose a transmitter architecture that space-time codes the OFDM signals on the transmit antennas when the ARQ retransmission occurs: such a strategy allows the MIMO transceiver to better exploit the space redundancy between multiple transmissions. The performance analysis has been carried out in terms of the packet delivery ratio and of the normalized throughput. The results show that both the uncoded and the coded systems can achieve important advantages with respect to the standard transceiver that does not exploit the time redundancy of the ARQ retransmissions. Moreover, by means of the computer simulations we show that the coded system is more robust to the channel state information errors with respect to the uncoded and the standard ones.","publicationTitle":"2009 European Wireless Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286915/5290832/05290949.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290832","startPage":"214","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DF equalizer synthesis for ST-based MIMO OFDM transceiver exploiting ARQ retransmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DF equalizer synthesis for ST-based MIMO OFDM transceiver exploiting ARQ retransmissions","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290949/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940768","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290949/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DF equalizer synthesis for ST-based MIMO OFDM transceiver exploiting ARQ retransmissions","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044634S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286915","isNumber":"5290832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286915","xplore-issue":"5290832","articleId":"5290949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5290953,"authors":[{"name":"David Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37289926400"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3716-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":832},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Accelerated Simulation of Biologically Plausible Spiking Neural Networks","abstract":"Artificial neural networks are a key tool for researchers attempting to understand and replicate the behaviour and intelligence found in biological neural networks. Software simulations offer great flexibility and the ability to select which aspects of biological networks to model, but are slow when operating on more complex biologically plausible models; while dedicated hardware solutions can be very fast, they are restricted to fixed models. This paper uses FPGAs to achieve a compromise between model complexity and simulation speed, such that a fully-connected network of 1024 neurons,based on the biologically plausible Izhikevich spiking model,can be simulated at 100 times real-time speed. The simulator is based on a re-usable interconnection architecture for storing synapse weights and calculating thalamic input, which makes use of the large number of available block-RAMs and huge amounts of fine-grain parallelism. The simulator achieves a sustained throughput of 2.26 GFlops in double-precision, and a single Virtex-5 xc5vlx330t without off-chip storage running at 133 MHz is 16 times faster than a 3 GHz Core2 CPU, and 1.1 times faster than a single-precision 1.2 GHz 30-core GPU.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Biological system modeling","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent networks","Biological neural networks","Neural network hardware","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","neural nets","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA accelerated simulation","biologically plausible spiking neural networks","artificial neural networks","dedicated hardware solutions","model complexity","fully-connected network","re-usable interconnection architecture","block-RAM","fine-grain parallelism","Izhikevich spiking model","thalamic inputs","synapse weights"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","spiking neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290953","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2009.46","startPage":"45","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290879/5290880/05290953.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2009.46","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290953/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Accelerated Simulation of Biologically Plausible Spiking Neural Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10962169","htmlLink":"/document/5290953/","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Accelerated Simulation of Biologically Plausible Spiking Neural Networks","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055385S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5290954,"authors":[{"name":"Suhaib A.

FPGAs offer an ideal implementation platform, combining high performance with flexibility. While significant research has been undertaken in the area of FPGA partial reconfiguration, it has focussed primarily on low-level architecture-specific implementations. Building upon this previous work, we present a system model and software architecture for implementing runtime adaptive applications on FPGAs, separating the control and processing planes and abstracting away the details of hardware reconfiguration from the system designer. Hardware processing components appear as software components in the runtime system, enabling their inclusion in adaptive applications.

Accuracy and speed of estimation are keys to select appropriate spectrum sensing technique. Conventional spectrum estimation techniques based on short time Fourier transform suffer from familiar problems such as low frequency resolution, large variance of estimated power and large side lobes. In this article, the possibility of employing wavelet packet decomposition for new spectrum sensing is investigated. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed approach, four types of sources (transmitters) are used, namely partial band, single tone, multi tone and swept tone. To simulate the temporal dynamics in CR, a special kind of source called swept tone source is devised. The novelty of this work relates to the development of wavelet packet decomposition using filter bank approach as a new spectrum sensing tool recommended for CR. The results of this study show that the wavelet based spectral estimation is a promising technique for CR applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10930860","htmlLink":"/document/5290958/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A study on application of wavelets and filter banks for Cognitive Radio spectrum estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on application of wavelets and filter banks for Cognitive Radio spectrum estimation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050334S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286915","isNumber":"5290832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286915","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5290832","articleId":"5290958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5290959,"authors":[{"name":"Volodymyr V.

The first stage of the trigger system, the hardware-based L1 Trigger, must sift through roughly 3 terabits/second of data describing the energy distribution of particles generated in the collisions, and reduce it to 100 megabits/second of event data that subsequent systems can handle. Without the CMS Trigger, the amount of experiment-generated data would quickly outstrip the archiving ability of the LHC system. Because of the sheer amount of input data and the rate at which it is generated, the hardware-based L1 Trigger is subject to stringent performance requirements. These will become even more severe as the LHC is upgraded over the next ten years, requiring a careful redesign of the L1 Trigger hardware. For example, future upgrades may introduce particle motion-tracking data into the L1 Trigger, resulting in an increased input data rate of up to 40 terabits/second. The need to modify the design as the LHC system is upgraded, the low-volume cost advantages of FPGAs, and a desire for a flexible and adaptable system all point toward the use of FPGAs as a hardware implementation solution. In this paper, we present several different FPGA implementations of the electron/photon identification module, a key part of the new Clustering Algorithm for the upgraded L1 Trigger. We analyze the resource requirements and performance tradeoffs, and present a qualitative discussion of flexibility to meet the changing needs of the CMS experiment. Finally, we narrow potential design choices to the top candidates and use one in a full Clustering Algorithm implementation.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2009.33","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on Field Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290879/5290880/05290960.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290880","startPage":"19","endPage":"26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Design Analysis of the Clustering Algorithm for the CERN Large Hadron Collider","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5290960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Design Analysis of the Clustering Algorithm for the CERN Large Hadron Collider","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10962174","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5290960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Design Analysis of the Clustering Algorithm for the CERN Large Hadron Collider","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3716a019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066973S","chronDate":"5-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290879","isNumber":"5290880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290879","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5290880","articleId":"5290960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5290965,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Caffrey","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Caffrey","id":"37671016800"},{"name":"Keith Morgan","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Morgan","id":"37679921800"},{"name":"Diane Roussel-Dupre","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Diane","lastName":"Roussel-Dupre","id":"38274336700"},{"name":"Scott Robinson","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Robinson","id":"37399732100"},{"name":"Anthony Nelson","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Nelson","id":"38316435700"},{"name":"Anthony Salazar","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Salazar","id":"38272611100"},{"name":"Michael Wirthlin","affiliation":["NSF Center of High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wirthlin","id":"37283898600"},{"name":"William Howes","affiliation":["NSF Center of High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Howes","id":"38079203500"},{"name":"Daniel Richins","affiliation":["NSF Center of High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Richins","id":"38283078000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3716-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5290965","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":483},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Space vehicles","Single event upset","Payloads","USA Councils","Aerospace engineering","Costs","Laboratories","Satellite broadcasting","EPROM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial satellites","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-orbit flight results","reconfigurable cibola flight experiment satellite","CFESat","Los Alamos National Laboratory","FPGA-based reconfigurable computing","sensor processing application","low-earth orbit","payload","single-event upset monitoring","single-event upset mitigation","spacecraft","Xilinx Virtex FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","fault tolerant computing","configurable computing"]}],"abstract":"The Cibola Flight Experiment (CFE) is an experimental small satellite developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to demonstrate the feasibility of using FPGA-based reconfigurable computing for sensor processing in a space environment.

Increasing the size of modern SoC makes traditional approach of mapping entire design into one FPGA unsuitable. Consequently, other more appropriate scheme must be found in order to achieve optimal results. One solution for the problem could be platforms with 16 or more modern FPGAs. However, such platform verification cost would be significantly increased and most of the SoC designs would face serious issues during platform preparation if design concept is not adjusted to the specific verification process. In this paper we propose a new approach for multiple FPGA platform scheme suitable for today's rapid growth of SoC ASIC designs. The proposed approach targets the modular verification approach for pre-silicon software verification instead of using the full scale system verification process.","doi":"10.1109/ECBS-EERC.2009.10","startPage":"110","endPage":"119","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First IEEE Eastern European Conference on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290962/5290963/05290982.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 First IEEE Eastern European Conference on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECBS-EERC.2009.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Scenario Approach for Pre-Silicon Hardware/Software Co-Verification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Application specific integrated circuits","Control systems","Registers","Data processing","Software libraries","Emulation","Hardware design languages","Synchronization","Software prototyping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","program verification","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-silicon software development","SoC ASIC designs","pre-silicon hardware-software co-verification","multiple FPGA platform scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","ASIC prototyping","verification","pre-silicon","co-verification","hw/sw"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5290982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Scenario Approach for Pre-Silicon Hardware/Software Co-Verification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5290982/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10962184","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Scenario Approach for Pre-Silicon Hardware/Software Co-Verification","confLoc":"Novi Sad, Serbia","sourcePdf":"3759a110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052898S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290962","isNumber":"5290963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290962","xplore-issue":"5290963","articleId":"5290982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5291092,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Furber","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Furber","id":"37267185200"},{"name":"Andrew Brown","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Brown","id":"37277557300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3697-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4808"}],"articleNumber":"5291092","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Biology computing","Neurons","Real time systems","Concurrent computing","Embedded computing","Large-scale systems","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","microprocessor chips","neural nets","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biologically-inspired massively-parallel architectures","SpiNNaker project","parallel computer systems","million embedded processors","spiking neurons","biological neurons","fault tolerance","power efficiency","self-timed inter-chip communication system","glitch-induced deadlock","emergency hardware packet re-routing","real-time fault mitigation","functional migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massively-parallel","neural networks","fault-tolerance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291092","doi":"10.1109/ACSD.2009.17","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System Design","abstract":"The SpiNNaker project aims to develop parallel computer systems with more than a million embedded processors.

Among the sample forms that can be fitted into coaxial waveguides are (1) circular disks and (2) annular rings. The former type is sandwiched between two disjointed inner conductors of the coaxial line, whereas the latter dielectric form is snug-fitted to become the insulation layer of an intermediate coaxial section. Each type of sample requires a different coaxial configuration; this work studies both fixtures. The investigation of the first type is based on a previously studied technique that treats the sandwiched circular disk as a parallel-plate capacitor. Because of inaccuracies in the original form of that method, a modified version that offers improved accuracy is devised here. In addition, a new, independently developed technique for accurately characterizing dielectrics of the second form (annular-ring samples) using quadratic curve fitting is proposed. The experimental fixture, comprising a connected series of coaxial waveguide sections, is numerically treated with the method of moments and mode-matching technique. Details of the theoretical groundwork are presented in this paper, which constitutes the first of two parts of this work. Part II, also appearing in this issue, describes the measurement technique in detail and presents simulation results of the experimental procedure based on the formulation presented herein. In addition, the method that treats circular disks is also investigated in Part II and is used to make comparative performance studies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permittivity measurement","Coaxial components","Transmission line theory","Fixtures","Dielectric measurements","Transmission line measurements","Shape measurement","Scattering parameters","Conductors","Dielectrics and electrical insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial cables","coaxial waveguides","curve fitting","fixtures","method of moments","mode matching","permittivity measurement","S-parameters","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permittivity measurement","circular disk shaped dielectric sample","S-parameter measurement","two-port coaxial transmission line fixture","coaxial waveguide","annular ring","insulation layer","quadratic curve fitting","method of moments","mode-matching technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coaxial waveguides; mode matching; moment method; permittivity measurement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2009.5291204","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/5291200/05291204.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2009.5291204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permittivity measurement of disk and annular dielectric samples using coaxial transmission line fixtures. part I: theory and formulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Permittivity measurement of disk and annular dielectric samples using coaxial transmission line fixtures. part I: theory and formulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291204/","volume":"34","issue":"1/2","publicationDate":"Winter-Spring 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291204/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10940670","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter-Spring  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permittivity measurement of disk and annular dielectric samples using coaxial transmission line fixtures. part I: theory and formulation","sourcePdf":"1114-kehn-FINAL.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053201S","chronDate":"Winter-Spring  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"5291200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5291200","articleId":"5291204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5291209,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Though this architecture reduces cost and power consumption, it may suffer from direct current (DC) offset and frequency offset. To reduce the effect of DC offset, a frequency offset estimation scheme with a differential filter for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) direct conversion receivers has been proposed. However, the receiver may also suffer from IQ imbalance, which deteriorates the performance of frequency offset estimation. In this paper, the performance analysis of the frequency offset estimation scheme with the differential filter in the presence of IQ imbalance is derived. The numerical results obtained through computer simulations show that the derived analysis provides close approximation to the performance of the frequency offset estimation scheme. It also clarifies the dependency of the mean square error on the waveform of the preamble symbols, which is caused by IQ imbalance.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291262","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286202/5291232/05291262.pdf","startPage":"826","endPage":"831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of frequency offset estimation in the presence of IQ imbalance for OFDM direct conversion receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291262/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of frequency offset estimation in the presence of IQ imbalance for OFDM direct conversion receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940498","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291262/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of frequency offset estimation in the presence of IQ imbalance for OFDM direct conversion receivers","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043353S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286202","isNumber":"5291232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286202","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5291232","articleId":"5291262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5291263,"authors":[{"name":"Shinkai Toshiya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinkai","lastName":"Toshiya","id":"37658150800"},{"name":"Haruki Nishimura","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruki","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37600948400"},{"name":"Yukitoshi Sanada","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukitoshi","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37269451300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4560-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4561-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"5291263","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"A diversity scheme with fractional sampling (FS) in an OFDM receiver is investigated recently. Through FS, it is possible to separate multipath components and obtain diversity gain in the OFDM system. Expansion of the bandwidth of the total response including transmit and receive baseband filters allows the FS scheme to achieve path diversity. However, the transmit filter is designed according to the spectrum mask of the standards to avoid interference to the other communication systems. In order to achieve the maximum SNR, the same filter is commonly used in the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, the trade-off between the SNR deterioration and the diversity gain due to the total response larger than the minimal bandwidth is investigated. Numerical results through computer simulation indicate that BER performance with the receive filter of non-minimal bandwidth shows better performance than that with the filter for maximizing the SNR in certain conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286202/5291232/05291263.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"836","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement on diversity gain with filter bandwidth expansion in fractional sampling OFDM receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity methods","Filters","Bandwidth","Sampling methods","OFDM","Baseband","Communication standards","Interference","Transmitters","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","diversity reception","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity gain","filter bandwidth expansion","fractional sampling","OFDM receiver","multipath component","OFDM system","baseband filter","path diversity","transmit filter","spectrum mask","communication system","computer simulation","BER performance","receive filter","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improvement on diversity gain with filter bandwidth expansion in fractional sampling OFDM receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291263/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930529","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement on diversity gain with filter bandwidth expansion in fractional sampling OFDM receiver","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039794S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286202","isNumber":"5291232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286202","xplore-issue":"5291232","articleId":"5291263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5291265,"authors":[{"name":"Kiyonori Saito","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyonori","lastName":"Saito","id":"38101242000"},{"name":"Toshiya Shinkai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiya","lastName":"Shinkai","id":"37596075100"},{"name":"Haruki Nishimura","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruki","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37600948400"},{"name":"Yukitoshi Sanada","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukitoshi","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37269451300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4560-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4561-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"5291265","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Frequency response","Wireless LAN","Fading","Timing","Baseband","OFDM modulation","Diversity methods","Frequency synchronization","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio receivers","sampling methods","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling point selection","fractional sampling","OFDM receiver","IEEE802.11a","WLAN","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","OFDM modulation"]}],"abstract":"In the IEEE802.11a WLAN standard, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is employed.

The sub-channel assignment and power allocation that maximize the throughput of the system with constraints on total power usage and users' transmission rates are obtained using an intelligent search based on GA. Our version of the GA uses two chromosomes per individual - one for the channel assignment and another for the power allocation. Users' transmission rate constraints are met by awarding points to individuals who satisfy the constraints and incorporating the points into the fitness function. There is no analytical method that produces the global optimum solution to the problem on its complete form with the constraints mentioned above for us to compare our result with. However, by comparing our solutions to the existing global optimum solutions for the cases with less constraints, we show that our algorithms produce results that are within 5% of the global optimum.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291306","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286202/5291232/05291306.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291232","startPage":"571","endPage":"575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-channel and power allocation for multiuser OFDM with rate constraints using Genetic Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-channel and power allocation for multiuser OFDM with rate constraints using Genetic Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291306/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940516","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291306/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-channel and power allocation for multiuser OFDM with rate constraints using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051079S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286202","isNumber":"5291232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286202","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5291232","articleId":"5291306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5291308,"authors":[{"name":"Aissa Ikhlef","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Aissa","lastName":"Ikhlef","id":"37543201400"},{"name":"Jerome Louveaux","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Louveaux","id":"37296869400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4560-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4561-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"5291308","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":826},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Intersymbol interference","Equalizers","Transmitting antennas","Silicon carbide","Filter bank","Receiving antennas","OFDM","Interference cancellation","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","frequency selective surfaces","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["per subchannel equalization","MIMO FBMC/OQAM systems","filter bank multicarrier modulation systems","frequency selective transmission channel","intersymbol interference","intercarrier interference","MMSE equalizer","successive interference cancellation","ordered SIC techniques"]}],"abstract":"In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) filter bank multicarrier modulation (FBMC) systems, the frequency selective transmission channel causes intersymbol interference (ISI), and intercarrier interference (ICI), and using multiple antennas creates interantenna interference (IAI).

Using this technique, it is possible to keep the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the primary users above a required value and in addition to help the cognitive system by relaying signals from secondary base station to desired cognitive users. Although the proposed method needs the primary base station to be modified and to perform additional processing, it does not need any modification in the primary users and moreover, the interference induced on the primary users are controlled. In this paper, we assume that the primary base station is equipped with multiple transmit antennas. The proposed precoding scheme is based on the block diagonalization technique which removes the inter-user interference and it is combined with maximal signal to jamming plus noise ratio (SJNR) precoding method which minimizes the inter-user interference.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291232","startPage":"383","endPage":"387","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286202/5291232/05291340.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A precoding technique for joint relaying and broadcasting in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291340/","displayDocTitle":"A precoding technique for joint relaying and broadcasting in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930492","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A precoding technique for joint relaying and broadcasting in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058228S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286202","isNumber":"5291232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286202","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5291232","articleId":"5291340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5291346,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The conventional OFDMA-CDM does not effectively reduce SI, since it does not consider multiuser diversity. The proposed scheme allocates subchannels to the user who has largest minimum carrier to interference ratio (CIR) since the conventional weight combining is done by minimum channel gain. By doing the proposed subchannel allocation, minimum CIR becomes high and each user can use good subchannels. Due to the effective multiuser diversity, demodulated symbols can be weighted by high channel gain. Since the proposed scheme can generate reliable demodulated symbols, the proposed scheme can reduce SI.

To save channel bandwidth, there is strong incentive to use blind algorithms that attempt to restore properties of the transmitted digital signals. Among these, the recursive least-squares constant modulus algorithm (RLS-CMA) is of considerable interest due to its fast convergence and good interference cancellation properties. However, since a distinct copy of the RLS-CMA must be run on each individual sub-carrier in OFDM applications, this approach may entail considerable computations. In this paper, we investigate frequency interpolation schemes to reduce the computational complexity of the SIMO-OFDM beamforming system based on the RLS-CMA. These approaches, which exploit the coherence bandwidth of the broadband wireless channels, divide the subcarriers into several contiguous groups and apply the RLS-CMA to a selected subcarrier in each group; the weight vectors at other frequencies are then obtained by interpolation. We show through simulations that an M-fold reduction in complexity can be achieved where M, the number of sub-carriers in each interpolation group, depends on the characteristics of the radio channel and OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291364","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286202/5291232/05291364.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient approaches for blind adaptive beamforming in SIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291364/","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient approaches for blind adaptive beamforming in SIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940480","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291364/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient approaches for blind adaptive beamforming in SIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087947S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286202","isNumber":"5291232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286202","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5291232","articleId":"5291364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291373,"authors":[{"name":"Akihiro Yamakita","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Yamakita","id":"37706818300"},{"name":"Yuichiro Goto","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichiro","lastName":"Goto","id":"37708487800"},{"name":"Fumiaki Maehara","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiaki","lastName":"Maehara","id":"37298056500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4560-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4561-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"5291373","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","OFDM","Fading","Nonlinear distortion","Computer simulation","Transmitters","Digital video broadcasting","Peak to average power ratio","AWGN","WiMAX"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","error statistics","fading channels","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear fading channels","DBPSK/OFDM signals","bit error rate","nonlinear distortion","time selective fading effects","simple series form formula","computer simulation","input back-off","normalized maximum Doppler frequency"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a simple series form formula of the bit error rate (BER) for DBPSK/OFDM signals under time selective nonlinear fading channels.

MHPSK is a spectrally efficient modulation technique that uses four orthonormal basis functions to increase the Euclidean distance between different symbols in the signal space. The use of four orthonormal basis functions provides an advantage over traditional spectrally efficient modulation techniques such as M-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) that only possess two degrees of freedom. MHPSK offers an improvement in probability of bit error performance over other spectrally efficient modulation techniques for the same average energy per bit-to-noise power spectral density ratio and the same spectral efficiency. As a result, MHPSK offers a novel way to improve both throughput and reduce power requirements using easy to generate waveforms. MHPSK and two-subcarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with 8-PSK or 8-QAM on each subcarrier are compared in terms of the effect of peak-to-average power ratio and required amplifier backoff on the probability of bit error. In this paper, long block length Reed Solomon (RS) codes are used to encode information symbols which are then transmitted with MHPSK. Additionally, a comparison is made with two-subcarrier OFDM that uses 8-PSK or 8-QAM on each subcarrier and utilizing the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) standard rate 0.9 low density parity check (LDPC) code commonly employed in non-linear satellite communications. As such, MHPSK and two-subcarrier OFDM with 8-QAM or 8-PSK on each subcarrier are compared in terms of probability of bit error, peak-to-average power ratio, amplifier backoff, and bandwidth efficiency using long forward error correction code block lengths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-ary hyper phase-shift keying over non-linear satellite channels","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291402","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286202/5291232/05291402.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"M-ary hyper phase-shift keying over non-linear satellite channels","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291402/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940527","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-ary hyper phase-shift keying over non-linear satellite channels","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036773S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286202","isNumber":"5291232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286202","xplore-issue":"5291232","articleId":"5291402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5291404,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When we change our viewpoint to look carefully at the minimum solution to the probability estimate of the correspondences, the iterative range image registration process can also be modeled as a Markov chain in which lessons from past experience in estimating those probabilities are learned. To impose the two-way constraint, outliers are explicitly modeled due to the almost ubiquitous occurrence of occlusion, appearance, and disappearance of points in either image. The estimated probabilities of the correspondences are finally embedded into the powerful mean field annealing scheme for global optimization, leading the camera motion parameters to be estimated in the weighted least-squares sense.

The main step in this algorithm is modular exponentiation which can be done by a sequence of modular multiplication. Thus, modular multiplication is the major factor, in many cryptosystems, e.g. the RSA Two-Key system and in the proposed digital signature standard DSS. One of the most efficient algorithms of modular multiplication is the Montgomery multiplication. In this paper, modified radix-4 modular multiplication was developed based on Booth's multiplication technique. We use CSA (Carry Save Adder) to avoid carry propagation. Also a very fast algorithm was presented and used for computing the modular reduction. We proposed new hardware architecture for optimum implementation of this algorithm. According to our design, for encrypting an n-bit plaintext, we need to about 3/4n (n + 11) clock cycles. We used Xilinx VirtexII and XC4000 series FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array). As a result, it is shown that the processor can perform 1024-bit RSA operation in less than 15ms and 50ms at 54.6MHz and 16.1MHz on Xilinx VirtexII and XC4000 series FPGA, respectively. Finally we compared our results with the previous works. We can say that a significant improvement was achieved in terms of time and in terms of used time-area (TA) our work is good.","doi":"10.1109/CENICS.2009.25","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Advances in Circuits, Electronics and Micro-electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Advances in Circuits, Electronics and Micro-electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5291478/5291479/05291495.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CENICS.2009.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Speed RSA Implementation Based on Modified Booth's Technique and Montgomery's Multiplication for FPGA Platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"High Speed RSA Implementation Based on Modified Booth's Technique and Montgomery's Multiplication for FPGA Platform","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291495/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10941546","conferenceDate":"11-16 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Speed RSA Implementation Based on Modified Booth's Technique and Montgomery's Multiplication for FPGA Platform","confLoc":"Sliema, Malta","sourcePdf":"3832a086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073125S","chronDate":"11-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5291478","isNumber":"5291479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5291478","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5291479","articleId":"5291495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5291504,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Castro Lopez","affiliation":["Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Andaluc\u00c3\u00ada, ES"],"firstName":"Rafael Castro","lastName":"Lopez","id":"38082657400"},{"name":"Elisenda Roca","affiliation":["IMSE-CNM, Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain"],"firstName":"Elisenda","lastName":"Roca","id":"38329001500"},{"name":"Francisco V.

A recently proposed method to cope with the complexity of analog design is the use of a multi-objective bottom- up flow, which makes use of the concept of Pareto-optimal front (POF) to capture performance trade-offs of analog components, and through which these can be exploited during top-down design of a complex (hierarchically-wise) analog circuit. In this paper, we describe a step forward and transform this technique, through a new type of front we call Multi-Mode Pareto-optimal Front, to design reconfigurable Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). We demonstrate that not only design time is shortened but also that design complexity of reconfigurable circuits can be more systematically and efficiently managed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291504/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10941554","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using Pareto-Optimal Fronts in the Design of Reconfigurable Data Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Pareto-Optimal Fronts in the Design of Reconfigurable Data Converters","confLoc":"Sliema, Malta","sourcePdf":"3832a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087002S","chronDate":"11-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5291478","isNumber":"5291479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5291478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5291479","articleId":"5291504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5291506,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Havlicek","affiliation":["Department Microelectronics, FEEC, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Havlicek","id":"38111145700"},{"name":"Jiri Haze","affiliation":["Department Microelectronics, FEEC, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Haze","id":"37272053800"},{"name":"Jaroslav Bousek","affiliation":["Department Microelectronics, FEEC, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Bousek","id":"38111144500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3832-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5291506","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharge measurement","Partial discharges","Insulation","Pulse measurements","Transformers","Breakdown voltage","Acoustic measurements","Acoustic pulses","Switches","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulating materials","partial discharge measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude analysis","partial discharge measurement","discharge activity","unequal voltage distribution","electrical wares"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial Discharge (PD)","insulation system","high voltage (HV)","HV stress","breakdown voltage","amplitude analysis of PD","PD measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291506","abstract":"In commercial sphere, there is obvious the pursuit of produce electrical wares with high reliability and low risk of breakdown.

In this paper, finite vector lengths are considered with the vector length being viewed as an additional problem parameter. By applying the ldquosphere-packingrdquo philosophy, a lower bound to the optimal cost for this finite-length problem is derived that uses appropriate shadows of the infinite-length bounds. We also introduce lattice-based quantization strategies for any finite length. Using the new finite-length lower bound, we show that the lattice-based strategies achieve within a constant factor of the optimal cost uniformly over all possible problem parameters, including the vector length. For Witsenhausen's original problem - which corresponds to the scalar case - lattice-based strategies attain within a factor of 8 of the optimal cost. Based on observations in the scalar case and the infinite-dimensional case, we also conjecture what the optimal strategies could be for any finite vector length.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291559","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286911/5291544/05291559.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The finite-dimensional Witsenhausen counterexample","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"The finite-dimensional Witsenhausen counterexample","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291559/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10941690","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291559/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The finite-dimensional Witsenhausen counterexample","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"094paper6481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071221S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286911","isNumber":"5291544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286911","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5291544","articleId":"5291559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5291578,"authors":[{"name":"Vasaka Visoottiviseth","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Mahidol University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Vasaka","lastName":"Visoottiviseth","id":"37596400000"},{"name":"Thanakorn Piroonsith","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Thailand"],"firstName":"Thanakorn","lastName":"Piroonsith","id":"38109009700"},{"name":"Siwaruk Siwamogsatham","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Thailand"],"firstName":"Siwaruk","lastName":"Siwamogsatham","id":"37300974800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4919-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4920-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5291578","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":912},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Telecommunication traffic","Testing","Measurement","Downlink","Computer science","Pulp manufacturing","Performance analysis","Hardware","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication traffic","transport protocols","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11n devices","wireless channel","UDP traffic","TCP traffic","frame aggregation mechanism","block acknowledgement mechanism","wireless LAN","frequency 20 MHz","frequency 40 MHz"]}],"abstract":"The empirical performance studies on the emerging IEEE 802.11n technology by an independent and vendor-neutral party have not really been explored. In this paper, we conduct performance measurements for the IEEE 802.11n network using a mixture of commercially available IEEE 802.11n devices from various manufacturers. With the same standard 20-MHz channel width configuration, the results demonstrate that IEEE 802.11n significantly outperforms the IEEE 802.11g network. The performance improvements of IEEE 802.11n are measured to be roughly about 85% for the downlink UDP traffic, 68% for the downlink TCP traffic, 50% for the uplink UDP traffic, and 90% for the uplink TCP traffic. We also observe that the UDP throughputs are largely imbalanced for the uplink and downlink traffics in most test networks, while the downlink and uplink TCP throughput results are quite balanced for all test networks. In addition, the 40-MHz channel configurations only provide marginal performance improvements. Unlike other existing work, here we also capture and analyze the IEEE 802.11n packets transferred during the performance tests in order to technically explain the measured performance results. It is observed that when the frame aggregation and block acknowledgement mechanisms are utilized, the superior performance results are achieved. However, the decisions on how and when to use these mechanisms are very hardware dependent.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291578","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286911/5291544/05291578.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical study on achievable throughputs of IEEE 802.11n devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291578/","displayDocTitle":"An empirical study on achievable throughputs of IEEE 802.11n devices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10941705","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291578/","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical study on achievable throughputs of IEEE 802.11n devices","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"088paper6314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.334112S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286911","isNumber":"5291544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286911","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5291544","articleId":"5291578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5291586,"authors":[{"name":"Sreenath Ramanath","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Sreenath","lastName":"Ramanath","id":"37400302000"},{"name":"Eitan Altman","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Altman","id":"37266347900"},{"name":"Vinod Kumar","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Vinod","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292752300"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Supelec, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4919-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4920-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5291586","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291586","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency","Wireless networks","Power system modeling","Matched filters","Detectors","Base stations","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["picocellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pico-cell wireless networks","cell size optimisation","fluid models","base station","path loss factor","spatial reuse factor","discrete system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular networks","Pico-cell networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291586","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286911/5291544/05291586.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing cell size in Pico-cell networks","abstract":"In this paper, we present a systematic study of the uplink capacity and coverage of pico-cell wireless networks.

As the beamforming vector control criterion, we employ the maximization of so-called signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) at each base station, which enable us to obtain closed form beamforming vector by using only locally available information. We also discuss the local optimality of the SLNR based beamforming vector. As for the subcarrier power allocation, two different approaches are employed, namely, the equalization of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for subcarriers and the maximization of sum rate of subcarriers. Computer simulation results show the validity of the transmit beamforming and power allocation method with highlighting the difference between the two power allocation algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286911/5291544/05291589.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beamforming and power allocation for downlink OFDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Downlink","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile communication","Frequency conversion","Computer simulation","OFDM","Interchannel interference","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit beamforming","subcarrier power allocation","downlink OFDMA systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","beamforming vector control criterion","so-called signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","transmit beamforming","power allocation","iterative water-filling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming and power allocation for downlink OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291589/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10941716","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming and power allocation for downlink OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"065paper6490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078007S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286911","isNumber":"5291544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286911","xplore-issue":"5291544","articleId":"5291589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291595,"authors":[{"name":"Keigo Takeuchi","affiliation":["Department Information & Communication Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keigo","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37391081600"},{"name":"Ralf R.

While existing physical layer security literature answered the question ldquowhat are the link-level secrecy capacity gains from cooperation?rdquo, this paper attempts to answer the question of ldquohow to achieve those gains in a practical decentralized wireless network and in the presence of a secrecy capacity cost for information exchange?rdquo. For this purpose, we model the physical layer security cooperation problem as a coalitional game with non-transferable utility and propose a distributed algorithm for coalition formation. Through the proposed algorithm, the wireless users can autonomously cooperate and self-organize into disjoint independent coalitions, while maximizing their secrecy capacity taking into account the security costs during information exchange. We analyze the resulting coalitional structures, discuss their properties, and study how the users can self-adapt the network topology to environmental changes such as mobility. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows the users to cooperate and self-organize while improving the average secrecy capacity per user up to 25.32% relative to the non-cooperative case.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291619","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286911/5291544/05291619.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291619","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical layer security: Coalitional games for distributed cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer security: Coalitional games for distributed cooperation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291619/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291619/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10941746","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer security: Coalitional games for distributed cooperation","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"029paper6322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100829S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286911","isNumber":"5291544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286911","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5291544","articleId":"5291619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291623,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Kin Chau","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK","EE Department, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Chi-Kin","lastName":"Chau","id":"38556639900"},{"name":"Muhammad Husni Wahab","affiliation":["EE Department, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Muhammad Husni","lastName":"Wahab","id":"37547714400"},{"name":"Fei Qin","affiliation":["EE Department, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Qin","id":"37544989200"},{"name":"Yunsheng Wang","affiliation":["EE Department, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Yunsheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38559421200"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["EE Department, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292959400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4919-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4920-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5291623","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291623","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Radio frequency","Transceivers","Runtime","Reservoirs","Algorithm design and analysis","Protocols","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","random processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery recovery aware sensor network","energy optimisation","nonideal energy reservoir","random sensing activity","Markov chain model","energy-efficient duty cycling scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor Networks","Energy Efficiency","Battery Recovery","Duty Cycling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291623","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286911/5291544/05291623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Battery recovery aware sensor networks","abstract":"Many applications of sensor networks require batteries as the energy source, and hence critically rely on energy optimisation of sensor batteries. But as often neglected by the networking community, most batteries are non-ideal energy reservoirs and can exhibit battery recovery effect - the deliverable energy in batteries can be replenished per se, if left idling for sufficient duration. We made several contributions towards harnessing battery recovery effect in sensor networks. First, we empirically examine the gain of battery runtime due to battery recovery effect, and found this effect significant and duration-dependent. Second, based on our findings, we model the battery recovery effect in the presence of random sensing activities by a Markov chain model, and study the effect of duty cycling and buffering to harness battery recovery effect. Third, we propose a more energy-efficient duty cycling scheme that is aware of battery recovery effect, and analyse its performance with respect to the latency of data delivery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291623/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10941750","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291623/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Battery recovery aware sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery recovery aware sensor networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"033paper6399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058158S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286911","isNumber":"5291544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286911","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5291544","articleId":"5291623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291642,"authors":[{"name":"Kwanghun Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, South Korea","School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kwanghun","lastName":"Han","id":"37536189000"},{"name":"Youngkyu Choi","affiliation":["WiMAX System Lab, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngkyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37403164400"},{"name":"Dongmyoung Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, South Korea","School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dongmyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37655653400"},{"name":"Minsoo Na","affiliation":["Institute of Network Technoloy, SK Telecom, Sungnam, Korea"],"firstName":"Minsoo","lastName":"Na","id":"38095514300"},{"name":"Sunghyun Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, South Korea","School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghyun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37279913300"},{"name":"Kiyoung Han","affiliation":["Communication Lab, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kiyoung","lastName":"Han","id":"37557259000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4919-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4920-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5291642","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":885},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Femtocell networks","Interference constraints","Macrocell networks","Frequency","Base stations","Indoor environments","Interchannel interference","Communication system control","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","indoor radio","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell network configuration optimization","co-channel interference constraint","femto base station","indoor environment","macrocell network","frequency channel","mixed integer programming"]}],"abstract":"Femto BS (base station) is emerging as a key technology to secure the coverage and capacity in indoor environments. However, since the existing macrocell network is overlaid on femtocell networks utilizing the same set of frequency channels, femtocell networks can originate severe co-channel interference to the macrocell network unless the femtocell network is carefully configured. Therefore, according to a desired network-wide objective, we optimize the femtocell network with constraints such that the service connectivity with a femto BS is secured in the target indoor area while the signal emitted out of the building, playing as interference to the outdoor users, should be controlled with an appropriate strength in order not to interrupt the communication between macro BS and outdoor users. Each optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming, and as the results, we obtain not only the transmit power and operational frequency channel of each femto BS, but also the optimal femto BS-to-user association pair at each geographical position.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291642","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286911/5291544/05291642.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291544","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of femtocell network configuration under interference constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of femtocell network configuration under interference constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291642/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10941769","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291642/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of femtocell network configuration under interference constraints","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"020paper6359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06452S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286911","isNumber":"5291544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286911","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5291544","articleId":"5291642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291646,"authors":[{"name":"Kaibin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kaibin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37290266200"},{"name":"Vincent K.

This paper addresses spectrum sharing between a cellular uplink and a mobile ad hoc networks. These networks use either all uplink frequency subchannels or their disjoint subsets, called spectrum underlay and spectrum overlay, respectively. Given these methods, the capacity tradeoff between the coexisting networks is analyzed in terms of transmission capacity. For a network with Poisson distributed transmitters, this metric is defined as the maximum density of transmitters subject to an outage constraint for a given signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Using stochastic geometry, the transmission-capacity tradeoff between the coexisting networks is derived, where both spectrum overlay and underlay as well as successive interference cancellation (SIC) are considered. In particular, for small target outage probability, the transmission capacities of the coexisting networks are proved to satisfy a linear equation. Its coefficients depend on the spectrum sharing method and whether SIC is applied. This linear equation shows that spectrum overlay is more efficient than spectrum underlay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291646/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10941773","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291646/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing between cellular and mobile ad hoc networks: Transmission-capacity tradeoff","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing between cellular and mobile ad hoc networks: Transmission-capacity tradeoff","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"024paper6340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073923S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286911","isNumber":"5291544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286911","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5291544","articleId":"5291646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291686,"authors":[{"name":"Ingvar Gustavsson","affiliation":["ING-AET, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Ronneby, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/5370793/5291686/5291686-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ingvar Gustavsson received the MSEE and Dr Sc degrees from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, in 1967 and 1974, respectively.

Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH) in Sweden and the University of South Australia (UniSA) have created online laboratory workbenches for electrical experiments that mimic traditional ones by combining virtual and physical reality. Online workbenches not only supplement traditional ones, but they can also be used for low-cost individual assessment. BTH has started a project disseminating the BTH workbench concept, The Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR) Open Laboratory Platform, and invites other universities to set up replicas and participate in further development and standardization. Further, online workbenches offer additional learning possibilities. UniSA has started a project where students located in different countries can perform experiments together as a way to enhance the participants' intercultural competence.

They jointly worked on the PEARL project (http://iet.open.ac.uk/pearl/) from 2000 to 2003 and have worked on further projects within their own institutions (the Open University, United Kingdom, and the University of Porto, Portugal, respectively) since then. The paper begins with a statement of the rationale for remote experiments, then offers a review of past work of the authors and highlights the key lessons for remote labs drawn from this. These lessons include (1) the importance of removing accessibility barriers, (2) the importance of a pedagogic strategy, (3) evaluation of pedagogic effectiveness, (4) the ease of automation or remote control, and (5) learning objectives and design decisions. The paper then discusses key topics including assessment issues, instructional design, pedagogical strategies, relations to industry, and cost benefits. A conclusion summarizes key points from the paper within a review of the current status of remote labs in education.","doi":"10.1109/TLT.2009.43","startPage":"342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620076/5370793/05291687.pdf","endPage":"353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5370793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2009.43","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291687/","displayDocTitle":"Remote Laboratories Extending Access to Science and Engineering Curricular","volume":"2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291687/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11049950","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Remote Laboratories Extending Access to Science and Engineering Curricular","sourcePdf":"tlt2009040342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072261S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"5370793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5370793","articleId":"5291687","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5291691,"authors":[{"name":"Clemens Moser","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5420340/5291691/5291691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Clemens Moser received the BSc and Diplom-Ingenieur degrees in electrical engineering and information technology from the Technical University of Munich, in 2003 and 2004, respectively and the PhD degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in March 2009.

In contrast to approaches that minimize the power consumption subject to performance constraints, we are concerned with optimizing the performance of an application while respecting the limited and time-varying amount of available power. In this paper, we address power management of, e.g., wireless sensor nodes which receive their energy from solar cells. Based on a prediction of the future available energy, we adapt parameters of the application in order to maximize the utility in a long-term perspective. The paper presents a formal model of the corresponding optimization problem including constraints concerning buffer sizes, timing, and rates. Instead of solving the optimization problem online which may be prohibitively complex in terms of running time and energy consumption, we apply multiparametric programming to precompute the application parameters offline for different environmental conditions and system states. In order to guarantee sustainable operation, we propose a hierarchical software design which comprises a worst-case prediction of the incoming energy. As a further contribution, we suggest a new method for approximate multiparametric linear programming which substantially lowers the computational demand and memory requirement of the embedded software. Our approaches are evaluated using long-term measurements of solar energy in an outdoor environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","volume":"59","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11152611","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291691/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Power Management for Environmentally Powered Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Power Management for Environmentally Powered Systems","sourcePdf":"ttc2010040478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126605S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5420340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5420340","articleId":"5291691","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5291695,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanouil M.

The underlying problem with SRAM is that there are conflicting requirements for read stability and writeability, such that optimizing the cell for read stability degrades its writeability. In this work, we present a circuit-architecture co-design technique that allows the decoupling of these conflicting requirements, resulting in significant yield enhancement at iso-area, while being scalable. Our technique is based on the observation that the write operation is not as performance critical as the read operation in high-performance microprocessors. Thus, the technique skews the cell design towards improving read stability at the circuit level at the expense of writeability. To handle the increased write failures in some dies, we apply simple architectural modifications that allow the write operation to take an additional cycle (stretched write cycle). By using our technique, we can improve yield from 37% to 69%, while having 3.4% performance impact on average, without increasing the size of the SRAM cell.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2022628","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","startPage":"1209","endPage":"1219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5518454/05291698.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2022628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Circuit-Architecture Co-Design to Improve Memory Yield for High-Performance Processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Circuit stability","Microprocessors","Resource description framework","Logic design","Design optimization","Degradation","Read-write memory","Lithography","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory architecture","microprocessor chips","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable circuit-architecture codesign","SRAM","memory yield","read stability","writeability","high-performance microprocessors","cell design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Architecture","circuit","decouple read stability and writeability","SRAM","yield"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Circuit-Architecture Co-Design to Improve Memory Yield for High-Performance Processors","volume":"18","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11433029","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5291698/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291698/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Circuit-Architecture Co-Design to Improve Memory Yield for High-Performance Processors","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pndai-2022628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056961S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5518454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5518454","articleId":"5291698","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291701,"authors":[{"name":"Swaroop Ghosh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5556483/5291701/5291701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Swaroop Ghosh received the B.E. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India, in 2000, the M.S. degree from the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.","He is a Senior Design Engineer in the Advanced Memory Design Group, Intel, Hillsboro, OR.

We employed three separate studies, each utilizing a different continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, to verify the model's universality. Two out of the three studies involved subjects with type 1 diabetes and the other one with type 2 diabetes. We first filtered the subcutaneous glucose concentration data by imposing constraints on their rate of change. Then, using the filtered data, we developed data-driven autoregressive models of order 30, and used them to make short-term, 30-min-ahead glucose-concentration predictions. We used same-subject model predictions as a reference for comparisons against cross-subject and cross-study model predictions, which were evaluated using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and Clarke error grid analysis (EGA). We found that, for each studied subject, the average cross-subject and cross-study RMSEs of the predictions were small and indistinguishable from those obtained with the same-subject models. These observations were corroborated by EGA, where better than 99.0% of the paired sensor-predicted glucose concentrations lay in the clinically acceptable zone A. In addition, the predictive capability of the models was found not to be affected by diabetes type, subject age, CGM device, and interindividual differences. We conclude that it is feasible to develop universal glucose models that allow for clinical use of predictive algorithms and CGM devices for proactive therapy of diabetic patients.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal Glucose Models for Predicting Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Humans","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2034141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5382610/05291722.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2034141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Universal Glucose Models for Predicting Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Humans","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5291722/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070575","pubMedId":"19858035","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal Glucose Models for Predicting Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Humans","sourcePdf":"titb-reifman-2034141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073683S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5382610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5382610","articleId":"5291722","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5291723,"authors":[{"name":"Juan M.

In this paper, a novel emotion evocation and EEG-based feature extraction technique is presented. In particular, the mirror neuron system concept was adapted to efficiently foster emotion induction by the process of imitation. In addition, higher order crossings (HOC) analysis was employed for the feature extraction scheme and a robust classification method, namely HOC-emotion classifier (HOC-EC), was implemented testing four different classifiers [quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbor, Mahalanobis distance, and support vector machines (SVMs)], in order to accomplish efficient emotion recognition. Through a series of facial expression image projection, EEG data have been collected by 16 healthy subjects using only 3 EEG channels, namely Fp1, Fp2, and a bipolar channel of F3 and F4 positions according to 10-20 system. Two scenarios were examined using EEG data from a single-channel and from combined-channels, respectively. Compared with other feature extraction methods, HOC-EC appears to outperform them, achieving a 62.3% (using QDA) and 83.33% (using SVM) classification accuracy for the single-channel and combined-channel cases, respectively, differentiating among the six basic emotions, i.e., happiness , surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. As the emotion class-set reduces its dimension, the HOC-EC converges toward maximum classification rate (100% for five or less emotions), justifying the efficiency of the proposed approach. This could facilitate the integration of HOC-EC in human machine interfaces, such as pervasive healthcare systems, enhancing their affective character and providing information about the user's emotional status (e.g., identifying user's emotion experiences, recurring affective states, time-dependent emotional trends).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","volume":"14","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11171951","pubMedId":"19858033","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5291724/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Emotion Recognition From EEG Using Higher Order Crossings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion Recognition From EEG Using Higher Order Crossings","sourcePdf":"titb-hadjileontiadis-2034649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140676S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5431105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"357","xplore-issue":"5431105","articleId":"5291724","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5291727,"authors":[{"name":"C.

As a limiting effect, the amplified Rayleigh backscattering in the highly nonlinear fiber is identified when the regenerator is passed multiple times.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2009.2034539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2009.2034539","startPage":"1864","endPage":"1866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/5339268/05291727.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Phase Noise Reduction in a DPSK Transmission System Using Cascaded Nonlinear Amplifying Loop Mirrors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Phase Noise Reduction in a DPSK Transmission System Using Cascaded Nonlinear Amplifying Loop Mirrors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","volume":"21","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291727/","accessionNumber":"11002196","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291727/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Phase Noise Reduction in a DPSK Transmission System Using Cascaded Nonlinear Amplifying Loop Mirrors","sourcePdf":"lpt-gonishchukov-2034539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057999S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5339268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5339268","articleId":"5291727","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5291752,"authors":[{"name":"Constantinos S.

First, we discuss the principle of the one-active LASAR and demonstrate its feasibility by experiment. To describe the 3D spatial resolution of the one-active LASAR, the relationship between the 3D ambiguity function (AF) of the one-active LASAR and the system parameters is discussed in detail. Based on the analysis, we divide the APCT design into three topics: the direction of the linear array, the length of the linear array, and the switching mode of the active element [named as antenna phase center function (APCF)]. On the first topic, we conclude that, when the range, along-track, and cross-track directions are orthogonal to each other, the ambiguity region of the one-active LASAR attains minimum, and the 3D spatial resolution can be separated into the range, along-track, and cross-track resolutions. On the second topic, we find that the cross-track resolution is determined by the length of the linear array and the frequency of the carrier. To ensure that the length of the linear array is acceptable, the carrier should be W-band wave or millimeter wave. On the third topic, the effect of APCF is researched, and we find that both the periodic APCF and the pseudorandom APCF can produce 3D resolution, except for the periodic rectangle APCF. For the pseudorandom APCF and the periodic APCF with short period, the cross-range 2D AF is or can be approximated as the product of two 1D AFs in the along- and cross-track directions. Finally, the distribution of the pseudorandom APCF is optimized by the Lagrange multiplier method under the minimum variance criterion, and we find that, when the pseudorandom APCF obeys the parabolic distribution, the cross-range 2D AF is optimal.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031430","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1486","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416603/05291764.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"APC Trajectory Design for \u201cOne-Active\u201d Linear-Array Three-Dimensional Imaging SAR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"APC Trajectory Design for \u201cOne-Active\u201d Linear-Array Three-Dimensional Imaging SAR","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291764/","accessionNumber":"11138148","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291764/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"APC Trajectory Design for \u201cOne-Active\u201d Linear-Array Three-Dimensional Imaging SAR","sourcePdf":"tgrs-jun-2031430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102553S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5416603","articleId":"5291764","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5291767,"authors":[{"name":"Jianzhong Zhang","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center for Motion Control, Ministry of Education, School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5336283/5291767/5291767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianzhong Zhang (M'08) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","From November 2006 to November 2007, he was a Visiting Scholar in the Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, where he worked on the permanent-magnet generator for wind power application.

The first numerical method is based on computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) and the second one uses a thermal equivalent circuit (TEC). For the analysis based on CFD, a 3-D induction machine including housing is modeled. The numeric solution of the flow equations is determined for stationary temperature distributions. For the TEC, a discretized one-and-a-half-dimensional model of the induction machine is considered. With the TEC model, stationary and transient operating conditions can be simulated. Measurement results are determined by iron-copper-nickel sensors embedded in the stator winding and the housing, as well as by an IR sensor for measuring the rotor temperature. With these measurement signals, stationary and transient operating conditions can be analyzed. For stationary operating conditions, additionally, the housing temperatures are determined by an IR camera. The investigated simulation and measurement methods reveal different local and global temperatures, and thus, only certain aspects and characteristics of the obtained temperatures can be compared. Nevertheless, certain conclusions can be drawn from comparing these aspects considering the actual restrictions of each of the applied methods.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2025428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5336283/05291771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2025428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336283","startPage":"809","endPage":"818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of a CFD Analysis and a Thermal Equivalent Circuit Model of a TEFC Induction Machine With Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of a CFD Analysis and a Thermal Equivalent Circuit Model of a TEFC Induction Machine With Measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985620","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291771/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of a CFD Analysis and a Thermal Equivalent Circuit Model of a TEFC Induction Machine With Measurements","sourcePdf":"tec-kral-2025428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128989S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5336283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5336283","articleId":"5291771","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5291772,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37399191900"},{"name":"Bing Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Sun","id":"37396937400"},{"name":"Haowei Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haowei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406825800"},{"name":"Lifeng Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406794700"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280578200"},{"name":"Ruqi Han","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruqi","lastName":"Han","id":"37279237900"},{"name":"Jinfeng Kang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinfeng","lastName":"Kang","id":"37273713100"},{"name":"Bin Yu","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, State University of New York, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37535092700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5291772","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":149,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2490},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291772","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrons","Random access memory","Predictive models","Low voltage","Scalability","Microelectronics","Dielectric devices","Spontaneous emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","hopping conduction","random-access storage","vacancies (crystal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar oxide-based resistive switching memory","metal-oxide-based resistive random access memory devices","electron hopping transport","dielectric layer","low-electron-occupied region","conductive filament","oxygen vacancies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conductive filament (CF)","nonvolatile memory","oxygen vacancy","resistive switching"]}],"abstract":"A unified model is proposed to elucidate the resistive switching behavior of metal-oxide-based resistive random access memory devices using the concept of electron hopping transport along filamentary conducting paths in dielectric layer.

One quantity will be distilled from the coupling matrix to characterize the synchronizability of the corresponding dynamical networks. The calculation of such a quantity is very convenient even for large-scale networks. The network topology is assumed to be directed and weakly connected, which implies that the coupling configuration matrix can be asymmetric, weighted, or reducible. This assumption is more consistent with the realistic network in practice than the constraint of symmetry and irreducibility. By using the Lyapunov functional method and the Kronecker product techniques, some criteria are obtained to guarantee the globally exponential synchronization of general dynamical networks. In addition, numerical examples, including small-world and scale-free networks, are given to demonstrate the theoretical results.

With a filtering signal transfer function (STF) and stopband attenuation greater than 30 dB, the DeltaSigma modulator reduces the intermodulation of the desired signal and the interfering signals at the input of a quantizer, and also avoids feedback of high-frequency interfering signals at the input of the modulator. This filtering of the interfering signals reduces sensitivity to DAC nonlinearities. The reported DT complex DeltaSigma ADC is intended for digital television (DTV) receiver applications. With a maximum intended sampling frequency of 128 MHz and an oversampling ratio of 16, the ADC has been designed to support a maximum DTV signal bandwidth of 8 MHz. The IC achieved a 70.9-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio over a 6-MHz band centered around 3 MHz. The image-rejection ratio of the DeltaSigma ADC was measured to be greater than 65 dB.

The proposed converter utilizes a multiwinding coupled inductor and a voltage doubler to achieve high step-up voltage gain. The voltage on the active switch is clamped, and the energy stored in the leakage inductor is recycled. Therefore, the voltage stress on the active switch is reduced, and the conversion efficiency is improved. Finally, a 750-W laboratory prototype converter supplied by a proton exchange membrane fuel cell power source and an output voltage of 400 V is implemented. The experimental results verify the performances, including high voltage gain, high conversion efficiency, and the effective suppression of the voltage stress on power devices. The proposed high step-up converter can feasibly be used for low-input-voltage fuel cell power conversion applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel High Step-Up DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cell Energy Conversion System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2026364","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5463268/05291789.pdf","startPage":"2007","endPage":"2017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Novel High Step-Up DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cell Energy Conversion System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5291789/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11286113","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel High Step-Up DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cell Energy Conversion System","sourcePdf":"tie-changchien-2026364.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079254S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5463268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"244","xplore-issue":"5463268","articleId":"5291789","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5291795,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yao","id":"37280661000"},{"name":"Nawwaf Kharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Nawwaf","lastName":"Kharma","id":"37275640100"},{"name":"Peter Grogono","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Grogono","id":"37269281900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5291795","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1134},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper describes the latest version of a bi-objective multipopulation genetic algorithm (BMPGA) aiming to locate all global and local optima on a real-valued differentiable multimodal landscape. The performance of BMPGA is compared against four multimodal GAs on five multimodal functions. BMPGA is distinguished by its use of two separate but complementary fitness objectives designed to enhance the diversity of the overall population and exploration of the search space. This is coupled with a multipopulation and clustering scheme, which focuses selection within the various sub-populations and results in effective identification and retention of the optima of the target functions as well as improved exploitation within promising areas. The results of the empirical comparison provide clear evidence that supports the conclusion that BMPGA is better than the other GAs in terms of overall effectiveness, applicability, and reliability. The practical value of BMPGA has already been demonstrated in applications to multiple ellipses and elliptic objects detection in microscopic imagery.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5401131/05291795.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2009.2017517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2009.2017517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-Objective Multipopulation Genetic Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Pattern matching","Focusing","Object detection","Microscopy","Pattern recognition","Path planning","Mobile robots","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bi-objective multipopulation genetic algorithm","multimodal function optimization","global optima","local optima","real-valued differentiable multimodal landscape","search space","clustering","multiple ellipses","elliptic objects detection","microscopic imagery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bi-objective multipopulation GA","genetic algorithms","multimodal optimization","recursive middling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bi-Objective Multipopulation Genetic Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5291795/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11088365","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Objective Multipopulation Genetic Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-jyao-2017517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075225S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5401131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5401131","articleId":"5291795","onlineDate":"23 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5291796,"authors":[{"name":"Banu Soylu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5438925/5291796/5291796-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Banu Soylu received the B.Sc.

The power of Gabor lays in its properties like the computation of local structure corresponding to different spatial frequency (scale), spatial localization, orientations and inessentiality of manual annotations. This work, an ensemble based Gabor nearest neighbor classifier (EGNNC), extends the Gabor nearest neighbor classifier (GNNC), which extracts important discriminative features utilizing both the Gabor filter and nearest neighbor discriminant analysis (NNDA). EGNNC is an ensemble classifier combining multiple NNDA based component classifiers which are designed using different segments of the reduced Gabor features. EGNNC has better use of the discriminability implied in reduced Gabor features by avoiding 3S (small sample size) problem in contrast to GNNC, since GNNC operates on the whole Gabor feature space and reduces the dimension by one component NNDA.

We have extracted the computable audio-visual features from the movie clips which are inspired by the techniques and film grammars used by many filmmakers to endow specific characteristics to a genre. The extracted visual features are shot length, motion, color dominance and lighting key and the extracted audio features are based on time domain, pitch, frequency domain, energy and MFCC. Movie classifier is designed using feed forward neural network with back propagation learning algorithm.

For accurate and proper spectrum management, we propose a spectrum decision algorithm for spectrum brokers, which takes user type and spectrum channel properties into consideration. This approach increases both the number of users that can get proper spectrum bands and the throughput of the system. The algorithm also includes a \"patience\" option. Users that choose the \"patience\" option agree to wait for a predetermined amount of time until their connection is established. Meanwhile, a better spectrum may become available. This option increases the efficiency of spectrum usage too.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291799","startPage":"697","endPage":"702","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 24th International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5287478/5291799/05291908.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic spectrum decision scheme for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5291908/","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic spectrum decision scheme for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940802","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic spectrum decision scheme for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Guzelyurt, Northern Cyprus","sourcePdf":"Paper123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060406S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5287478","isNumber":"5291799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5287478","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5291799","articleId":"5291908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291909,"authors":[{"name":"Ceren Mazici","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ceren","lastName":"Mazici","id":"38111152900"},{"name":"Feza Buzluca","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Feza","lastName":"Buzluca","id":"37316943000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5021-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5023-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5291909","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio control","Cognitive radio","Personal digital assistants","Computer networks","Transceivers","Media Access Protocol","Communication system control","Frequency","Token networks","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["token-based control channel protocol","cognitive radio networks","medium access layer","primary users","secondary users","MAC layer","carrier sensing methods","spectrum decision process","CSMA-CA protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","cognitive radio","control channel","token ring"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, the main purpose of medium access layer is to make optimum decisions for efficient usage of spectrum which is scarcely used by primary users. In addition to primary users (PUs), secondary users (SUs) have to share the spectrum with each other by exchanging information over a control channel. Therefore, control channel has vital importance on MAC layer. When there is a significant number of SUs in the network, this control channel becomes saturated because of the increasing number of channel requests and control information. In this paper, we propose a token ring based solution for the control channel to limit the response delay; thus prevent excess waiting time which happens with carrier sensing methods even though there are available licensed channels. The protocol proposed also improves the quality of the spectrum decision process, because the necessary global information about the state of channels is carried inside the token. The protocol was compared with a CSMA/CA protocol and gained better results in response delay and utilization.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291909","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 24th International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5287478/5291799/05291909.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291909","publicationTitle":"2009 24th International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","startPage":"703","endPage":"708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A token based control channel protocol for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A token based control channel protocol for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291909/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5291909/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940803","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A token based control channel protocol for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Guzelyurt, Northern Cyprus","sourcePdf":"Paper124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046441S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5287478","isNumber":"5291799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5287478","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5291799","articleId":"5291909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5291946,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Kimachi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Informatics, Faculty of Information and Communication Engineering, Osaka Electro Communication University, Neyagawa, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5290388/5291946/5291946-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Akira Kimachi (M'02) received the B.E., M.E., and Dr. Engr. degrees in mathematical engineering and information physics from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1993, 1995, and 1999, respectively.","From 1999 to 2001, he worked for the Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo.

The PSRF consists of a time-domain correlation image sensor (CIS) proposed by us, a scanning sheet of light (SOL), and three-phase reference signals supplied to the CIS. After the SOL was scanned over the object during a frame period, the CIS records the ldquophase stamprdquo of the reference signals at the moment when the SOL reflected on the object arrived at each pixel. The range image is then reconstructed at the frame rate by converting the phase stamp image from the CIS pixel-wise to the projection angle of the SOL and then applying triangulation. An experimental system is constructed with a 200 times 200-pixel CIS camera and a light-sectioning laser projection system. Experimental results confirm that the constructed system outputs range images at 12.5 frames/s, achieves measurement accuracy of less than 1 mm in standard deviation for imaging distance of 300-500 mm, and is robust to time-varying, spatially nonuniform ambient illumination and fine surface texture of objects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5290388/05291946.pdf","startPage":"1784","endPage":"1792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2031228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2031228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290388","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Phase-Stamp Range Finder Using Correlation Image Sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Computational Intelligence Society","Time domain analysis","Image reconstruction","Image converters","Pixel","Cameras","Measurement standards","Robustness","Time varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image sensors","laser ranging","object detection","optical correlation","real-time systems","surface texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time phase-stamp range finder","time-domain correlation image sensor","real-time three-dimensional imaging","3D imaging","scanning sheet-of-light","light reflection","image reconstruction","triangulation","light-sectioning laser projection system","distance measurement","spatially nonuniform ambient illumination","surface texture","picture size 200 pixel","distance 300 mm to 500 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlation image sensor","light sectioning","phase-stamp imaging","real-time range finder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Phase-Stamp Range Finder Using Correlation Image Sensor","volume":"9","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5291946/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10950116","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Phase-Stamp Range Finder Using Correlation Image Sensor","sourcePdf":"jsen-kimachi-2031228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074821S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5290388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5290388","articleId":"5291946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5291973,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung-Kew Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5290388/5291973/5291973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyung-Kew Lee received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 1996 and 1999, respectively.

The sensor consists of a mechanical structure based on PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) and a mesh of multiple copper electrode strips. The mesh is composed of 16 top and 16 bottom copper strips crossed each other to form a 16 times 16 capacitor array. The proposed sensor is able to switch its function from tactile sensing to proximity sensing or vice versa by reconfiguring the connection of electrodes. The tactile sensing capability has been demonstrated already and reported in our previous paper (Lee et al.,, 2006); therefore, in this paper, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the proximity sensing capability and the dual-mode operation of the proposed sensor in detail. The capacitance change caused by an approaching object has been estimated through simulation of multiple two-dimensional models as an initial study. The measured data have shown similar trends with the simulation results. We tested various materials from conducting metals to a human hand for proximity measurement.

The optical amplitudes of two lasers with chaotic oscillations induced by optical feedback are each sampled at a fixed rate to extract binary bit sequences which are then combined by an exclusive-OR operation to obtain a single random bit sequence. Bit sequences generated at rate of 1 Giga bit per second are verified to pass statistical tests of randomness. We describe the dependence of randomness on laser parameters, in particular the injection current, the external cavity length and the feedback strength. The results provide clear empirical guidelines for tuning the chaotic laser parameters to achieve random bit sequences. This study shows that chaotic laser devices can be fast and reliable sources of physical entropy for computing and communication applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/5284323/05291985.pdf","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2009.2031310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2009.2031310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5284323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5291985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of Fast Physical Random Bit Generation Using Chaotic Semiconductor Lasers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character generation","Chaos","Laser theory","Semiconductor lasers","Laser feedback","Chaotic communication","Laser tuning","Optical feedback","Testing","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser feedback","laser tuning","optical chaos","random number generation","random sequences","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast random bit generation","chaotic semiconductor lasers","chaotic oscillations","optical feedback","binary bit sequences","statistical randomness. tests","injection current","external cavity length","tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos","information technology","random number generation","semiconductor laser"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5291985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of Fast Physical Random Bit Generation Using Chaotic Semiconductor Lasers","volume":"45","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5291985/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10974024","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of Fast Physical Random Bit Generation Using Chaotic Semiconductor Lasers","sourcePdf":"jqe-auchida-2031310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093158S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5284323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5284323","articleId":"5291985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5292050,"authors":[{"name":"Guzm\u00c1n Diaz","affiliation":["University of Oviedo, Vieques, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Guzm\u00e1n D\u00edaz (M'04) received the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain, in 1993 and 2001, respectively, both in electrical engineering.","Presently, he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Oviedo.

The methodology is based on finding the worst primary reserve share-that is, the share closest to instability-that can be found after rescheduling the droops of selected generating units that support frequency (and voltage) regulation. The solution-which consists of a measure of the distance to instability in a given direction-is found in a multi-parameter space endowed with coordinates corresponding to the droop coefficients. Two stages are proposed to achieve the solution. First, an investigation of the distance to bifurcation is computed in a one-dimensional parameter space in a defined search direction. Then the direction of this search is updated by calculating the normal vector at the found bifurcation point. The procedure is iteratively repeated until the closest bifurcation is found. The proposed approach is analyzed in a 69-bus and 11-generation unit isolated microgrid. It is shown through the analysis of some scenarios how the distances and normal vectors provide valuable insight on the correct scheduling from the stability point of view, giving advice on how the primary reserve should be more reliably scheduled.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

Replacement signals from observers are used to reconfigure the drive and re-enter closed loop control.

The approach consists on obtaining a 2D time frequency plot representing the time-frequency evolution of all the harmonics present on an electric machine transient current. Identifying characteristic patterns in the time-frequency plane, produced by some of the fault related components, permits the machine diagnosis. Unlike other CWT based methods, this work uses complex frequency B-splines wavelets. It is shown that these wavelets enable high detail in the time-frequency maps and an efficient filtering in the region neighbouring the main frequency. These characteristics make easy the identification of the patterns related to the fault components. As an example, the technique has been applied to no load startup currents of healthy motors and motors with broken bars, showing the Complex FBS Wavelets capabilities. The diagnosis has been done via the identification of the upper sideband harmonic.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286912/5292748/05292777.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5292748","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5292777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Induction motor fault diagnosis based on analytic wavelet transform via Frequency B-Splines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Fault diagnosis","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Spline","Time frequency analysis","Power harmonic filters","Transient analysis","Electric machines","Continuous wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","induction motors","rotors","splines (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","fault diagnosis","analytic wavelet transform","frequency B-splines","transient motor current signature analysis","2D time frequency plot","upper sideband harmonic","broken rotor bars"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broken rotor bars","fault diagnosis","induction motor","signal analysis","transient analysis","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5292777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Induction motor fault diagnosis based on analytic wavelet transform via Frequency B-Splines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5292777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976516","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induction motor fault diagnosis based on analytic wavelet transform via Frequency B-Splines","confLoc":"Cargese, France","sourcePdf":"TF0049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076473S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286912","isNumber":"5292748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286912","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5292748","articleId":"5292777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5292781,"authors":[{"name":"Yury P.

The performance of the proposed method is compared with other methods as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and is validated through simulation with a mathematical model and experimental analysis of a 1.1 kW three-phase squirrel-cage commercial induction motor with eccentricity.","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292787","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286912/5292748/05292787.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5292748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis of eccentricity based on the Hilbert transform of the startup transient current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5292787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis of eccentricity based on the Hilbert transform of the startup transient current","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5292787/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976526","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis of eccentricity based on the Hilbert transform of the startup transient current","confLoc":"Cargese, France","sourcePdf":"TF0039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110913S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286912","isNumber":"5292748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286912","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5292748","articleId":"5292787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5292793,"authors":[{"name":"S.

They can exist in the form of static or dynamic eccentricity or both, in which case it is called a mixed eccentricity fault. These faults cause bearing damage, excessive vibration and noise, unbalanced magnetic pull (IMP) and under extreme conditions stator-rotor rub which may seriously damage the motors. Since eccentricity faults are often associated with large induction machines, the repair or replacement costs arising out of such a scenario may easily run into tens and thousands of dollars. Previous research have shown that it is extremely difficult to detect such faults if they appear individually, rather than in mixed form, unless the number of rotor bars and pole pair number conform to certain relationships. In this paper, it is shown that the terminal voltages of induction machines at switch-off reveal certain features that can lead to the detection of these faults in individual form, even in machines that do not show these signatures in line current spectrum in steady state.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Fault detection","Induction machines","Rotors","Induction motors","Magnetic noise","Magnetic levitation","Stators","Costs","Bars"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","frequency-domain analysis","induction motors","machine bearings","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pole pair","rotor slot number","frequency domain-based detection","mixed eccentricity fault","induction machines","semi online technique","induction motors","static eccentricity","dynamic eccentricity","bearing damage","unbalanced magnetic pull","rotor bars","line current spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eccentricity faults","induction motor","parameter independence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5292793","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292793","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286912/5292748/05292793.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5292748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5292793/","displayDocTitle":"Pole pair and rotor slot number independent frequency domain based detection of eccentricity faults in induction machines using a semi on-line technique","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 20096-Sept. 3 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10976532","htmlLink":"/document/5292793/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pole pair and rotor slot number independent frequency domain based detection of eccentricity faults in induction machines using a semi on-line technique","confLoc":"Cargese, France","sourcePdf":"TF0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055707S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 20096-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286912","isNumber":"5292748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286912","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5292748","articleId":"5292793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5292794,"authors":[{"name":"Abd Kadir Mahamad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Abd Kadir Mahamad (Student Member) received his B.E and M.E.in Electrical Engineering from University of Tun Hussein Onn, Malaysia.

The vibration signal used in this work is obtained from Case Western Reserve University website. During preprocessing stage, vibration signals are been converted from time domain into frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Then, enveloping method is used to eliminate the high frequency components from vibration signal. Subsequently, a set of 16 features from vibration and preprocessed signal are extracted. In order to reduce the size of data, a distance evaluation technique is used as features selection. In the development of ANN fault diagnosis, both networks EN (without GA) and GAEN (utilized with GA) in which results are compared and conclusions are drawn.","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292794","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286912/5292748/05292794.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2009.5292794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5292748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Elman Network using genetic algorithm for bearing failure diagnosis of induction motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Induction motors","Feature extraction","Testing","Frequency domain analysis","Band pass filters","Rectifiers","Low pass filters","Resonance","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machine analysis computing","fast Fourier transforms","fault diagnosis","genetic algorithms","induction motors","machine bearings","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Elman network","genetic algorithms","bearing failure diagnosis","induction motors","artificial neural network","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","ANN","EN","GA","1MB","distance evaluation technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5292794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 20096-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving Elman Network using genetic algorithm for bearing failure diagnosis of induction motor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5292794/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976533","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Elman Network using genetic algorithm for bearing failure diagnosis of induction motor","confLoc":"Cargese, France","sourcePdf":"TF0026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064766S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 20096-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286912","isNumber":"5292748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286912","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5292748","articleId":"5292794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5292804,"authors":[{"name":"Baptiste Trajin","affiliation":["INP, UPS; LAPLACE; ENSEEIHT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"p":["Baptiste Trajin was born in Rouen (France) on September 4, 1982.

The considered faults lead to amplitude and/or phase modulations of the measured stator current. The different faults can be characterized by their time-frequency signatures via the Wigner distribution. The time-frequency representations apply to complex signals that may be obtained through the Hubert transform of the real measured signal. In case of high frequency modulations, it can not be taken advantage of the time frequency signatures. This study proposes an alternative complex signal representation for modulated stator currents. The so-called space vector is obtained through the Concordia transform. From three stator current measurements, the Concordia transform builds a complex vector which conveniently carries the information about phase and amplitude modulations. This paper applies and compares the Wigner distribution computed with the Hilbert and Concordia transforms in case of simulated and experimental signals with various modulation frequency ranges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5292804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5292804/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976543","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wigner distribution for the diagnosis of high frequency amplitude and phase modulations on stator currents of induction machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wigner distribution for the diagnosis of high frequency amplitude and phase modulations on stator currents of induction machine","confLoc":"Cargese, France","sourcePdf":"TF0008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050987S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286912","isNumber":"5292748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286912","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5292748","articleId":"5292804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5293213,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A new algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal power allocation and optimal transmission rate allocation among multiple layers, subject to constraints on the total transmission rate and the total power level. This proposed joint power allocation and antenna selection algorithm in MIMO OFDM system enables us to both overcome the challenge of the full CSI that was assumed in the existing approaches and utilize the estimated CSI from the receiver so as to achieve the optimal solution for a video bitstream in terms of its total expected distortion.

The objective of this work is an analysis of state-of-the-art GaN microwave discrete transistors, MMICs and high power (10...100 Watt and more) amplifiers, parameters and basic tendencies in the development of GaN devices. Major properties of wideband gap semiconductors available for microwave transistors are presented in table 1. The highest energy gap, availability of high temperature and high radiation environment, an extremely high density of sheet carrier, higher electric fields and breakdown voltages result in 310 W/mm and more output power density of practical released microwave GaN transistors. Table 2 shows the main parameters of broadband (without internal matching circuits) GaN power transistors. The properties of WCDMA 120 W power transistors (Si LDMOS, GaAs MESFET and GaN HEMT) are compared in table 3. The typical density (for 1 mm gate) of various GaN and GaAs HEMT transistor parameters, including optimal load density, is presented in table 4. Many projects and MMIC topologies, designed for GaAs MMICs might be transferred with minimal corrections into the GaN MMICs based on equal or on (20...50) % wider gate of transistors with x(5-10) corresponding output power (see fig. 1). The main parameters of industrial and laboratorial GaN MMIC technologies are presented in table 5, table 6 shows parameters of commercially available and lab released GaN MMICs. Fig. 2 presents the last five years of an evolution of the pulse output power of X-band GaN MMIC amplifiers for future radar systems with phased array. The parameters of the ultra-wideband GaN high power amplifiers up to 6 GHz are presented in table 7, figure 3 shows the chip sizes of the highest power of X-band GaN and GaAs MMIC amplifiers. In the decade ahead (1...50) GHz frequency range will be a topic of arguing between two power microwave technologies. One of them is a high performance and a high cost of GaN technology, the second-low cost and widely used in the industry of GaAs technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Solid state circuits","Microwave amplifiers","Power amplifiers","MMICs","Gallium arsenide","Microwave transistors","High power amplifiers","Microwave devices","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","microwave power transistors","MMIC power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid-state microwave power amplifiers","MMIC","high power amplifiers","microwave discrete transistors","wideband gap semiconductors","WCDMA power transistors","GaN","GaAs"]}],"publicationTitle":"2009 19th International Crimean Conference Microwave & Telecommunication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 19th International Crimean Conference Microwave & Telecommunication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5287480/5292809/05293252.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5292809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gan solid-state microwave power amplifiers \u2014 State-of-the-art and future trends","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5293252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gan solid-state microwave power amplifiers \u2014 State-of-the-art and future trends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5293252/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5293252/","accessionNumber":"10941290","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gan solid-state microwave power amplifiers \u2014 State-of-the-art and future trends","confLoc":"Sevastopol, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"011016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042014S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5287480","isNumber":"5292809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5287480","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5292809","articleId":"5293252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CrSTC","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5293283,"authors":[{"name":"Fangfang Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of IPIU of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fangfang","lastName":"Wu","id":"38102873200"},{"name":"Guangming Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of IPIU of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Shi","id":"37267099300"},{"name":"Weisheng Dong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of IPIU of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37396032700"},{"name":"Xiaolin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281235500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4463-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4464-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5293283","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Image coding","Rate-distortion","Image reconstruction","Streaming media","Power system modeling","Signal processing","Application software","Computer science education","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning-based recovery","compressive sensing","multiple description coding","line granularity","multimedia signal","local adaptive bases","PSNR","visual quality"]}],"abstract":"The recently proposed compressive sensing (CS) theory provides a new solution for multiple description coding (MDC) with fine granularity, by treating each random CS measurement as a description. The performance of CS-based MDC (CS-MDC) depends on the efficacy of the CS recovery algorithm. Existing CS recovery algorithms recover the signal in a fixed space (e.g., Wavelet, DCT, and gradient spaces) for the entire duration of the signal, even though a typical multimedia signal exhibits sparsity in time/space variant spaces. To rectify this problem and develop a better CS recovery algorithm for CSMDC, we propose a learning-based framework to conduct the CS recovery in locally adaptive spaces, and carry out a case study on image MDC. A set of prior image models are learned offline from a training set to facilitate the CS recovery in local adaptive bases. Experiments show that the learning-based CS recovery algorithm can significantly improve the performance of the previous CS-MDC technique in both PSNR and visual quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-based recovery of compressive sensing with application in multiple description coding","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293283","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286205/5293242/05293283.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5293242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5293283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5293283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning-based recovery of compressive sensing with application in multiple description coding","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5293283/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10941619","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-based recovery of compressive sensing with application in multiple description coding","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110543S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286205","isNumber":"5293242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286205","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5293242","articleId":"5293283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5293309,"authors":[{"name":"Cha Zhang","affiliation":["Communication and Collaboration Group, Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Cha Zhang","id":"37288988200"},{"name":"Zhaozheng Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhaozheng Yin","id":"37895392200"},{"name":"Dinei Florencio","affiliation":["Communication and Collaboration Group, Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dinei","lastName":"Florencio","id":"37284939900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4463-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4464-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5293309","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Teleconferencing","Three dimensional displays","Cameras","Two dimensional displays","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image segmentation","Application software","Robustness","Glass","Animation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image motion analysis","teleconferencing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth perception","motion parallax","teleconferencing","3D perception","stereopsis","face tracking","foreground/background segmentation","face tracking algorithm","time-of-flight camera"]}],"abstract":"Depth perception, or 3D perception, can add a lot to the feeling of immersiveness in many applications such as 3D TV, 3D teleconferencing, etc. Stereopsis and motion parallax are two of the most important cues for depth perception.

In this paper, we propose to improve user's depth perception by tracking their motions and creating motion parallax for the rendered image, which can be done even with legacy displays. Two enabling technologies, face tracking and foreground/background segmentation, are discussed in detail. In particular, we propose an efficient and robust feature based face tracking algorithm that is capable of estimating the face's location and scale accurately.

In our proposed method, the encoder consists of a base layer and an enhancement layer. The base layer is a conventionally encoded bitstream and transmitted without any error protection. The additional enhancement layer is a stream of compressed measurements taken across slices of video signals for error-resilience. The decoder regards the corrupted base layer as the side information (SI) and employs a sparse recovery with SI to recover approximation of lost packets. By exploiting the SI at the decoder, the enhancement layer is required to transmit a minimal amount of compressed measurements for error protection that is only proportional to the amount of lost packets. Simulation results show that both compression efficiency and error-resilience capacity of the proposed scheme are competitive with those of other state-of-the-art robust transmission methods, in which Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coders often generate an enhancement layer. Thanks to the soft-decoding feature of sparse recovery algorithms, our CS-based scheme can avoid the cliff effect that often occurs with other Wyner-Ziv based schemes when the error rate is over the error correction capacity of the channel code. In addition, our result suggests that compressed sensing is actually closer to source coding with decoder side information than to conventional source coding.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293312","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286205/5293242/05293312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5293242","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust video transmission using Layered Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5293312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust video transmission using Layered Compressed Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5293312/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10941646","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5293312/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust video transmission using Layered Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060964S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286205","isNumber":"5293242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286205","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5293242","articleId":"5293312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5293446,"authors":[{"name":"Atul Divekar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Atul","lastName":"Divekar","id":"37393880900"},{"name":"Okan Ersoy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Okan","lastName":"Ersoy","id":"37275105700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4562-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4563-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-024X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0258"}],"articleNumber":"5293446","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":667},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Image coding","Image resolution","Dictionaries","Principal component analysis","Sparse matrices","Probability","Gaussian processes","Statistics","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image fusion","image representation","image resolution","principal component analysis","probability","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","compressive sensing","Gaussian-like vector","probability","statistical analysis","image resolution","panchromatic image","principal component analysis","statistical property","image representation","multispectral band image"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new method of image fusion that utilizes the recently developed theory of compressive sensing. Compressive sensing indicates that a signal that is sparse in an appropriate set of basis vectors may be recovered almost exactly from a few samples via l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization if the system matrix satisfies some conditions. These conditions are satisfied with high probability for Gaussian-like vectors. Since zero-mean image patches satisfy Gaussian statistics, they are suitable for compressive sensing. We create a dictionary that relates high resolution image patches from a panchromatic image to the corresponding filtered low resolution versions. We first propose two algorithms that directly use this dictionary and its low resolution version to construct the fused image. To reduce the computational cost of l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization, we use principal component analysis to identify the orthogonal \"modes\" of co-occurrence of the low and high resolution patches. Any pair of co-occurring high and low resolution patches with similar statistical properties to the patches in the dictionary is sparse with respect to the principal component bases. Given a patch from a low resolution multispectral band image, we use l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization to find the sparse representation of the low resolution patch with respect to the sample-domain principal components. Compressive sensing suggests that this is the same sparse representation that a high resolution image would have with respect to the principal components. Hence the sparse representation is used to combine the high resolution principal components to produce the high resolution fused image. This method adds high-resolution detail to a low-resolution multispectral band image keeping the same relationship that exists between the high and low resolution versions of the panchromatic image. This reduces the spectral distortion of the fused images and produces results superior to standard fusion methods such as the Brovey transform and principal component analysis.","doi":"10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2009.5293446","publicationTitle":"2009 17th International Conference on Geoinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th International Conference on Geoinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286203/5292806/05293446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2009.5293446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5292806","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image fusion by compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5293446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image fusion by compressive sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5293446/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930679","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5293446/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image fusion by compressive sensing","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"geoinformatics2009submission302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052196S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286203","isNumber":"5292806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286203","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5292806","articleId":"5293446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5293543,"authors":[{"name":"Mu Bai","affiliation":["School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mu Bai","id":"37088004816"},{"name":"Huiping Liu","affiliation":["School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huiping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37675892200"},{"name":"Wenli Huang","affiliation":["School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenli Huang","id":"37088002113"},{"name":"Yu Qiao","affiliation":["School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yu Qiao","id":"37087184664"},{"name":"Xiaodong Mu","affiliation":["School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Mu","id":"37087146659"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4562-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4563-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-024X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0258"}],"articleNumber":"5293543","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Satellites","Remote sensing","Artificial neural networks","Remote monitoring","Radiometry","Principal component analysis","Chaos","Geography","Computerized monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geographic information systems","neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic farmland extraction","multi-temporal landsat","artificial neural network","land utilization information","remote sensing image","land cover map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANN","Multi-temporal","Automatic Extraction","Farmland"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5293543","abstract":"It is an important method of the land use change dynamic monitoring to withdraw the land utilization information using remote sensing image accurately and quickly.

Because a BCI does not depend on the brain's normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles, it can provide a new communication channel to people with severe motor disabilities. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded from the surface of the scalp are widely used in current BCIs for their non-invasive nature and easy applications. Among EEG based BCIs, systems based on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) have received widespread attention in recent decades. We described the three stimulus modulation approaches used in current VEP based BCIs: time modulation (t-VEP), frequency modulation (f-VEP), and pseudorandom code modulation (c-VEP). We then carried out a detailed comparison of system performance between an f-VEP BCI and a c-VEP BCI. The results show that an f-VEP BCI has the advantage of little or no training and simple system configuration, while the c-VEP based BCI has a higher communication speed. The stimulus modulation design is the crux of VEP based BCI systems.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2009.934562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5294921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2009.934562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/5294921/05294934.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VEP-based brain-computer interfaces: time, frequency, and code modulations [Research Frontier]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"VEP-based brain-computer interfaces: time, frequency, and code modulations [Research Frontier]","volume":"4","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5294934/","publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10951072","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5294934/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VEP-based brain-computer interfaces: time, frequency, and code modulations [Research Frontier]","sourcePdf":"22-26-04mci04-research.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081633S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"5294921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"5294921","articleId":"5294934","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5294937,"authors":[{"name":"Damien Coyle","affiliation":["University of Ulster, UK"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Coyle","id":"37317373400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"5294937","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1222},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Brain computer interfaces","Electroencephalography","Electrodes","Linear discriminant analysis","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Biomedical signal processing","Signal mapping","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","medical signal processing","neural nets","pattern classification","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","auto association","biosignal processing","brain-computer interfaces","neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing","NTSPP","electroencephalogram","common spatial patterns","multichannel BCI","statistical classifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5294937","abstract":"Neural networks (NNs) can be deployed in many different ways in signal processing applications. This paper illustrates how neural networks are employed in a prediction based preprocessing framework, referred to as neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP), in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). NTSPP has been shown to increase feature separability by mapping the original EEG signals via time-series-prediction to a higher dimensional space. Preliminary results of a similar novel framework are also presented where, instead of using predictive NNs, auto-associative NNs are employed and features are extracted from the output of auto-associative NNs trained to specialize on EEG signals for particular brain states. The results show that this preprocessing framework referred to as auto-associative NN preprocessing (ANNP) also has the potential to improve the performance of BCIs. Both the NTSPP and ANNP are compared with and deployed in conjunction with the well know common spatial patterns (CSP) to produce a BCI system which significantly outperforms either approach operating independently and has the potential to produce good performances even with a lower number of EEG channels compared to a multichannel BCI. Multichannel BCIs normally perform better that 2-3 channel BCIs however reducing the number of EEG channels required can positively impact on the time needed to mount electrodes and minimize the obtrusiveness of the electrode montage for the user. It is also shown that NTSPP can improve the potential for employing existing BCI methods with minimal subject-specific parameter tuning to deploy the BCI autonomously. Results are presented with six different classification approaches including various statistical classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a Bayes classifier.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2009.934560","startPage":"47","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2009.934560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5294921","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/5294921/05294937.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based auto association and time-series prediction for biosignal processing in brain-computer interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5294937/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network based auto association and time-series prediction for biosignal processing in brain-computer interfaces","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5294937/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10943019","publicationDate":"November 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based auto association and time-series prediction for biosignal processing in brain-computer interfaces","sourcePdf":"47-59-04mci04-coyle.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135742S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"5294921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5294921","articleId":"5294937","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5295819,"authors":[{"name":"Bie Zhisong","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bie","lastName":"Zhisong","id":"38109615400"},{"name":"Zhang Rui","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Rui","id":"38102116900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5302-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5301-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5295819","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","State feedback","Delay","Frequency domain analysis","Scheduling","Bandwidth","Downlink","Compressed sensing","Wideband","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparsity-based channel state information acquisition","feedback scheme","MIMO-OFDMA systems","multiple-in multiple-out orthogonal frequency multiple access","downlink channel state information","channel impulse response","channel quality indicator","third generation partner project long term evolution","3GPP LTE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channle state information(CSI)","delay-domain sparsity","Compressed sensing","feedback overhead"]}],"abstract":"In MIMO-OFDMA (multiple-in multiple-out orthogonal frequency multiple access) based systems, the downlink channel state information (CSI) acquired at the basestation is an important factor to impact the system capacity, since both scheduling and precoding cannot work efficiently without accurate and enough CSI.

In this paper, a CSI acquisition and feedback scheme based on the delay-domain sparsity of channel impulse response is proposed.

Next a simplified spatial correlation model of outdoor BS is introduced in closed-form expression. This approach has negligible difference compared to the reference correlation values.

rough set comprehensive performance evaluation approach for routing protocols in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Performance evaluation for routing protocols is still an unexplored field in cognitive radio networks (CRNET) and faces great challenges. In this paper, we propose a rough set approach to comprehensive performance evaluation of routing protocols in CRNET. We further present a multi-layer evaluation index system based on an analytic hierarchy process for CRNET routing protocols. In the proposed approach, rough set theory is applied to explore the evaluation index data of routing protocols. In addition, the concept of information entropy is introduced to determine the weighting coefficients of evaluation indexes and the subjectivity that influences the determination of weighting coefficients is effectively reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5295841/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10942980","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5295841/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A rough set comprehensive performance evaluation approach for routing protocols in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rough set comprehensive performance evaluation approach for routing protocols in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"P47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066777S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289329","isNumber":"5295815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289329","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5295815","articleId":"5295841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5295843,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-Wei Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China","Nation Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Ningbo, Ningbo, China","College of Information Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zi-Wei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37280345100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5302-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5301-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5295843","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Phase noise","OFDM","Fading","Digital TV","Multimedia communication","TV broadcasting","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia systems","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital video broadcasting","fading channels","multimedia communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","phase noise","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation scheme","TDS-OFDM-based DTTB system","time domain synchronous","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique","digital television terrestrial broadcasting system","bandwidth-efficient multimedia service","multipath fading technique","wireless channel","high-bit-rate transmission","phase noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","terrestrial digital television broadcasting","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"As an effective technique for combating multipath fading and for high-bit-rate transmission over wireless channels, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is extensively used in modern digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB) systems to support high performance bandwidth-efficient multimedia services.

Simulation results show better BER performance compared to conventional modulation schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289329/5295815/05295867.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 Global Mobile Congress","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2009.5295867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2009.5295867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5295867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM-ROF system with combined adaptive modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","OFDM modulation","Fading","Optical fiber communication","Nonlinear distortion","Degradation","Bit error rate","Optical transmitters","Wireless communication","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","optical links","optical modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-ROF system","combined adaptive modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","radio over fiber technique","wireless network","optical link","multipath fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Radio over fiber","adaptive modulation","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5295867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM-ROF system with combined adaptive modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5295867/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951018","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of OFDM-ROF system with combined adaptive modulation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"P81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042918S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289329","isNumber":"5295815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289329","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5295815","articleId":"5295867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5295872,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Estimation range of fractional frequency offset (FFO) is derived based on the preamble structure. A novel algorithm with double sliding windows detection (DSWD) is proposed for integer frequency offset (IFO) estimation. The main idea behind this algorithm is to find the boundary of the data carriers and virtual carrers (VC) and calculate the energy ratio of the two consecutive sliding windows. Due to this feature, DSWD algorithm has the immunity to the ambiguity of symbol timing offset. Simulation results are assessed in terms of estimated frequency offset, probability of false alarm and bit-error-rate (BER) performance, which illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm in the OFDM receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289329/5295815/05295872.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 Global Mobile Congress","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2009.5295872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2009.5295872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5295872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency offset estimation with ambiguity of symbol timing offset for IEEE 802.16D OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Timing","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Wireless LAN","Maximum likelihood estimation","Baseband","Digital video broadcasting","Digital filters","Phase estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency estimation","IEEE standards","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional frequency offset estimation","symbol timing offset","IEEE 802.16d standard","OFDM system","frequency synchronization scheme","double sliding windows detection","integer frequency offset estimation","bit-error-rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5295872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Frequency offset estimation with ambiguity of symbol timing offset for IEEE 802.16D OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5295872/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10942963","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency offset estimation with ambiguity of symbol timing offset for IEEE 802.16D OFDM system","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"P33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044139S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289329","isNumber":"5295815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289329","xplore-issue":"5295815","articleId":"5295872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5295878,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Lianghui","affiliation":["Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Lianghui","id":"37706206500"},{"name":"Hu Hanying","affiliation":["Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Hanying","id":"37297467900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5302-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5301-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5295878","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Particle filters","Bayesian methods","Inference algorithms","Parameter estimation","Colored noise","Probability density function","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","code division multiple access","multiuser detection","Poisson distribution","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint active user identification","timing estimation","multiuser detection","asynchronous DS-CDMA system","Bayesian solution","observation vector","Poisson process","colored noise","Poisson distribution","conditional distribution","conditional posterior probability density function","subspace algorithm","Bayesian inference","RJMCMC algorithm","particle filter","parameters estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel Bayesian solution to the difficult problem of joint active users' identification, timing estimation and multiuser detection in an asynchronous DS-CDMA system.

We also derive the optimal transmitter power allocation strategy that achieve this capacity gain under perfect CSI feedback.

As a result, the amplifier delivers 18 dBm of maximum RF output power and 14.5 dBm output power at 1 dB compression. The circuit shows 7.8% of power added efficiency (PAE) from a 1.8 V supply voltage at 65 GHz. The power amplifier was fully integrated including matching elements and bias circuit. The matching networks use coplanar waveguide (CPW) lines and MIM capacitors for high integration purpose.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5295904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5295904/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957282","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"59\u201371GHz wideband MMIC balanced power amplifier in a 0.13um SiGe technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"59\u201371GHz wideband MMIC balanced power amplifier in a 0.13um SiGe technology","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073577S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286914","isNumber":"5295902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286914","xplore-issue":"5295902","articleId":"5295904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5295919,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Ghajar","affiliation":["Emerging Radio System Group, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Ghajar","id":"38113907600"},{"name":"Slim Boumaiza","affiliation":["Emerging Radio System Group, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Boumaiza","id":"37283433900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4749-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5295919","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Dual band","Power amplifiers","Radio frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Circuits","Signal processing","Switches","Microwave amplifiers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","MMIC power amplifiers","software radio","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual band fully integrated power amplifier","CMOS technology","dual-band matching network","multistandard radiofrequency frontend","power added efficiency","software defined radio","frequency 2.4 GHz","frequency 3.5 GHz","size 0.13 mum","size 1.25 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated","Power Amplifier","Dual band front ends"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5295919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295902","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286914/5295902/05295919.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent dual band 2.4/3.5GHz fully integrated power amplifier in 0.13\u00b5m CMOS technology","abstract":"This paper proposes novel dual-band matching network, suitable for the design of integrated concurrent dual band power amplifier in a multi-standard radiofrequency frontend.

From the proposed design concept, a PA is implemented using 45-W GaN HEMT device at 2.655 GHz. The designed PA has a maximum drain efficiency of 71.5% at a saturated output power of 46.8 dBm for CW signal.

Regarding the performance, the designed single stage PA has exhibited 9 \u00b1 1 dB gain, an output power (Pout) of greater than 37 dBm (5 W), worst power added efficiency (PAE) of 20% over a multi-octave (0.35-8 GHz) bandwidth. The PA has been also fully characterized from the linearity point of view based on single-tone (AM/AM, AM/PM) and two-tone techniques (with 100 kHz frequency spacing). An AM/AM and AM/PM distortions of only \u00b1 0.5 [dB/dB] and \u00b1 2 [dB/deg] at 8 GHz have been observed. As a measure of linearity in two-tone performance an output third-and second- order intercept points (OIP3, OIP2) have been extracted over the whole bandwidth. An OIP3 of \u2265 49 dBm and OIP2 of \u2265 67 dBm can be achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Bandwidth","Linearity","Performance evaluation","Coaxial components","Bonding","Wires","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear power amplifier","GaN HEMT","load pull characterization","3D-EM simulation","bandwidth 0.35 GHz to 8 GHz","frequency 100 kHz","frequency 8 GHz","power 5 W","GaN"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2009.5295942","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286913/5295900/05295942.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2009.5295942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5W, 0.35\u20138 GHz linear power amplifier using GaN HEMT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5295942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"5W, 0.35\u20138 GHz linear power amplifier using GaN HEMT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5295942/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5295942/","accessionNumber":"10957001","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5W, 0.35\u20138 GHz linear power amplifier using GaN HEMT","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047309S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5295942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5295961,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It is shown that thin layers of LCP can be successfully used in a wafer level packaging scheme for hybrid integration of SiGe RF electronics and organic packaging layers.","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2009.5295965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2009.5295965","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286913/5295900/05295965.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Organic wafer-scale packaging for X-band SiGe low noise amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Organic wafer-scale packaging for X-band SiGe low noise amplifier","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5295965/","accessionNumber":"10957058","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5295965/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Organic wafer-scale packaging for X-band SiGe low noise amplifier","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042693S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5295965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5295967,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Dan Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Dan Dong","id":"38109618200"},{"name":"Tatsuo Itoh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tatsuo","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37279606000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4748-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5295967","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1459},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leaky wave antennas","Etching","Surface waves","Antennas and propagation","Capacitors","Planar waveguides","Cutoff frequency","Antenna measurements","Integrated circuit technology","Waveguide components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","leaky wave antennas","waveguide antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite right/left-handed substrate integrated waveguide","leaky-wave antennas","series interdigital capacitors","balanced CRLH waveguide leaky-wave antenna","continuous beam-steering capability","frequency-scanned leaky-wave antenna","double-side radiation","quasiomnidirectional feature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Composite right/left-handed (CRLH)","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","leaky-wave antennas"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite right/left-handed substrate integrated waveguide leaky-wave antennas","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2009.5295967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295900","endPage":"279","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286913/5295900/05295967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2009.5295967","startPage":"276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5295967","abstract":"Leaky-wave antennas based on composite right/left-handed (CRLH) substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) are investigated and presented in this paper. By introducing series interdigital capacitors, which are realized by etching slots on the waveguide surface, a balanced CRLH waveguide leaky-wave antenna with a continuous beam-steering capability has been implemented. The backfire radiation is obtained when the waveguide is operated below its characteristic cutoff frequency while the broadside radiation is achieved at the balancing frequency point. By embedding the series interdigital capacitors in both the top surface and the ground of the SIW, a frequency-scanned leaky-wave antenna characterized by double-side radiation or a quasi-omnidirectional feature is achieved. The measured results show that the proposed antennas offer a scanning angle covering almost backfire-to-endfire directions with relatively high gains.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5295967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10957059","htmlLink":"/document/5295967/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Composite right/left-handed substrate integrated waveguide leaky-wave antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite right/left-handed substrate integrated waveguide leaky-wave antennas","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036864S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5295967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5295977,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The proposed method fully characterizes the nearfield and the farfield of the antenna, so to compute farfield patterns by means of superposition for any voltage/current state at the port terminals. A recently published low-cost patch antenna phased array with analog beam steering by another group was found very suitable to demonstrate the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5296009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5296009/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957090","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Class-F Power Amplifiers for Handset Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Class-F Power Amplifiers for Handset Applications","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047345S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5296009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5296024,"authors":[{"name":"Vittorio Rizzoli","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Rizzoli","id":"37275106700"},{"name":"Giacomo Bichicchi","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Bichicchi","id":"38111388700"},{"name":"Alessandra Costanzo","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Costanzo","id":"37275108300"},{"name":"Francesco Donzelli","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Donzelli","id":"37545347600"},{"name":"Diego Masotti","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Masotti","id":"37268749600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4749-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5296024","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5296024","abstract":"We introduce a compact, lightweight and highly efficient multi-resonator rectenna (rectifying antenna) designed to harvest the RF energy really obtainable in humanized environments. Such sources, radiated from cell phones, radio transmitters and Wi-Fi equipments, are ubiquitously available but have very low power densities, at different frequency bands, with unknown directions of incidence and polarization. In order to harvest a significant quantity of energy it is mandatory to put a very special care in the design of each part of the receiving/storing system. For this purpose a combination of resonant antennas, each one designed for a specific application-dependent frequency band, is optimised together with the rectifying circuit and the load. This is accomplished by a rigorous design tool, based on the concurrent use of nonlinear and electromagnetic CAD methods. Multi-source non linear simulation of the harvester in realistic operating conditions predicts a DC power of a few hundred muW, which represents the typical energy requirement of a sensor node.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295902","startPage":"331","endPage":"334","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286914/5295902/05296024.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAD of multi-resonator rectenna for micro-power generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectennas","Design automation","Radio frequency","Cellular phones","Radio transmitters","Optical polarization","Resonance","Loaded antennas","Design optimization","Rectifying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","computational electromagnetics","energy harvesting","low-power electronics","rectennas","rectifying circuits","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresonator rectenna","micropower generation","CAD","RF energy harvesting","cell phone","radio transmitter","Wi-Fi equipment","unknown incidence direction","unknown polarization direction","nonlinear-electromagnetic CAD method","multisource nonlinear harvester simulation","DC power","rectifying antenna","humanized environment","resonant antenna","specific application-dependent frequency band","rectifying circuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"CAD of multi-resonator rectenna for micro-power generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5296024/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5296024/","accessionNumber":"10957236","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAD of multi-resonator rectenna for micro-power generation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03822S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286914","isNumber":"5295902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286914","xplore-issue":"5295902","articleId":"5296024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5296034,"authors":[{"name":"Chau-Ching Chiong","affiliation":["Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chau-Ching","lastName":"Chiong","id":"37317473000"},{"name":"Wei-Je Tzeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Je","lastName":"Tzeng","id":"38110129500"},{"name":"Yuh-Jing Hwang","affiliation":["Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuh-Jing","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37275286200"},{"name":"Wei-Ting Wong","affiliation":["Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Ting","lastName":"Wong","id":"37085737357"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092300"},{"name":"Ming-Tang Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Tang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407030600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4749-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5296034","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Extraterrestrial measurements","Noise measurement","Cryogenics","mHEMTs","Low-noise amplifiers","Receivers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Gain","Temperature","Energy consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5296034","abstract":"Design and cryogenic operation of an intermediate frequency (IF) low noise amplifier using a 0.15-\u00b5m InGaAs mHEMT process for Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is presented in this paper.

Based on the co-design approach, the printed meander-line antenna and a quarter-wavelength resonator are used and integrated to be the filtering antenna. Here, an antenna performs not only a radiator but also the last resonator of the bandpass filter. A new structure of the quarter-wavelength resonator is also proposed, which can provide a shunt resonator with high capacitance and introduce two extra transmission zeros for selectivity enhancement. According to the filter specifications, a design procedure is depicted in detail. One example of a 2.45 GHz two-pole filtering antenna is described based on the second-order Chebyshev bandpass filter with 0.1 dB equal-ripple response. Furthermore, the proposed structure supply good filter skirt selectivity. The measured results, including the return loss and antenna gain versus frequency, have good agreement with the designed one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New printed filtering antenna with selectivity enhancement","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2009.5296120","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286913/5295900/05296120.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2009.5296120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295900","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5296120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5296120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"New printed filtering antenna with selectivity enhancement","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5296120/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10956833","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New printed filtering antenna with selectivity enhancement","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119531S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5296120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5296131,"authors":[{"name":"Per Landin","affiliation":["Center of RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Landin","id":"37697726000"},{"name":"Olof Bengtsson","affiliation":["Ferdinand-Braun-Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chfrequenztechnik, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Olof","lastName":"Bengtsson","id":"37325866600"},{"name":"Magnus Isaksson","affiliation":["Center of RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Isaksson","id":"37300472700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4748-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5296131","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Predistortion","Power system modeling","Reflection","Filters","Baseband","Signal generators","Microwave amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","measurement systems","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier","behavioural model mismatch sensitivity","digital predistortion performance","in-band reflections","measurement system","model extraction process","load-pull system","digital baseband model extraction system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5296131","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2009.5296131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2009.5296131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295900","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286913/5295900/05296131.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power amplifier behavioural model mismatch sensitivity and the impact on digital predistortion performance","abstract":"This paper presents an investigation of power amplifier behavioural model performance sensitivity to in-band reflections. The measurement system and model extraction process is presented together with the results and an analysis of the effect of parameter variations in a digitally predistorted system. A load-pull system is used together with a digital baseband model extraction system to identify the impact on modelling performance. The results show that the model performance varies greatly with in-band reflection magnitude and phase on the amplifier output. It is also shown that a digital predistortion based on a model extracted at matched conditions, where it gives an excellent improvement of 20 dB in adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR), gives a poor improvement of 7 dB for miss-matched conditions with as low reflections as \u0393 = 0.2 (return loss 14 dB). This indicates that in-band reflections need to be considered and adaptive predistortion used also for low VSWR system like base-stations for telecommunication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5296131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5296131/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957140","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power amplifier behavioural model mismatch sensitivity and the impact on digital predistortion performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power amplifier behavioural model mismatch sensitivity and the impact on digital predistortion performance","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039412S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5296131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5296136,"authors":[{"name":"H.

From the experiments, the proposed class-E PA achieves maximum power added efficiency (PAE) of 70.2% at the output power of 43.05 dBm with the saturation gain of 12.7 dB. Harmonics are well below -46 dBc for 2nd harmonic and -52 dBc for 3rd, 4th, and 5th harmonics through the 8 dB output dynamic range. Comparing the complexity and the size, the proposed DGS load-network is much simpler and smaller than the conventional load-network with a number of open stubs, ensuring comparable harmonic load impedance and amplifier performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5296209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5296209/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957197","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A compact DGS load-network for highly efficient class-E power amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact DGS load-network for highly efficient class-E power amplifier","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046455S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5296209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5296212,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This new model tackles the inaccuracy of conventional Hammerstein scheme in accounting for the short term memory effects of the RFPA by adding an extra branch. For that, an error signal between the output and the input signal of the memoryless submodel is first computed and processed by an additional filter. The filtered error signal is then post-injected at the output of the model. This extra modeling mechanism leads to remarkable accuracy when modeling two different RFPAs operating at different biasing points and driven with 4 carrier (4C) WCDMA signals.

In this framework, the main challenges are the detection of targets located on the other side of a wall and the monitoring of their motion. To pursue these aims, we propose an imaging strategy based on the linear sampling method (LSM), a computationally effective tool to determine the targets' morphology from multiview, multistatic and monochromatic data. In particular, by relying on the physical interpretation of LSM, we give its formulation for TWI and propose its use for motion tracking purposes by means of a simple post-processing strategy. A numerical example is given to assess the performances of the approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Microwave imaging","Optical imaging","Monitoring","Electromagnetic scattering","Optical scattering","Inverse problems","Microwave theory and techniques","Antenna measurements","Position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","microwave imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear sampling method","time-lapse qualitative through-the-wall imaging","target detection","multiview data","multistatic data","monochromatic data","motion tracking"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2009.5296263","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286913/5295900/05296263.pdf","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5295900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2009.5296263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear sampling method for time-lapse qualitative through-the-wall imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5296263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear sampling method for time-lapse qualitative through-the-wall imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5296263/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5296263/","accessionNumber":"10982025","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear sampling method for time-lapse qualitative through-the-wall imaging","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060846S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286913","isNumber":"5295900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286913","xplore-issue":"5295900","articleId":"5296263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5296288,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The former enhances compensation of nonlinearity and gains the optimal ratio of linearization degree to computational complexity by adjusting the number of injections. The latter minimizes memory effects of the power amplifier (PA) using digital signal processing. The proposed linearizer is integrated into the baseband block, and does not require additional radio-frequency components. For demonstration, a wideband 25-dB gain power amplifier is linearized using the proposed predistortion.

The FEM is composed of a single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) IC, a PAM, two Tx LPFs, two matching circuits for 802.11 b/g (low band) and 802.11 a (high band), two Rx BPFs, Tx diplexer for low/high band, and Rx diplexer for low/high band. Tx diplexer, Rx diplexer, two LPFs, two BPFs, and two matching circuits are fully integrated in the low temperature co-fire ceramic (LTCC) substrate. The optimal impedance of the matching circuit is obtained by using load pull equipment. The matching circuit and the Tx LPF for high band employ the geometry of strip line by using parasitic capacitance and inductance in the high frequency instead of avoiding these effects. Two diplexers apply conjugate matching method. The size of implemented module is given as 7.0 mm \u00d7 6.0 mm \u00d7 1.2 mm. The implemented module was measured as two parts. One is Rx part which includes the SPDT switch, Rx diplexer and two BPFs, the other is Tx Part which includes the SPDT switch, the Tx diplexer and two LPFs. In case of Rx, the insertion loss is less than 3.3 dB and the return loss is more than 15.5 dB in low/high pass band. In case of Tx, the insertion loss is less than 2.6 dB and the return loss is more than 11.3 dB. The measured adjacent-channel ratios (ACPRs) at first and second side-lobe in low band are -30.2 dBc and -50.0 dBc, respectively.

The initiation of a trip and the clearing time (opening) of any upstream device is a critical component in the reduction of the resultant arc flash incident energy. Combining technologies that detect and interrogate both arc flash and the associated arc current signatures in combination with arc resistant switchgear or controlgear, can provide a coordinated solution for controlling the level of incident energy at various points within the distribution network. Hybrid systems of this type provide the highest level of personnel protection, along with comprehensive equipment protection, as detection and initiation of tripping is implemented faster than with conventional relaying techniques alone. The reduction of the overall trip time can reduce equipment collateral damage, reconditioning time and lost productivity resulting from downtime. These types of coordinated systems will also lower the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements based on incident energy. This paper compares several systems including conventional overcurrent protection, zone selective and various light and current sensing systems.","doi":"10.1109/PCICON.2009.5297148","publicationTitle":"2009 Record of Conference Papers - Industry Applications Society 56th Annual Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Record of Conference Papers - Industry Applications Society 56th Annual Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5287479/5297140/05297148.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCICON.2009.5297148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297140","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protection at the speed of light: Arc-flash protection combining arc flash sensing and arc-resistant technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Protection at the speed of light: Arc-flash protection combining arc flash sensing and arc-resistant technologies","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297148/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957515","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5297148/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protection at the speed of light: Arc-flash protection combining arc flash sensing and arc-resistant technologies","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PCIC200941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085071S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5287479","isNumber":"5297140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5287479","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5297140","articleId":"5297148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5297169,"authors":[{"name":"George Roscoe","affiliation":["GE Consumer and Industrial, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mr. George Roscoe is a member of GE's Innovation design team and has several patents in the field of arc-flash protection pending.

Though more thoughtfully applied than they may have been in the past, none of these methods has provided a solution for all situations, particularly in existing installations. This paper will describe a method and include test results of an arc-flash energy sequestration that is able to divert an arcing fault's energy into a specific environment within a half-cycle after initiation of the arc. This is achieved without the need to introduce bolted fault current like a crowbar or for fast current interruption, such as a current-limiting fuse. The system protection provided has the benefits of arc-resistant switchgear without reliance on equipment sheathing and can be added after normal equipment is installed. Further advantages include the protection system and switchgear's ability for reuse after an arcing event, as well as the ability to easily test without the need for cumbersome high-current test equipment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Record of Conference Papers - Industry Applications Society 56th Annual Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5287479/5297140/05297169.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2009 Record of Conference Papers - Industry Applications Society 56th Annual Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference","doi":"10.1109/PCICON.2009.5297169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCICON.2009.5297169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc-flash energy mitigation by fast energy capture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy capture","Fuses","Switchgear","Circuit faults","Circuit breakers","Hazards","Explosion protection","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","IEEE members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arcs (electric)","fault current limiters","flashover","switchgear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arc-flash energy mitigation","fast energy capture","arc-flash incident energy reduction","protective devices","arc-resistant enclosures","arc-flash energy encapsulation","arc-flash energy sequestration","arcing fault energy","bolted fault current","fast current interruption","current-limiting fuse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arc-flash","Arc-flash Protection","Arcing Fault Diversion","Crow Bar","Arc-Resistant Switchgear","Fast Arc-flash Protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Arc-flash energy mitigation by fast energy capture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5297169/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957548","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc-flash energy mitigation by fast energy capture","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PCIC200902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123897S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5287479","isNumber":"5297140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5287479","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5297140","articleId":"5297169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5297175,"authors":[{"name":"Ray Luna","affiliation":["GE Multilin, League, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ray Luna (M'08) received the B.S.

The whole direction of arrival angular region is divided into subsectors as in MN-MUST. Detection and filtering stages are replaced by subarray beam forming stage. Subarray beamforming stage filters out the signals outside the sector of interest. Beamforming is not the scope of this study however, the phase differences between virtual subarrays are used in DOA estimation stage.

The conventional modelization of the HIS based on the averaged expressions for FSS impedance reveals sufficiently accurate both for normal and oblique incidence for simple FSS shapes, such as patches, and for suitably thick dielectrics. Here a simple model able to predict the behavior of high impedance surfaces comprising arbitrary FSS shapes is presented. The present model assumes a preliminary analysis of the FSS in freestanding configuration for retrieving the equivalent L and C parameters of a certain FSS geometry. In the paper, the variations of the FSS inductance and capacitance are analyzed when a thin substrate is employed. In particular, it is interesting to observe how the FSS capacitance and inductance are modified for thin substrate where the conventional transmission line approach fails. This analysis allows to define a range of validity of the formulations available in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2009.5297348","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289118/5297261/05297348.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2009.5297348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An equivalent-circuit modeling of high impedance surfaces employing arbitrarily shaped FSS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297348/","displayDocTitle":"An equivalent-circuit modeling of high impedance surfaces employing arbitrarily shaped FSS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10974957","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5297348/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An equivalent-circuit modeling of high impedance surfaces employing arbitrarily shaped FSS","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062366S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289118","isNumber":"5297261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289118","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5297261","articleId":"5297348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5297365,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We will address two wireless communication scenarios, firstly between wireless nodes within a tunnel and secondly for a below to above ground situation where one of the wireless nodes is located in a below ground fire hydrant (FH) chamber. Frequency Diversity (FD) is one method that can be used to address the problem of link unreliability owing to multipath induced fading. However, no quantitative investigation on the potential performance gains from the use of FD in these scenarios has previously been presented.

The general method is to build an empirical PL model based on the experimental results. However, with this approach, extensive field measurements considering different scenarios have to be carried out. This is both time consuming and site specific. On the other hand, constructing a full 3D electromagnetic (EM) model can be both complex and computational infeasible for a large scale problem.

Due to the high diffraction losses at millimetre-wave frequencies and beyond, establishing radio links in shadowing situations will require beam forming in order to exploit scattering and reflection processes. For the development and standardisation of these systems, double directional spatial channel models for non-line-of-sight situations have to be derived. Double directional channel models contain information both about angle of arrival at the receiver and angle of departure at the transmitter. An attractive possibility currently pursued both in research projects and standardisation is to derive these channel models based on ray-tracing simulations. This paper presents results from indoor channel measurements and shows the potential of ray tracing for 60 GHz channel modelling.","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2009.5297379","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289118/5297261/05297379.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2009.5297379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of ray tracing to derive channel models for future multi-gigabit systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297379/","displayDocTitle":"Application of ray tracing to derive channel models for future multi-gigabit systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966893","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5297379/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of ray tracing to derive channel models for future multi-gigabit systems","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042644S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289118","isNumber":"5297261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289118","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5297261","articleId":"5297379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5297397,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A fundamental obstacle in self-servo track writing is radial error propagation due to written-in repeatable runout (RRO) in the seed track and external disturbances. In this paper, we introduce a control scheme for the self-servo track writing process using a state-space disturbance observer. A linear quadratic Gaussian/loop transfer recovery controller with a state-space disturbance observer is designed for feedback control. In addition, feedforward control for the reference correction signal is designed to prevent radial error propagation. From simulation results, it turns out that the nonrepeatable runout (NRRO) component is a major source of AC track squeeze. The proposed disturbance observer is very effective in reducing the effect of the NRRO. The proposed control scheme is validated by simulation results which show improvement in the standard deviation and the AC track squeeze of the written tracks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Design for Self-Servo Track Writing Using a State-Space Disturbance Observer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2029626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5297456/05297558.pdf","startPage":"5094","endPage":"5099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2029626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297456","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297558/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Control Design for Self-Servo Track Writing Using a State-Space Disturbance Observer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5297558/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10950252","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Design for Self-Servo Track Writing Using a State-Space Disturbance Observer","sourcePdf":"45tmag11-cchung-part1-2029626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037579S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5297456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5297456","articleId":"5297558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5297599,"authors":[{"name":"Richard D.

To achieve this potential we need new designs that build on what we have learned from existing maglev designs, while taking advantage of supporting technology that did not exist when most of them were created. The keys to reducing energy intensity are to use light vehicles with low aerodynamic drag, use a linear synchronous motor that is excited in short sections, and operate with a dynamic schedule that achieves a high load factor. The key to affordability is to use small, light vehicles that can operate on less expensive guideways, and require less power for propulsion. This paper provides more details on these issues, provides estimates of what is feasible with today's technology, and discusses how to choose performance parameters, such as speed and acceleration, so as to maximize the probability that maglev will become the technology of choice for a wide range of applications. It also includes an historical perspective and recommendations for future development.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic levitation","Acceleration","Synchronous motors","Transportation","Aerodynamics","Propulsion","Shape","Vehicle dynamics","Dynamic scheduling","Vehicle safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerodynamics","linear synchronous motors","magnetic levitation","propulsion","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affordable maglev opportunities","United States","transportation applications","light vehicles","aerodynamic drag","linear synchronous motor","propulsion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automated people mover","linear motor","linear synchronous motor","maglev"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2030251","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5297592/05297599.pdf","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2030251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Affordable Maglev Opportunities in the United States","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297599","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Affordable Maglev Opportunities in the United States","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297599/","volume":"97","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5297599/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10950210","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Affordable Maglev Opportunities in the United States","sourcePdf":"jproc-thornton-2030251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117444S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5297592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5297592","articleId":"5297599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5297624,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We have integrated our DWT into the Dirac wavelet video codec (DWVC), of which the overlapped block motion compensation and frame arithmetic have been accelerated using CUDA as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297658/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10942912","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5297658/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating wavelet-based video coding on graphics hardware using CUDA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating wavelet-based video coding on graphics hardware using CUDA","confLoc":"Salzburg, Austria","sourcePdf":"106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071988S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289328","isNumber":"5297612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289328","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5297612","articleId":"5297658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5297710,"authors":[{"name":"Andras Hajdu","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"Andras","lastName":"Hajdu","id":"37397618000"},{"name":"Peter Veres","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Veres","id":"37295992300"},{"name":"Attila Tanacs","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary"],"firstName":"Attila","lastName":"Tanacs","id":"37595089600"},{"name":"Roland Harangozo","affiliation":["Kripto Kft., Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Harangozo","id":"37397616900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-953-184-135-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-184-134-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1845-5921"}],"articleNumber":"5297710","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Informatics","Humans","Retina","Object detection","Performance gain","Solids","Image processing","Diabetes","Retinopathy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object subsampling","computational performance","object simplification","centroidal Voronoi tesselation","constrained CVT","custom weight functions","object properties","subsampling strategies","human detection","retinal vascular system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297710","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297612","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289328/5297612/05297710.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object subsampling strategies to improve computational performance","abstract":"We investigate object simplification methods based on Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation (CVT) that share the possibility of great speed-ups in various scenarios.

The scalable content should be as flexible as possible to achieve the credo of creating the content once and adapting it to fulfill given requirements. As far as flexibility goes wavelet based codecs are superior. A problem which arises is that the adaptation does not necessarily happen on a device which is aware of the codec which was used in content creation. To rectify this non-awareness, MPEG-21 introduced digital item adaptation in part 7 to abstract the bitstream of a given video. This allows in-network adaptation on nodes which are DIA aware to adapt any video stream as long as a DIA description is given. The drawback is that the DIA description must be sent parallel to the original video sequence. In this paper we will look at how a DIA description for a t+2D scalable wavelet codec looks like. We will evaluate the possibilities we have with various description options and we will also look at the overhead generated by the DIA description.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Roads","Remotely operated vehicles","Mobile robots","Navigation","Testing","Detection algorithms","Vehicle detection","Automotive engineering","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","multimedia systems","video streaming","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-network adaption","MC-EZBC","universal multimedia access","MPEG-21","scalable wavelet codec","digital item adaptation","scalable content"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297743","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289328/5297612/05297743.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost of in-network adaption of MC-EZBC for universal multimedia access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cost of in-network adaption of MC-EZBC for universal multimedia access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297743/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5297743/","accessionNumber":"10950930","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost of in-network adaption of MC-EZBC for universal multimedia access","confLoc":"Salzburg, Austria","sourcePdf":"031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041785S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289328","isNumber":"5297612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289328","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5297612","articleId":"5297743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5297757,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri I.

Usually, workload characterization is performed by measuring the type and amount of resources requested during a program execution (for instance the usage of CPU, I/O, network, etc.). The sequence of measures is then treated as a stochastic process and analyzed with statistical techniques. The novelty of our approach is that we instead use directly the sequence of memory references generated during the execution of a program. The sequences of memory references are treated as sequences of floating point numbers, and analyzed with signal processing techniques. In the feature extraction phase we use spectral analysis while in the pattern matching phase we use ergodic continuous hidden Markov models (ECHMMs). The ECHMM models estimated in an initial training phase can be used both for online workload classification of a running process and for synthetic traces generation. Several processes of the same workload are necessary to obtain an HMM model of the workload. The proposed algorithms is evaluated via trace driven simulations using the SPEC 2000 workloads. We show that ECHMMs describe address memory sequences; average classification accuracy is about 76% with eight different workloads.","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297771","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289328/5297612/05297771.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic Continuous Hidden Markov Models for workload characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5297771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297771/","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic Continuous Hidden Markov Models for workload characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10950967","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5297771/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic Continuous Hidden Markov Models for workload characterization","confLoc":"Salzburg, Austria","sourcePdf":"019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06793S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289328","isNumber":"5297612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289328","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5297612","articleId":"5297771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5297781,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Khaleel","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Khaleel","id":"37689972300"},{"name":"Claudio Pastrone","affiliation":["Instituto Superior Mario Boella, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Pastrone","id":"37427692400"},{"name":"Federico Penna","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Penna","id":"37392065600"},{"name":"Maurizio A.

The analysis of this paper is based on experimental measurements carried out using an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor network (WSN) node with Wi-Fi interference at different traffic rates. Three propagation environments are considered: an anechoic chamber, a realistic indoor environment with negligible background interference, and the same environment with high background interference. The measured data are analyzed in terms of energy probability distributions and spectrograms, to characterize the occupation of the IEEE 802.15.4 channels from a statistical and temporal perspective.

Micromachined gyroscopes are known to be especially challenging to develop and commercialize due to high sensitivity of their dynamic response to fabrication and environmental variations. Meeting performance specifications in the demanding automotive environment with low-cost and high-yield devices requires a very robust microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensing element. This paper reviews the design trend in structural implementations that provides inherent robustness against structural and environmental parameter variations at the sensing element level. The fundamental approach is based on obtaining a gain and phase stable region in the frequency response of the sense-mode dynamical system in order to achieve overall system robustness. Operating in the stable sense frequency region provides improved bias stability, temperature stability, and immunity to environmental and fabrication variations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297817/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","volume":"9","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10974134","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5297817/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Environmentally Robust MEMS Vibratory Gyroscopes for Automotive Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environmentally Robust MEMS Vibratory Gyroscopes for Automotive Applications","sourcePdf":"jsen-cacar-2026466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09646S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5290388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5290388","articleId":"5297817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":5297818,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Balaban","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5290388/5297818/5297818-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Edward Balaban (M'08) received the B.S. degree in computer science from The George Washington University, Washington, DC, in 1996 and the MS. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 1997.","He is a Researcher in the Diagnosis and System Health Group at NASA Ames Research Center.

At the same time, few recorded instances of sensor faults exist. It is equally difficult to seed particular sensor faults. Therefore, research is underway to better understand the different fault modes seen in sensors and to model the faults. The fault models can then be used in simulated sensor fault scenarios to ensure that algorithms can distinguish between sensor faults and system faults. The paper illustrates the work with data collected from an electromechanical actuator in an aerospace setting, equipped with temperature, vibration, current, and position sensors. The most common sensor faults, such as bias, drift, scaling, and dropout were simulated and injected into the experimental data, with the goal of making these simulations as realistic as feasible. A neural network-based classifier was then created and tested on both experimental data and the more challenging randomized data sequences. Additional studies were also conducted to determine sensitivity of detection and disambiguation efficacy with respect to severity of fault conditions.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2030284","startPage":"1907","endPage":"1917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2030284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5290388/05297818.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling, Detection, and Disambiguation of Sensor Faults for Aerospace Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5297818/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling, Detection, and Disambiguation of Sensor Faults for Aerospace Applications","volume":"9","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5297818/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10974135","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling, Detection, and Disambiguation of Sensor Faults for Aerospace Applications","sourcePdf":"jsen-ebalaban-2030284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071988S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5290388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5290388","articleId":"5297818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5298253,"authors":[{"name":"Fotis T.

On the other hand several physical layer mechanisms such as adaptive modulation, multiple-input multiple output systems, advanced channel coding and/or combinations of them enhance the capacity of wireless networks. However little effort has been put till now in studying the performance gains of physical layer mechanisms with the presence of cognition capabilities. The incorporation of cognitive mechanisms demands more detailed studies for assessing the impact on the spectral efficiency. To this direction, cross-layer combination of such a physical layer with upper layers should be also considered as a case study in a cognitive wireless environment. In this work we present a study on the spectral efficiency of adaptive modulation and coding which is one of the most promising schemes of applying cognitive radio at the physical layer. Besides, we study a cross-layer combination of adaptive modulation with upper layers in the same cognitive context. We prove that the performance gain of cognitive radio over such a physical layer is not negligible.","doi":"10.1109/PCI.2009.36","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5298189/5298190/05298253.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5298190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCI.2009.36","publicationTitle":"2009 13th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on the Performance of Adaptive Modulation and Cross-Layer Design in Cognitive Radio for Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5298253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Study on the Performance of Adaptive Modulation and Cross-Layer Design in Cognitive Radio for Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5298253/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5298253/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951615","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on the Performance of Adaptive Modulation and Cross-Layer Design in Cognitive Radio for Fading Channels","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"3788a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068653S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5298189","isNumber":"5298190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5298189","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5298190","articleId":"5298253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5298434,"authors":[{"name":"Susanna Teppola","affiliation":["Technical Research Centre of Finland, VTT, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Susanna","lastName":"Teppola","id":"38111256100"},{"name":"P\u00e4ivi Parviainen","affiliation":["Technical Research Centre of Finland, VTT, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"P\u00e4ivi","lastName":"Parviainen","id":"37597711200"},{"name":"Juha Takalo","affiliation":["Technical Research Centre of Finland, VTT, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Takalo","id":"37266916800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4779-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3777-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5298434","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":503},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Model driven engineering","Product development","Software engineering","Visualization","Scattering","Concrete","Testing","Productivity","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software engineering","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven development","development artifacts","source code","model transformations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model driven development","development process support"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5298434","doi":"10.1109/ICSEA.2009.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEA.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5298193","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","pdfPath":"/iel5/5298192/5298193/05298434.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges in Deployment of Model Driven Development","abstract":"Model-driven development (MDD) is an approach that focuses on creating models as first class development artifacts to produce source code by utilizing model transformations.

However, respondents found the approach useful and state that in the next five years the product development processes, methods and tools will be developed towards MDD adoption in their organizations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5298434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5298434/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951647","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Challenges in Deployment of Model Driven Development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges in Deployment of Model Driven Development","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3777a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050961S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5298192","isNumber":"5298193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5298192","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5298193","articleId":"5298434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5298438,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o de Sousa Saraiva","firstName":"Jo\u00e3o de Sousa","lastName":"Saraiva","id":"37089118499"},{"name":"Alberto Rodrigues da Silva","firstName":"Alberto Rodrigues da","lastName":"Silva","id":"37307959400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4779-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3777-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5298438","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"abstract":"Content management systems (CMS) are typically regarded as critical software platforms for the success of organizational web sites and intranets. Although most current CMS systems allow their extension through the addition of modules/components, these are usually built using the typical source-code-oriented software development process, which is slow and error-prone. On the other hand, a MDE-oriented development process is centered on models, which represent the system and are used to automatically generate all corresponding artifacts, such as source-code and documentation. This paper describes our proposal for a MDE approach to address the development of web-applications based on CMS systems. This approach is based on the creation of two CMS-oriented languages (situated at different levels of abstraction, and are used to both quickly model a web-application and provide a common ground for the creation of additional CMS-oriented languages), and a mechanism for the processing of models specified using those languages. Those models are then to be deployed to a target CMS platform by means of code generation or model interpretation/execution mechanisms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision mitigation","Content management","Model driven engineering","Documentation","Electrochemical machining","Software engineering","Proposals","Internet","Conference management","Software development management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content management","Internet","intranets","simulation languages","software engineering","source coding","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["World Wide Web","model-driven languages","content management systems","critical software","Web sites","intranets","source-code-oriented software development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Design","Software Construction","Software Engineering Tools and Methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSEA.2009.12","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","pdfPath":"/iel5/5298192/5298193/05298438.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5298193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEA.2009.12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMS-Based Web-Application Development Using Model-Driven Languages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5298438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CMS-Based Web-Application Development Using Model-Driven Languages","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5298438/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5298438/","accessionNumber":"10951648","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMS-Based Web-Application Development Using Model-Driven Languages","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3777a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085538S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5298192","isNumber":"5298193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5298192","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5298193","articleId":"5298438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5298439,"authors":[{"name":"Pekka Aho","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Aho","id":"37706146500"},{"name":"Janne Merilinna","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Merilinna","id":"38054902400"},{"name":"Eila Ovaska","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Eila","lastName":"Ovaska","id":"37545671800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4779-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3777-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5298439","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5298439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Open source software","Programming","Availability","Unified modeling language","Productivity","Software development management","Web services","Software systems","Application software","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["groupware","public domain software","software metrics","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven open source software","software development","open models","model-driven development","software complexity","collaborative MDD","resource availability service","Web service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MDA","OSS","UML"]}],"abstract":"Model-driven development (MDD) aims to increase productivity in software development and manage the complexity of software by utilizing modelling to shift from programming in solution-space to modelling in problem-space. Another approach to increase productivity and experience significant cost savings is to utilize open source (OS) components in software development. This paper presents the state of the art of how to combine MDD methods with OS software development. The approach is called open models software development which is expected to combine the benefits of both worlds. The fundamental idea of open models development is to apply community-driven collaborative MDD. In this paper, open models development is exemplified by constructing resource availability service (RAS). RAS is a web service for providing availability information about resources such as services, content, users and terminals. This paper shows that Open Models development is feasible from technical point of view although there are still great challenges in tooling. In addition, more empirical research is needed in studying attractiveness of open models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5298193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEA.2009.37","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","pdfPath":"/iel5/5298192/5298193/05298439.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"190","doi":"10.1109/ICSEA.2009.37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Open Source Software Development - The Open Models Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Open Source Software Development - The Open Models Approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5298439/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951649","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5298439/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Open Source Software Development - The Open Models Approach","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3777a185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138393S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5298192","isNumber":"5298193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5298192","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5298193","articleId":"5298439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5298628,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Mitola III","affiliation":["Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Mitola III","id":"37372877100"},{"name":"Hong Man","affiliation":["Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Man","id":"37267396700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4962-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3800-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5298628","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Signal processing","Business","Radio spectrum management","Logic","Gold","Digital signal processing","Streaming media","Quality of service","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cognitive radio","distributed processing","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","social contracts","business logic","behavioral semantics","IEEE P1900.5 policy language","cognitive linguistics","human language acquisition","Semantic Signal Processing Language","ontology","self-aware policy","user-aware policy","distributed agent behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","semantic signal processing","policy language","spectrum management","business logic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5298628","doi":"10.1109/ICSC.2009.82","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing","abstract":"This paper characterizes key semantics issues in shaping cognitive radio behavior to realize social contracts and business logic via cognitive radio behavioral semantics, with an immediate need for IEEE P1900.5 policy languages.

Requirements Engineering plays a important role regarding software quality, since it deals with the clear definition of the target system's scope. Moreover, Requirements Engineering is crucial to deal with change management, which is required to ensure that the final product reflects the stakeholders' expectations, namely the client and end-users business-related needs. We advocate the need to address the open issues regarding the requirements development process, namely to mitigate the drawbacks of using informal natural language, such as ambiguity and inconsistency. Moreover, we recognize the importance of automation to enhance productivity by avoiding repetitive and error-prone activities. In this paper, we propose a new socio-technical approach to overcome these software quality problems, consisting on the deep integration of Requirements Engineering with Model-Driven Engineering processes. This approach is based upon a controlled natural language for requirements specification, supporting the automatic extraction and verification of requirements models with Natural Language Processing techniques. The current results consist on the development of a Wiki-based tool prototype to validate our research ideas.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5298193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEA.2009.81","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","pdfPath":"/iel5/5298192/5298193/05298763.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"523","doi":"10.1109/ICSEA.2009.81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Controlled Natural Language Approach for Integrating Requirements and Model-Driven Engineering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Controlled Natural Language Approach for Integrating Requirements and Model-Driven Engineering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5298763/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951699","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5298763/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Controlled Natural Language Approach for Integrating Requirements and Model-Driven Engineering","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3777a518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13174S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5298192","isNumber":"5298193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5298192","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5298193","articleId":"5298763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5298765,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Riveiro","affiliation":["Informatics Research Centre, University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Riveiro","id":"37546992500"},{"name":"G\u00f6ran Falkman","affiliation":["Informatics Research Centre, University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden"],"firstName":"G\u00f6ran","lastName":"Falkman","id":"37546995300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3789-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5298765","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Humans","Data mining","Surveillance","Sensor systems","Monitoring","Data security","National security","Computer graphics","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data mining","data visualisation","embedded systems","expert systems","marine engineering","security of data","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive visualization","normal behavioral models","maritime surveillance systems","heterogeneous sensor data","autonomous anomaly detection systems","human expert knowledge system","embedded system","data mining","association rules mining","data analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interactive visualization","normal behavioral models","rules/signatures","anomaly detection","visual analytics","data mining","maritime situation awareness","AIS data"]}],"abstract":"Maritime surveillance systems analyze vast amounts of heterogeneous sensor data from a large number of objects. In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process. In order to support the comprehension of the knowledge embedded in the system, we propose an interactive way of visualizing expert rules and normal behavioral models built from the data. The overall goal is to facilitate the validation and update of these models and signatures, supporting the insertion of human expert knowledge while improving confidence and trust in the system.","doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2009.54","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization","pdfPath":"/iel5/5298185/5298186/05298765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2009.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5298186","startPage":"459","endPage":"466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Visualization of Normal Behavioral Models and Expert Rules for Maritime Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5298765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Visualization of Normal Behavioral Models and Expert Rules for Maritime Anomaly Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5298765/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951582","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5298765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Visualization of Normal Behavioral Models and Expert Rules for Maritime Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"3789a459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091277S","chronDate":"11-14 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5298185","isNumber":"5298186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5298185","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5298186","articleId":"5298765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5298766,"authors":[{"name":"Charalampos S.

A number of renewable energy technologies are now commercially available, the most notable being wind power, photovoltaic, solar thermal systems, biomass, and various forms of hydraulic power. In this paper, a methodology has been proposed for optimally allocating different types of renewable distributed generation (DG) units in the distribution system so as to minimize annual energy loss. The methodology is based on generating a probabilistic generation-load model that combines all possible operating conditions of the renewable DG units with their probabilities, hence accommodating this model in a deterministic planning problem. The planning problem is formulated as mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), with an objective function for minimizing the system's annual energy losses. The constraints include the voltage limits, the feeders' capacity, the maximum penetration limit, and the discrete size of the available DG units. This proposed technique has been applied to a typical rural distribution system with different scenarios, including all possible combinations of the renewable DG units.

Formerly reported front-end circuit concepts for wireless sensor readout, i.e., phase dip measurement and the dip meter, are subsequently discussed. It is shown that, due to fundamental system limitations, the formerly reported circuit concepts are not applicable if the distance between the sensor and the readout electronic circuit becomes too small, resulting in large coupling coefficients. Therefore, we present an improved concept for an analog front-end circuit of the readout system that overcomes these limitations and hence allows wireless sensor readout under a wider range of operating distances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Readout of Passive <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Sensors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2032966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5545546/05299019.pdf","startPage":"2450","endPage":"2457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2032966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5545546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Readout of Passive <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Sensors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11464115","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Readout of Passive <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Sensors","sourcePdf":"tim-nopper-2032966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040726S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","isNumber":"5545546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"111","articleId":"5299019","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5299022,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Xueqiang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xueqiang","id":"38110974100"},{"name":"Pan Liyang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Liyang","id":"37428690800"},{"name":"Wu Dong","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Dong","id":"37415372000"},{"name":"Hu Chaohong","affiliation":["Intel Technology Development, Shanghai Company Limited, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Chaohong","id":"37270838600"},{"name":"Zhou Runde","affiliation":["Intel Technol.

A novel fast-decoding algorithm is developed to speed up the BCH decoding process using iteration-free solutions and division-free transformations in finite fields. As a result, the decoding latency is significantly reduced by 80%. Furthermore, a novel architecture of a two-cell decoder that is suitable for an MLC flash memory is proposed to obtain a good time-area tradeoff.

This difficulty is compounded by the variable nature of the load resistance presented by a device under charge. This brief considers component selection for a specific wireless power system architecture, which is an open-loop class-e inverter using a series-parallel arrangement for load impedance transformation. Formulas for the optimal receiver, transmitter, and class-e components are derived given a set of constraints on the resistance, phase, quality factor, and drain voltage waveform. Using a 16 cm times 18 cm primary and a 4 cm times 5 cm secondary coil, the derived formulas are used to build a wireless power system. We show that the system has desirable performance characteristics, including a power delivery of over 3.7 W, peak efficiency of over 66%, and decreasing power delivery with increasing load resistance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Optimization of a Class-E Amplifier for a Loosely Coupled Planar Wireless Power System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2009.2032465","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5337790/05299023.pdf","startPage":"830","endPage":"834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2009.2032465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimization of a Class-E Amplifier for a Loosely Coupled Planar Wireless Power System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5299023/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978218","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Optimization of a Class-E Amplifier for a Loosely Coupled Planar Wireless Power System","sourcePdf":"tcsii-casanova-2032465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5337790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5337790","articleId":"5299023","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5299025,"authors":[{"name":"Ayush Bhandari","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ayush","lastName":"Bhandari","id":"37701191800"},{"name":"Pina Marziliano","affiliation":["Division of Information Engineering, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pina","lastName":"Marziliano","id":"37266226400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5299025","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1410},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Sampling theory for continuous time signals which have a bandlimited representation in fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) domain-a transformation which generalizes the conventional Fourier transform-has blossomed in the recent past. The mechanistic principles behind Shannon's sampling theorem for fractional bandlimited (or fractional Fourier bandlimited) signals are the same as for the Fourier domain case i.e. sampling (and reconstruction) in FrFT domain can be seen as an orthogonal projection of a signal onto a subspace of fractional bandlimited signals. As neat as this extension of Shannon's framework is, it inherits the same fundamental limitation that is prevalent in the Fourier regime-what happens if the signals have singularities in the time domain (or the signal has a nonbandlimited spectrum)? In this paper, we propose a uniform sampling and reconstruction scheme for a class of signals which are nonbandlimited in FrFT sense. Specifically, we assume that samples of a smoothed version of a periodic stream of Diracs (which is sparse in time-domain) are accessible.

Based on the representation of this signal in FrFT domain, we derive conditions under which exact recovery of parameters of the signal is possible.

This can be seen as a result from the relative simplicity and flexibility of this particular method. However, the associated computational costs constitute a well known drawback of image-source implementations, as the required simulation times grow exponentially with the considered reflection order. This paper proposes a method that allows for a fast synthesis of room impulse responses according to the image-source technique. This is achieved by modeling the diffuse reverberation tail as decaying random noise, where the decay envelope for the considered acoustic environment is determined according to a recently proposed method for the prediction of energy decay curves in image-source simulations. The diffuse reverberation model presented in this paper thus produces impulse responses that are representative of the specific virtual environment under consideration (within the general assumptions of geometrical room acoustics), in contrast to other artificial reverberation techniques developed on the basis of perceptual measures or assuming a purely exponential energy decay. Furthermore, since image-source simulations are only used for the computation of the early reflections, the proposed approach achieves a reduction of the computational requirements by up to two orders of magnitude for the simulation of full-length room impulse responses, compared to a standard image-source implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299028/","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5299028/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11473533","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diffuse Reverberation Model for Efficient Image-Source Simulation of Room Impulse Responses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffuse Reverberation Model for Efficient Image-Source Simulation of Room Impulse Responses","sourcePdf":"18tasl03-elehmann-2035038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114982S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5508665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5508665","articleId":"5299028","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5299034,"authors":[{"name":"Anh-Tuan Do","affiliation":["Center of Integrated Circuits and Systems CICS, School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5695105/5299034/5299034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anh-Tuan Do was born in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1984.

Extensive post-layout simulations, based on an industry standard 1 V/65-nm CMOS technology, have verified that the new design outperforms other designs in comparison by at least 27% in terms of speed and 30% in terms of power consumption. Sensitivity analysis has proven that the new design offers the best reliability with the smallest standard deviation and bit-error-rate (BER). Four 32 \u00d7 32-bit SRAM macros have been used to validate the proposed design, in comparison with three other circuit topologies. The new design can operate at a maximum frequency of 1.25 GHz at 1 V supply voltage and a minimum supply voltage of 0.2 V.

The IR-based apparatuses have an optical-fiber input/output interface board that supports multi protocol signals (OC-192 and 10 GbE) and that implements a forward error correction (FEC), enabling 10-Gb/s data transmission both in space and fiber seamlessly. Analyzing an IR-based receiver model with simple on/off demodulation architecture, required signal-to-noise ratios were calculated for IR-based systems affected by various inter-symbol interference (ISI) levels. A millimeter-wave module used in the transmitter, consisting of a 6.5-ps pulse modulator with InP-based HEMTs and a band-pass filter formed on an alumina substrate, emitted wavelets, or RF pulses, with an average power of -26 dBm, occupying frequencies between 78-93 GHz. A front-end module used in the receiver, consisting of two cascaded low-noise amplifiers, an envelope detector, and a limiting amplifier, had a sensitivity of -36 dBm. In a back-to-back test where the transmitter and receiver were connected by a waveguide, disabling the FEC, error-free operation was achieved with a test pattern of PRBS 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">31</sup>\n-1 at the OC-192 compliant data rate of 9.95328 Gb/s. Furthermore, using a horn antenna and enabling the FEC, radio transmission and reception in a distance of 20 cm were confirmed with a bit error rate of less than 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n.

Cells must be aspirated gently from a buffer before transferring to operation zone so as not to artificially perturb their biostructures. Vision-based manipulation is a key technique for allowing nondestructive cell transportation. In this paper, we presented a design for an automated single-cell loading and supply system that can be integrated with complex microfluidic applications for examining or processing one cell at a time such as the current nuclear transplantation method. The aim of the system is to automatically transfer mammalian donor (~ 15 \u00bfm) or oocyte (~ 100 \u00bf m) cells one by one from a container to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel and then transport them to other modules. The system consists of two main parts: a single-cell suction module, and a PDMS-based microfluidic chip controlled by an external pump. The desired number of vacuumed cells can be directed into the microfluidic chip and stored in a docking area. From the batch, they can be moved to next module by activating pneumatic pressure valves located on two sides of the chip. The entire mechanism is combined with monitoring systems that perform detection/tracking and control.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2009.2035280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel5/7728/5401109/05299060.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2009.2035280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-Based Automated Single-Cell Loading and Supply System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299060/","displayDocTitle":"Vision-Based Automated Single-Cell Loading and Supply System","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11105215","pubMedId":"19884102","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5299060/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-Based Automated Single-Cell Loading and Supply System","sourcePdf":"tnb-uvet-2035280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074647S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"5401109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5401109","articleId":"5299060","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299063,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Neumann","affiliation":["SAPHIR Team, Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5416606/5299063/5299063-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maxim Neumann (S'06) was born in Dsheskasgan, Kazakhstan.

A model is designed to combine a physical model-based polarimetric decomposition with the random-volume-over-ground (RVoG) PolInSAR parameter inversion approach. The combination of a polarimetric scattering media model with a PolInSAR RVoG vertical structure model provides the possibility to separate the ground and the volume coherency matrices based on polarimetric signatures and interferometric coherence diversity. The proposed polarimetric decomposition characterizes volumetric media by the degree of polarization orientation randomness and by the particle scattering anisotropy. Using the full model enhances the estimation of the vertical forest structure parameters by enabling us to estimate the ground-to-volume ratio, the temporal decorrelation, and the differential extinction. For forest vegetation observed at L-band, this model accounts for the ground topography, forest and canopy layer heights, wave attenuation in the canopy, tree morphology in the form of the angular distribution and the effective shapes of the branches, and the contributions from the ground level consisting of surface scattering and double-bounce ground-trunk interactions, as well as volumetric understory scattering. The parameter estimation performance is evaluated on real airborne L-band SAR data of the Traunstein test site, acquired by the German Aerospace Center (DLR)'s E-SAR sensor in 2003, in both single- and multibaseline configurations. The retrieved forest height is compared with the ground-truth measurements, revealing, for the given test site, an average root-mean-square error (rmse) of about 5 m in the repeat-pass configuration. This implies an improvement in rmse by over 2 m in comparison to the pure coherence-based RVoG PolInSAR parameter inversion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Forest Structure, Ground, and Canopy Layer Characteristics From Multibaseline Polarimetric Interferometric SAR Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416606/05299063.pdf","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Forest Structure, Ground, and Canopy Layer Characteristics From Multibaseline Polarimetric Interferometric SAR Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5299063/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138164","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Forest Structure, Ground, and Canopy Layer Characteristics From Multibaseline Polarimetric Interferometric SAR Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-neumann-2031101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118833S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"5416606","articleId":"5299063","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5299065,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5415848/5299065/5299065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Ding (S'03\u2013M'05) received the B.Eng. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2005, both in electrical engineering.","From 2000 to 2002, he was a Soft Engineer with Datang Telecom Inc., Beijing, and Vimicro Corporation, Beijing.

The large GPS measurement noise magnitude can be attributed to signal interference, jamming , or other factors, such as signal multipath. The proposed method makes use of the dynamics of the system measured by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the propagated residual of a GPS/IMU estimation filter to form a bank of statistics used to estimate the GPS measurement noise covariance. The method is used along an ultratightly coupled GPS/IMU filter to first estimate the measurement noise covariance matrix and then use this covariance matrix to obtain a high-accuracy and high-integrity state estimate.

Generally, wireless sensors are battery powered; therefore, it is crucial for them to efficiently use their battery resources. Most of the existing power-saving protocols achieve power savings by periodically putting sensor nodes to sleep. Such a regular sleep/awake mechanism fails to adjust a sensor node's sleep duration based on its traffic load, thus causing either lower power efficiency or higher latency. Furthermore, sensors may be deployed in hostile environments and may thus unexpectedly fail. Most power-saving protocols do not promptly react to such link breakage, resulting in long transmission delays. In this paper, we propose a quorum-based medium access control (QMAC) protocol that enables sensor nodes to sleep longer under light loads. Since traffic flows toward the sink node in wireless sensor networks, a new concept, i.e., the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">next-hop group</i>\n, is also proposed to reduce transmission latency.

Most existing methods for this problem only consider the design of the relay precoder, and some even ignore the direct link. In this paper, we consider a joint source/relay precoder design problem, taking both the direct and the relay links into account. Using a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion, we first formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem. However, it is found that the mean square error (MSE) is a highly nonlinear function of the precoders, and a direct optimization is difficult to conduct. We then design the precoders to diagonalize the MSE matrix in the cost function. To do that, we pose certain structural constraints on the precoders and derive an MSE upper bound. It turns out that minimization with respect to this bound becomes simple and straightforward. Using the standard Lagrange technique, we can finally obtain the solution with an iterative water-filling method. Simulation results show that the proposed method, with an additional precoder, outperforms the existing methods, in terms of either the MSE or the bit error rate (BER).","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2034971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05299069.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2034971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","startPage":"754","endPage":"765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear MMSE Transceiver Design in Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear MMSE Transceiver Design in Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299069/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149583","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5299069/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear MMSE Transceiver Design in Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-tseng-2034971.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090901S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5299069","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299071,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungjoon Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungjoon","lastName":"Song","id":"37343947900"},{"name":"Woohyun Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Woohyun","lastName":"Seo","id":"37295387700"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5299071","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":585},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Array signal processing","State feedback","Vector quantization","Base stations","Sparse matrices","Information technology","Matching pursuit algorithms","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel allocation","MIMO communication","sparse matrices","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive feedback","sparse approximation","multiuser MIMO system","multiple-input-multiple-output system","vector quantization codebook","channel state information","high-precision feedback technique","compression matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sampling","limited feedback","multiuser multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MU-MIMO)"]}],"abstract":"In multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, limited feedback schemes using a vector quantization codebook (VQC) for partial channel state information (CSI) can enable a base station (BS) to enhance the sum throughput at low feedback rates.

This paper considers a more-realistic network model where a known and fixed number of nodes are independently distributed in a given region and characterizes the distribution of the Euclidean internode distances. The key finding is that, when the nodes are uniformly randomly placed inside a ball of arbitrary dimensions, the probability density function (pdf) of the internode distances follows a generalized beta distribution.

We also consider the impact of imperfect CSI. An algorithm is then proposed based on the dual decomposition method to obtain the subcarrier assignment and power allocation for each user. Using simulations, we evaluate the impact of streaming traffic on the total achievable rate of elastic users for different values of the required outage probability. It is also shown by simulation that, by increasing the variance of CSI estimation, the total rate of elastic traffic is decreased.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2035131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05299077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2035131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems for Heterogeneous Traffic With Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems for Heterogeneous Traffic With Imperfect CSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149570","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5299077/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems for Heterogeneous Traffic With Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tvt-navaie-2035131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043093S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5299077","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299083,"authors":[{"name":"Amitava Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5415848/5299083/5299083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amitava Chatterjee received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 1991, 1994, and 2002, respectively.","Since 1997, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University, where he is currently a Reader.

The design of the step-size parameter is a critical consideration when we apply BSS to real-world applications such as robot audition systems, because the surrounding environment dynamically changes in the real world. It is common to use a fixed step-size parameter that was obtained empirically. However, because of environmental changes and noise, the performance of BSS with a fixed step-size parameter deteriorates and the separation matrix sometimes diverges. Several adaptive step-size methods for BSS have been proposed. However, there are difficulties when applying them to robot audition systems for example, low-computational cost requirements, being free from manual parameter adjustment and so on. We propose an adaptive step-size method suitable for robot audition systems. The proposed method has the following merits: 1) low computational cost; 2) no parameters to be adjusted manually; and 3) no additional preprocessing requirements. We applied our method to six different BSS algorithms for an eight-channel microphone array embedded in Honda's ASIMO robot. The method improved the performance of all six algorithms in experiments on separation and recognition of simultaneous speech. Moreover, the method increased the amount of calculation by less than 10% compared with the original calculation used in most BSS algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Source Separation With Parameter-Free Adaptive Step-Size Method for Robot Audition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2035219","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5508665/05299088.pdf","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2035219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Blind Source Separation With Parameter-Free Adaptive Step-Size Method for Robot Audition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5299088/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473515","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Source Separation With Parameter-Free Adaptive Step-Size Method for Robot Audition","sourcePdf":"18tasl03-hnakajima-2035219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068341S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5508665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5508665","articleId":"5299088","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299090,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Bian","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5382628/5299090/5299090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Bian is currently a Ph.D. student with the School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."]},"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Bian","id":"37604666100"},{"name":"Dacheng Tao","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5382628/5299090/5299090-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Dacheng Tao (M'07) received the B.Eng. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, the M.Phil. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of London, London, U.K.","Currently, he is a Nanyang Assistant Professor with the School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.

A wide variety of relevance feedback (RF) algorithms have been developed in recent years to improve the performance of CBIR systems. These RF algorithms capture user's preferences and bridge the semantic gap. However, there is still a big room to further the RF performance, because the popular RF algorithms ignore the manifold structure of image low-level visual features. In this paper, we propose the biased discriminative Euclidean embedding (BDEE) which parameterises samples in the original high-dimensional ambient space to discover the intrinsic coordinate of image low-level visual features. BDEE precisely models both the intraclass geometry and interclass discrimination and never meets the undersampled problem. To consider unlabelled samples, a manifold regularization-based item is introduced and combined with BDEE to form the semi-supervised BDEE, or semi-BDEE for short. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed BDEE and semi-BDEE, we compare them against the conventional RF algorithms and show a significant improvement in terms of accuracy and stability based on a subset of the Corel image gallery.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biased Discriminant Euclidean Embedding for Content-Based Image Retrieval","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2035223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5382628/05299090.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2035223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Biased Discriminant Euclidean Embedding for Content-Based Image Retrieval","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5299090/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070884","pubMedId":"19884084","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biased Discriminant Euclidean Embedding for Content-Based Image Retrieval","sourcePdf":"19tip02-dtao-2035223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077628S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5382628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5382628","articleId":"5299090","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299091,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep R.

Earlier hardware implementations suffer from major drawbacks such as absence of GA parameter programmability, rigid predefined system architecture, and lack of support for multiple fitness functions. In this paper, we report the design of an IP core that implements a general-purpose GA engine that addresses these problems. Specifically, the proposed GA IP core can be customized in terms of the population size, number of generations, crossover and mutation rates, random number generator seed, and the fitness function. It has been successfully synthesized and verified on a Xilinx Virtex II Pro Field programmable gate arrays device (xc2vp30-7ff896) with only 13% logic slice utilization, 1% block memory utilization for GA memory, and a clock speed of 50 MHz. The GA core has been used as a search engine for real-time adaptive healing but can be tailored to any given application by interfacing with the appropriate application-specific fitness evaluation module as well as the required storage memory and by programming the values of the desired GA parameters. The core is soft in nature i.e., a gate-level netlist is provided which can be readily integrated with the user's system. The performance of the GA core was tested using standard optimization test functions. In the hardware experiments, the proposed core either found the globally optimum solution or found a solution that was within 3.7% of the value of the globally optimal solution. The experimental test setup including the GA core achieved a speedup of around 5.16\u00d7 over an analogous software implementation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5401131/05299091.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Customizable FPGA IP Core Implementation of a General-Purpose Genetic Algorithm Engine","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2009.2025032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2009.2025032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Customizable FPGA IP Core Implementation of a General-Purpose Genetic Algorithm Engine","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11088364","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5299091/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customizable FPGA IP Core Implementation of a General-Purpose Genetic Algorithm Engine","sourcePdf":"tevc-skatkoori-2025032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097963S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5401131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5401131","articleId":"5299091","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299092,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Kumar","affiliation":["Prognostics and Health Management Laboratory, Center of Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE), University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5508591/5299092/5299092-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sachin Kumar (M'07) received the B.S. degree in metallurgical engineering from Bihar Institute of Technology, Sindri, India, and the M.Tech. degree in reliability engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India.

A technique for detecting trends and biasness in system health is presented by constructing a control chart for the MD value. The performance parameters' residuals, which are the differences between the estimated values (from an empirical model) and the observed values (from health monitoring), are used to isolate parameters that exhibit faults. To aid in the qualification of a product against a specific known fault, we suggest that a fault-specific threshold MD value be defined by minimizing an error function.

Multiresolution transforms, such as pyramid decomposition and wavelet, are usually used to solve this problem. In this paper, a sparse representation-based multifocus image fusion method is proposed. In the method, first, the source image is represented with sparse coefficients using an overcomplete dictionary. Second, the coefficients are combined with the choose-max fusion rule. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed from the combined sparse coefficients and the dictionary. Furthermore, the proposed fusion scheme can simultaneously resolve the image restoration and fusion problem by changing the approximate criterion in the sparse representation algorithm. The proposed method is compared with spatial gradient (SG)-, morphological wavelet transform (MWT)-, discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-, stationary wavelet transform (SWT)-, curvelet transform (CVT)-, and nonsubsampling contourlet transform (NSCT)-based methods on several pairs of multifocus images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better in both subjective and objective qualities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5427296/05299095.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2026612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2026612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multifocus Image Fusion and Restoration With Sparse Representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Image restoration","Discrete wavelet transforms","Spatial resolution","Dictionaries","Focusing","Fuses","Wavelet transforms","Image reconstruction","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curvelet transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","image fusion","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multifocus image fusion","multifocus image restoration","sparse representation","multiresolution transforms","pyramid decomposition","spatial gradient","morphological wavelet transform","discrete wavelet transform","stationary wavelet transform","curvelet transform","nonsubsampling contourlet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","image restoration","sparse representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multifocus Image Fusion and Restoration With Sparse Representation","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5299095/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168671","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multifocus Image Fusion and Restoration With Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"tim-li-2026612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077448S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5427296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"381","xplore-issue":"5427296","articleId":"5299095","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5299100,"authors":[{"name":"Tsu-Wei Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5471724/5299100/5299100-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsu-Wei Tseng received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Fu-Jen Catholic University, HsinChuang, Taiwan, in 2003.

This paper presents a reconfigurable BISR (ReBISR) scheme for repairing RAMs with different sizes and redundancy organizations. An efficient redundancy analysis algorithm is proposed to allocate redundancies of defective RAMs. In the ReBISR, a reconfigurable built-in redundancy analysis (ReBIRA) circuit is designed to perform the redundancy algorithm for various RAMs. Also, an adaptively reconfigurable fusing methodology is proposed to reduce the repair setup time when the RAMs are operated in normal mode. Experimental results show that the ReBISR scheme can achieve high repair rate (i.e., the ratio of the number of repaired RAMs to the number of defective RAMs). The area cost of the ReBISR is very small, which is only about 2.7% for four RAMs (one 4 Kbit RAM, one 16 Kbit RAM, one 128 Kbit RAM, and one 512 Kbit RAM). Moreover, the time overhead of redundancy analysis is very small. For example, the ratio of the redundancy analysis time to the test time for a 512 Kbit RAM tested by a March-14 test with solid data backgrounds is only about 0.25%. On the other hand, the proposed fusing scheme can achieve about 86.94% reduction of repair setup time in comparison with a typical fusing scheme for 20 512 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 64-bit RAMs of which each RAM has one spare row and one spare column.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2017906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5471724/05299100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2017906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5471724","startPage":"921","endPage":"932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ReBISR: A Reconfigurable Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Random Access Memories in SOCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ReBISR: A Reconfigurable Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Random Access Memories in SOCs","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11308172","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5299100/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ReBISR: A Reconfigurable Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Random Access Memories in SOCs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jli-2017906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088204S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5471724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5471724","articleId":"5299100","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299101,"authors":[{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5673483/5299101/5299101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saibal Mukhopadhyay (S'99\u2013M'07)) received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2006.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.

The parameters of the model are estimated from input-output data collected using portable temperature loggers, which are temporarily installed in the building to monitor the room temperatures during a short commissioning period of one or two weeks. The performance of the control scheme in different heating systems is investigated using a heating system simulator, which had been developed and validated in previous projects. The simulation results show that the control scheme can significantly improve the overall performance of heating systems compared with conventional boiler control schemes and is easy to commission.

However, the susceptibility of sub-threshold SRAM cells to soft errors is high due to their low supply voltage, high density, and shrinking geometry. Moreover, the increase in statistical variations in advanced nanometer CMOS technologies poses a major challenge for sub-threshold circuits designers. In this paper, analytical models for the sub-threshold SRAM critical charge variations, which account for both die-to-die (D2D) and within-die (WID) variations, are proposed. The derived models are then compared with Monte Carlo simulations by using industrial hardware-calibrated 65-nm CMOS technology. This paper also provides novel design insights such as the impact of the coupling capacitor, one of the most common soft error mitigation techniques, on the critical charge variability. In addition, it demonstrates that the relative critical charge variability is minimum at a certain temperature value. Then, the circuit designer can employ these results with temperature control techniques to minimize the critical charge variability in the early design cycles, especially, for applications with strict soft error rate (SER) constraints. In Zaddition, the proposed models show that the device sub-threshold swing coefficient can be optimized to minimize the relative critical charge variability.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2033697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2033697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5695105/05299107.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Soft Error Models Accounting for Die-to-Die and Within-Die Variations in Sub-Threshold SRAM Cells","volume":"19","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11762129","htmlLink":"/document/5299107/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Soft Error Models Accounting for Die-to-Die and Within-Die Variations in Sub-Threshold SRAM Cells","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mostafa-2033697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145671S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5695105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5695105","articleId":"5299107","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299111,"authors":[{"name":"Jose-Maria Molina-Garcia-Pardo","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose-Maria","lastName":"Molina-Garcia-Pardo","id":"37267388300"},{"name":"Martine Lienard","affiliation":["IEMN/TELICE, Electronics Department, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Martine","lastName":"Lienard","id":"37277919400"},{"name":"Pierre Degauque","affiliation":["IEMN/TELICE, Electronics Department, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Degauque","id":"37277935200"},{"name":"Concepcin Garcia-Pardo","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Concepcin","lastName":"Garcia-Pardo","id":"37545635500"},{"name":"Leandro Juan-Llacer","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Juan-Llacer","id":"38260182200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5299111","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Polarization","Signal to noise ratio","Roads","Rail transportation","Transmitters","Technological innovation","Information technology","Electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microwave antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel capacity","polarization diversity","road tunnels","railway tunnels","incident electric fields","microwave antenna arrays","frequency 2.8 GHz to 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","polarization diversity","tunnel"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies the possible application of MIMO polarization diversity in road/railway tunnels.

It has a number of advantages over the prior art. First, it does not introduce extra voltage and current stress on the main switch. Second, it provides soft-switching conditions for the main switch over wide input and load range. Third, it limits the turn- on current of the main switch resulting from the reverse recovery current of the output diode. The operating principle of the proposed snubber and procedure of designing the component values are given. A comparative study into the performance characteristics between the prior-art passive lossless snubbers and the proposed snubber will be performed. The performance of the proposed snubber has been evaluated experimentally on a 750-W PFC with universal input. The boost converter is operated in continuous conduction mode and its input current is shaped by using average current-mode control. Experimental results show that soft switching of the main switch is maintained over 88% with an input of 110 V, 60 Hz, and 91.8% an the input of 220 V, 50 Hz, over one line cycle, and from full load to 20% load. The efficiencies of the PFC with unsnubbered hard switching, conventional resistor-capacitor-diode snubber, and proposed snubber will be compared. Results show that the proposed snubber can significantly improve the efficiency over the designed operating range.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5440038/05299121.pdf","startPage":"602","endPage":"613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive Lossless Snubber for Boost PFC With Minimum Voltage and Current Stress","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2035123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2035123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Passive Lossless Snubber for Boost PFC With Minimum Voltage and Current Stress","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11208092","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5299121/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive Lossless Snubber for Boost PFC With Minimum Voltage and Current Stress","sourcePdf":"tpel-chung-2035123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095653S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5440038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5440038","articleId":"5299121","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299149,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Engineering Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5416603/5299149/5299149-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Wang was born in Jilin, China, in July 1979.

Because the proposed MILS algorithm uses \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n innovations (not only the current innovation but also past innovations) at each iteration (with the integer p > 1 being an innovation length), the accuracy of parameter estimation is improved, compared with that of the RLS algorithm. Performance analysis and simulation results show that the proposed MILS algorithm is consistently convergent. Moreover, a new interval-varying MILS algorithm is proposed, for which the key is to dynamically change the interval in order to deal with cases where some measurement data are missing. Furthermore, an auxiliary-model-based MILS algorithm is derived for pseudolinear models corresponding to output error moving average systems with colored noises. Finally, the proposed algorithms are applied to model an experimental water level control system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modeling","Technological innovation","Resonance light scattering","Linear regression","Vectors","Parameter estimation","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Colored noise","Level control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","parameter estimation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiinnovation least-squares identification","system modeling","linear regression models","parameter vectors","recursive least-squares","RLS algorithm","performance analysis","auxiliary-model-based MILS algorithm","colored noises","water level control system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convergence properties","least squares (LS)","multiinnovation identification","parameter estimation","recursive identification","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Least-Squares Analysis","Models, Statistical"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2028871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05299173.pdf","startPage":"767","endPage":"778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2028871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiinnovation Least-Squares Identification for System Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiinnovation Least-Squares Identification for System Modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299173/","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5299173/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11293048","pubMedId":"19884093","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiinnovation Least-Squares Identification for System Modeling","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-ding-2028871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106841S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5299173","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":5299175,"authors":[{"name":"Mingli Song","affiliation":["Microsoft Visual Perception Laboratory, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5299175/5299175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingli Song (S'04\u2013M'06) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Microsoft Visual Perception Laboratory, Zhejiang University.

To target this problem, texture features have been extracted and widely used, because they can capture image intensity changes raised by skin deformation. However, existing texture features encounter problems with albedo and lighting variations. To solve both problems, we propose a new texture feature called image ratio features. Compared with previously proposed texture features, e.g., high gradient component features, image ratio features are more robust to albedo and lighting variations. In addition, to further improve facial expression recognition accuracy based on image ratio features, we combine image ratio features with facial animation parameters (FAPs), which describe the geometric motions of facial feature points. The performance evaluation is based on the Carnegie Mellon University Cohn-Kanade database, our own database, and the Japanese Female Facial Expression database. Experimental results show that the proposed image ratio feature is more robust to albedo and lighting variations, and the combination of image ratio features and FAPs outperforms each feature alone. In addition, we study asymmetric facial expressions based on our own facial expression database and demonstrate the superior performance of our combined expression recognition system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299175/","volume":"40","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5299175/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293045","pubMedId":"19884092","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Image Ratio Features for Facial Expression Recognition Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Ratio Features for Facial Expression Recognition Application","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-tao-2029076-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106822S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5299175","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5299179,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Biglarbegian","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5299179/5299179-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Biglarbegian (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree (with honors) in mechanical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2002 and the M.A.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2005.

This paper proposes a novel inference mechanism for an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic control system (IT2 TSK FLCS) when antecedents are type-2 fuzzy sets and consequents are crisp numbers (A2-C0). The proposed inference mechanism has a closed form which makes it more feasible to analyze the stability of this FLCS. This paper focuses on control applications for the following cases: 1) Both plant and controller use A2-C0 TSK models, and 2) the plant uses type-1 Takagi-Sugeno (TS) and the controller uses IT2 TS models. In both cases, sufficient stability conditions for the stability of the closed-loop system are derived. Furthermore, novel linear-matrix-inequality-based algorithms are developed for satisfying the stability conditions. Numerical analyses are included which validate the effectiveness of the new inference methods. Case studies reveal that an IT2 TS FLCS using the proposed inference engine clearly outperforms its type-1 TSK counterpart. Moreover, due to the simple nature of the proposed inference engine, it is easy to implement in real-time control systems. The methods presented in this paper lay the mathematical foundations for analyzing the stability and facilitating the design of stabilizing controllers of IT2 TSK FLCSs and IT2 TS FLCSs with significantly improved performance over type-1 approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Stability of Interval Type-2 TSK Fuzzy Logic Control Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2029986","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05299179.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2029986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Stability of Interval Type-2 TSK Fuzzy Logic Control Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5299179/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293050","pubMedId":"19884090","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Stability of Interval Type-2 TSK Fuzzy Logic Control Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-melek-2029986-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09999S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5299179","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299181,"authors":[{"name":"Yongcan Cao","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5299181/5299181-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongcan Cao (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006.

This paper studies optimal linear-consensus algorithms for multivehicle systems with single-integrator dynamics in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. We propose two global cost functions, namely, interaction-free and interaction-related cost functions. With the interaction-free cost function, we derive the optimal (nonsymmetric) Laplacian matrix by using a linear-quadratic-regulator-based method in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. It is shown that the optimal (nonsymmetric) Laplacian matrix corresponds to a complete directed graph. In addition, we show that any symmetric Laplacian matrix is inverse optimal with respect to a properly chosen cost function. With the interaction-related cost function, we derive the optimal scaling factor for a prespecified symmetric Laplacian matrix associated with the interaction graph in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. Illustrative examples are given as a proof of concept.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","volume":"40","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11293052","pubMedId":"19884088","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5299181/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Linear-Consensus Algorithms: An LQR Perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Linear-Consensus Algorithms: An LQR Perspective","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-ren-2030495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105808S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5299181","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5299186,"authors":[{"name":"Sing Kiong Nguang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Sing Kiong","lastName":"Nguang","id":"37347351800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"5299186","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":578},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"abstract":"The above paper gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n tracking controller for a class of nonlinear networked control systems.

The system relies on a single camera, does not require camera calibration, and works with a wide range of camera views. This is achieved by a formulation where the gait is self-calibrating. These properties make the proposed method particularly suitable for identification by gait, where the advantages of completely unobtrusiveness, remoteness, and covertness of the biometric system preclude the availability of camera information and specific walking directions. The approach has been assessed for feature extraction and recognition capabilities on the SOTON gait database and then evaluated on a multiview database to establish recognition capability with respect to view invariance. Moreover, tests on the multiview CASIA-B database, composed of more than 2270 video sequences with 65 different subjects walking freely along different walking directions, have been performed. The obtained results show that human identification by gait can be achieved without any knowledge of internal or external camera parameters with a mean correct classification rate of 73.6% across all views using purely dynamic gait features. The performance of the proposed method is particularly encouraging for application in surveillance scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11416565","htmlLink":"/document/5299188/","pubMedId":"19884085","displayDocTitle":"Self-Calibrating View-Invariant Gait Biometrics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Calibrating View-Invariant Gait Biometrics","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-bouchrika-2031091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111556S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5510034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"5510034","articleId":"5299188","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299200,"authors":[{"name":"Eckart Zitzler","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory (TIK), Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5401131/5299200/5299200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eckart Zitzler received the Diploma degree in computer science from the University of Dortmund, Germany, and Doctor of Technical Sciences degree from Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.","Since 2003, he has been Assistant Professor for Systemsg Optimization in the Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.

There is a vast amount of studies addressing these issues from different angles, but so far only a few studies can be found that consider all questions under one roof. This paper is an attempt to summarize recent developments in the EMO field within a unifying theory of set-based multiobjective search. It discusses how preference relations on sets can be formally defined, gives examples for selected user preferences, and proposes a general preference-independent hill climber for multiobjective optimization with theoretical convergence properties. Furthermore, it shows how to use set preference relations for statistical performance assessment and provides corresponding experimental results. The proposed methodology brings together preference articulation, algorithm design, and performance assessment under one framework and thereby opens up a new perspective on EMO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299200/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11162412","htmlLink":"/document/5299200/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Set-Based Multiobjective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Set-Based Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-zitzler-2016569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126451S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5401131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5401131","articleId":"5299200","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299204,"authors":[{"name":"Paul A. van Walree","affiliation":["Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, Netherlands","Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Horten, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/5308749/5299204/5299204-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul van Walree (M'08) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in solid-state physics from Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands, in 1992 and 1997, respectively.","From 1998 to 2009, he was an Underwater Acoustician at the Sonar Department, The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), The Netherlands. in 2009, he started as a Scientist with the Maritime Systems Department, Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), Horten, Norway.

User bits are put through a rate 1/3 turbo encoder and interleaved with periodic training bits. A maximal-length sequence is prefixed for signal detection and equalizer convergence, and the resulting bit stream is simultaneously modulated onto multiple phase-shift keyed carriers. Since each subband carries the same symbol sequence, the baseband ensemble is amenable to multichannel equalization. An adaptive multiband equalizer is thus constructed for joint equalization and despreading of the frequency bands. Iterative equalization using soft information from the turbo decoder further enhances the receiver performance. A reduction in complexity is achieved by equipping the subbands with separate recursive least squares tap updates, yet guided by a common error signal. The proposed algorithms are tested on acoustic data from the Baltic Sea, using eight subbands of 460 Hz each, at an effective data rate of 75 b/s. Robust receiver operation is demonstrated at overall receive SNRs down to - 12 dB in three different channels, which corresponds to an SNR per bit \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Eb</i>\n/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n=+ 5 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Underwater Telemetry With Adaptive Turbo Multiband Equalization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2009.2032997","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5308749/05299204.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2009.2032997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299204/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Underwater Telemetry With Adaptive Turbo Multiband Equalization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5299204/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10995445","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Underwater Telemetry With Adaptive Turbo Multiband Equalization","sourcePdf":"joe-pvanwalree-2032997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07082S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5308749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5308749","articleId":"5299204","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5299210,"authors":[{"name":"Esther Rodriguez-Villegas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5335874/5299210/5299210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Esther Rodr\u00edguez-Villegas (SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, in 2002.","In 1997, she received a professional research grant from the Spanish government and joined the Microelectronic National Centre (CNM), where she was for six years.

When examples of one class in a training data set vastly outnumber examples of the other class(es), traditional data mining algorithms tend to create suboptimal classification models. Several techniques have been used to alleviate the problem of class imbalance, including data sampling and boosting. In this paper, we present a new hybrid sampling/boosting algorithm, called RUSBoost, for learning from skewed training data. This algorithm provides a simpler and faster alternative to SMOTEBoost, which is another algorithm that combines boosting and data sampling. This paper evaluates the performances of RUSBoost and SMOTEBoost, as well as their individual components (random undersampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, and AdaBoost). We conduct experiments using 15 data sets from various application domains, four base learners, and four evaluation metrics. RUSBoost and SMOTEBoost both outperform the other procedures, and RUSBoost performs comparably to (and often better than) SMOTEBoost while being a simpler and faster technique. Given these experimental results, we highly recommend RUSBoost as an attractive alternative for improving the classification performance of learners built using imbalanced data.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2029559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2029559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5353819/05299216.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RUSBoost: A Hybrid Approach to Alleviating Class Imbalance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"RUSBoost: A Hybrid Approach to Alleviating Class Imbalance","volume":"40","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5299216/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020105","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299216/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RUSBoost: A Hybrid Approach to Alleviating Class Imbalance","sourcePdf":"tsmca-khoshgoftaar-2029559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098459S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5353819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"794","xplore-issue":"5353819","articleId":"5299216","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5299221,"authors":[{"name":"Eric B.

It is used for computing robust multivariate outlier diagnostics and for calculating robust covariance matrix estimates. Various search algorithms for finding or approximating the MVE have been developed, but due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, exact computation of the MVE is impractical for all but the smallest datasets. Since large datasets are increasingly common, alternative algorithms are desired. Even among small datasets, performance of the existing algorithms varies considerably-no single algorithm dominates in performance. This paper presents a unique matrix-structured genetic algorithm (GA) that directly searches the ellipsoid space for the MVE. By directly searching the space of ellipsoids, the impact of the combinatorial nature of the problem is minimized. The matrix-structured GA is described in detail, and evidence is provided to illustrate the performance of the new algorithm in detecting multivariate outliers.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2009.2023796","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5342537/05299221.pdf","startPage":"1247","endPage":"1260","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2009.2023796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matrix-Based Genetic Algorithm for Computing the Minimum Volume Ellipsoid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Matrix-Based Genetic Algorithm for Computing the Minimum Volume Ellipsoid","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10998925","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5299221/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix-Based Genetic Algorithm for Computing the Minimum Volume Ellipsoid","sourcePdf":"tevc-ehowington-2023796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085105S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5342537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5342537","articleId":"5299221","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5299223,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To achieve this energy saving without scarifying streaming quality, the base station must carefully construct the burst schedule for all TV channels. This is called the burst scheduling problem. In this paper, we prove that the burst scheduling problem for TV channels with arbitrary bit rates is NP-complete. We then propose a practical simplification of the general problem, which allows TV channels to be classified into multiple classes, and the bit rates of the classes have power of two increments, e.g., 100, 200, and 400 kbps. Using this practical simplification, we propose an optimal and efficient burst scheduling algorithm. We present theoretical analysis, simulation, and actual implementation in a mobile TV testbed to demonstrate the optimality, practicality, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2030326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446467","startPage":"610","endPage":"623","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5446467/05299246.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Burst Transmission Scheduling in Mobile TV Broadcast Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5299246/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Burst Transmission Scheduling in Mobile TV Broadcast Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228769","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Burst Transmission Scheduling in Mobile TV Broadcast Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-mhefeeda-2030326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076105S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5446467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5446467","articleId":"5299246","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299253,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-June Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Third Military, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-June","lastName":"Kim","id":"38666502300"},{"name":"Ho-Yun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ho-Yun","lastName":"Kim","id":"38107410200"},{"name":"Minjoong Rim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Minjoong","lastName":"Rim","id":"37302119800"},{"name":"Dae-Woon Lim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae-Woon","lastName":"Lim","id":"37533200700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5299253","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Delay estimation","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Digital video broadcasting","Receiving antennas","Delay effects","Interference","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","error statistics","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic delay diversity","optimal cyclic delay value","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","signal interference","noise ratio","diversity effect","channel estimation errors","frame error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic delay diversity (CDD)","cyclic delay value","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method to determine the optimal cyclic delay value of cyclic delay diversity (CDD) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

As the operators of PSO are originally designed in an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n-dimensional continuous space, the advancement of using PSO to find solutions in a discrete space is at a slow pace. In this paper, a novel set-based PSO (S-PSO) method for the solutions of some combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) in discrete space is presented. The proposed S-PSO features the following characteristics. First, it is based on using a set-based representation scheme that enables S-PSO to characterize the discrete search space of COPs. Second, the candidate solution and velocity are defined as a crisp set, and a set with possibilities, respectively. All arithmetic operators in the velocity and position updating rules used in the original PSO are replaced by the operators and procedures defined on crisp sets, and sets with possibilities in S-PSO. The S-PSO method can thus follow a similar structure to the original PSO for searching in a discrete space. Based on the proposed S-PSO method, most of the existing PSO variants, such as the global version PSO, the local version PSO with different topologies, and the comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO), can be extended to their corresponding discrete versions. These discrete PSO versions based on S-PSO are tested on two famous COPs: the traveling salesman problem and the multidimensional knapsack problem. Experimental results show that the discrete version of the CLPSO algorithm based on S-PSO is promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206071","htmlLink":"/document/5299261/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Set-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Method for Discrete Optimization Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Set-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Method for Discrete Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-jzhang-2030331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146924S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5438925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"268","xplore-issue":"5438925","articleId":"5299261","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299262,"authors":[{"name":"James Theiler","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Theiler","id":"37265688500"},{"name":"Clint Scovel","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Clint","lastName":"Scovel","id":"37857115700"},{"name":"Brendt Wohlberg","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Brendt","lastName":"Wohlberg","id":"37296019600"},{"name":"Bernard R.

While these steps add complexity to the design of WMPGs, they are shown to significantly increase harvested energy.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2031695","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5338501/05299263.pdf","startPage":"1288","endPage":"1299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2031695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Design Procedure for Wideband Micropower Generators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299263/","displayDocTitle":"A Design Procedure for Wideband Micropower Generators","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000108","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5299263/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design Procedure for Wideband Micropower Generators","sourcePdf":"jmems-abdelrahman-2031695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078535S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5338501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5338501","articleId":"5299263","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5299269,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Luc Starck","affiliation":["Laboratoire AIM (UMR 7158), CEA/DSM-CNRS-Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5466592/5299269/5299269-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jean-Luc Starck received the Ph.D. degree from University Nice-Sophia Antipolis, France, and the Habilitation degree from University Paris XI, France.","He was a Visitor with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in 1993; the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2004; and the Statistics Department, Stanford University, in 2000 and 2005.

With the recent advent of whole slide digital scanners, tissue histopathology slides can now be digitized and stored in digital image form. Consequently, digitized tissue histopathology has now become amenable to the application of computerized image analysis and machine learning techniques. Analogous to the role of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) algorithms in medical imaging to complement the opinion of a radiologist, CAD algorithms have begun to be developed for disease detection, diagnosis, and prognosis prediction to complement the opinion of the pathologist. In this paper, we review the recent state of the art CAD technology for digitized histopathology. This paper also briefly describes the development and application of novel image analysis technology for a few specific histopathology related problems being pursued in the United States and Europe.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2009.2034865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2009.2034865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/5338177/05299287.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histopathological Image Analysis: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Histopathological Image Analysis: A Review","volume":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5299287/","publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"11019114","pubMedId":"20671804","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299287/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Histopathological Image Analysis: A Review","sourcePdf":"rbme-mgurcan-2034865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.231458S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"5338177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"928","xplore-issue":"5338177","articleId":"5299287","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5299288,"authors":[{"name":"Wooyeol Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340253/5299288/5299288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wooyeol Choi (S'02) was born in Yongin, Korea, in 1979.

Due to multimetal layers, vertical interconnects, substrate loss and substrate-contact rings, the extrinsic parasitic network of CMOS field-effect transistor (FET) is more complicated than GaAs FETs and does not follow simple scaling rules. In this work, we have employed 3-D EM simulation to derive the scaling rules of the CMOS FETs. After de-embedding the effects of the pads and the interconnect lines using a pair of dummy patterns with different reference planes, the layout-dependent extrinsic network parameters are extracted using 3-D full-wave EM simulations. Based on the extracted parameters, new scaling rules are proposed for the extrinsic networks for 0.13 and 0.18 \u00bfm CMOS processes. A complete scalable RF CMOS model is constructed by combining the scalable extrinsic network with the intrinsic CMOS network, and has been validated by comparing the predicted and measured \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i>\n-parameters of the scaled devices from a family of 0.18 and 0.13 \u00bfm CMOS FETs up to 50 and 75 GHz, respectively.

The ELD problem has nonsmooth cost function with equality and inequality constraints which make it difficult to be effectively solved. Different heuristic optimization methods have been proposed to solve this problem in previous study. In this paper, quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is proposed, which has stronger search ability and quicker convergence speed, not only because of the introduction of quantum computing theory, but also due to two special implementations: self-adaptive probability selection and chaotic sequences mutation. The proposed approach is tested with five standard benchmark functions and three power system cases consisting of 3, 13, and 40 thermal units. Comparisons with similar approaches including the evolutionary programming (EP), genetic algorithm (GA), immune algorithm (IA), and other versions of particle swarm optimization (PSO) are given. The promising results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method and show that it could be used as a reliable tool for solving ELD problems.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5395745/05299292.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum-Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization for Valve-Point Economic Load Dispatch","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5299292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5299292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization for Valve-Point Economic Load Dispatch","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11087688","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5299292/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization for Valve-Point Economic Load Dispatch","sourcePdf":"25tpwrs01-kmeng-2030359.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152393S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5395745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"5395745","articleId":"5299292","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
