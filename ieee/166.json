Our method is based on the idea of regularization, whereby an optimization cost criterion to be minimized includes a penalty in accordance to how \"complex\" the system is. Specifically, our regularization term penalizes depending on how different an adapted system is from an unadapted system, thus avoiding the problem of overtraining when only a small amount of adaptation data is available. We justify this approach using a max-margin argument. We apply this technique to MLPs and produce a working real-time system for rapid adaptation of vowel classifiers in the context of the Vocal Joystick project. Overall, we find that our method outperforms all other MLP-based adaptation methods we are aware of. Our technique, however, is quite general and can be used whenever rapid adaptation of MLP or SVM classifiers are needed (e.g., from a speaker-independent to a speaker-dependent classifier in a hybrid MLP/HMM or SVM/HMM speech-recognition system)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34757/01660001.pdf","startPage":"I","endPage":"I","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized Adaptation of Discriminative Classifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Tellurium","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Automatic speech recognition","Training data","Parameter estimation","Multilayer perceptrons","Testing","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","speaker recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative classifiers","multilayer perceptrons","support vector machines","SVM","max-margin argument","speaker-independent classifier","speech-recognition system","Vocal Joystick"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Adaptation of Discriminative Classifiers","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1660001/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9130827","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Adaptation of Discriminative Classifiers","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056061S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"34757","articleId":"1660001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1660008,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Sha","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Fei Sha","id":"37281651700"},{"name":"L.K.

The required optimization is convex over the model's parameter space of positive semidefinite matrices and can be performed efficiently. Large margin GMMs are naturally suited to large problems in multiway classification; we apply them to phonetic classification and recognition on the TIMIT database.

The other approach proposes to remove a strong constraint in the original MRME algorithm, so that MRME algorithm can be applied to all training data as opposed to only correctly recognized data in the original MRME approach. Both new approaches can take advantage of more training data during the large margin training and can bootstrap directly from MLE models without a separate MCE training step.

On a set of three academic lectures on different subjects, we show that the clustering component of the algorithm is able to successfully generate word clusters that have good coverage of subject-relevant words. Moreover, we illustrate how to use the cluster nodes to retrieve the word identity of each cluster from a large baseform dictionary. Results indicate that this algorithm may prove useful for applications such as vocabulary initialization, speech summarization, or augmentation of existing recognition systems","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34757","startPage":"I","endPage":"I","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34757/01660044.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Word Acquisition from Speech using Pattern Discovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Vocabulary","Audio recording","Speech recognition","Automatic speech recognition","Streaming media","Glass","Computer science","Artificial intelligence","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern clustering","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised word acquisition","acoustic pattern discovery","automatic word discovery","graph clustering","baseform searching","speech recognition","clustering component","word cluster generation","subject-relevant words","baseform dictionary","vocabulary initialization","speech summarization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Word Acquisition from Speech using Pattern Discovery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660044/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1660044/","accessionNumber":"9130856","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Word Acquisition from Speech using Pattern Discovery","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06701S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"34757","articleId":"1660044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1660053,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The key point in template matching approaches is finding the most similar templates to the test utterance. Traditionally, this selection is given by a distortion measure on the acoustic features. In this work, we propose to improve this template selection with the use of meta-linguistic information as prior knowledge. In this way, similarity is not only based on acoustic features but also on other sources of information that are present in the speech signal. Results on a continuous digit recognition task confirm the statement that similarity between words does not only depend on acoustic features since we obtained 24% relative improvement over the baseline. Interestingly, results are better even when compared to a system with no prior information but a larger number of templates","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34757/01660053.pdf","startPage":"I","endPage":"I","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Pitch as Prior Knowledge in Template-Based Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Using Pitch as Prior Knowledge in Template-Based Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9130865","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660053/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Pitch as Prior Knowledge in Template-Based Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05599S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34757","articleId":"1660053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1660073,"authors":[{"name":"T.N.

We compare the performance of our approach under noisy conditions against two segmentation methods used in the SUMMIT segment-based speech recognizer, a full segmentation approach and an approach that detects segment boundaries based on spectral change. The word error rate of the spectral change segmentation method degrades rapidly in the presence of noise, while the sinusoidal and full segmentation models degrade more gracefully. However, the full segmentation method requires the largest computation time of the three approaches. We find that our new algorithm provides the best tradeoff between word accuracy and computation time of the three methods.

In the proposed approach, GMD starts from a single Gaussian and is built up by sequentially adding new components. Each new component is globally selected to produce optimal gain in the objective function. MLE and MMI are unified under the H-criterion, which is optimized by the extended BW (EBW) algorithm. A partial extended EM algorithm is developed for stage-wise optimization of new components.

The application of linear transformations not only to the input features, but also to the outputs of the internal layers is investigated. The motivation is that the outputs of an internal layer represent a projection of the input pattern into a space where it should be easier to learn the classification or transformation expected at the output of the network. A new solution, called conservative training, is proposed that compensates for the lack of adaptation samples in certain classes. Supervised adaptation experiments with different corpora and for different adaptation types are described. The results show that the proposed approach always outperforms the use of transformations in the feature space and yields even better results when combined with linear input transformations","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660239","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34757/01660239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34757","startPage":"I","endPage":"I","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptation of Hybrid ANN/HMM Models Using Linear Hidden Transformations and Conservative Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation of Hybrid ANN/HMM Models Using Linear Hidden Transformations and Conservative Training","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660239/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9142507","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660239/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation of Hybrid ANN/HMM Models Using Linear Hidden Transformations and Conservative Training","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055509S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"34757","articleId":"1660239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1660247,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

The DP-NUS formulation provides a useful control over the trade-off between bitrate and performance (reconstruction error).

The new model inherits the merits from the tensor rank one analysis, which handles the small samples size problem naturally, and the linear discriminant analysis, which is optimal for classification. Although 2 DLDA and DATR also benefit from these two methods, they cannot converge during the training procedure. This means they can be hardly utilized for practical applications.

For evaluation, 2156 images from 308 eyes are mapped into a rectangular format with 512 pixels circumferentially and 80 radially. For identity verification, the 48 rows nearest the pupil were taken and the images were subsampled by Fourier domain processing. Negligible degradation in verification is observed if at least 171 circumferential and 16 radial Fourier coefficients are preserved, corresponding to sampling at 342 by 32 pixels. With compression by JPEG 2000, improved performance is observed down to 0.3 bpp, attributed to noise reduction without significant loss of texture. To ensure that no algorithm is degraded, it is recommended that normalized iris images should be exchanged at 512 times 80 pixel resolution, compressed by JPEG 2000 to 0.5 bpp. This achieves a smaller file size than the proposed M1 biometric data interchange format","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660348","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34758/01660348.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"II","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Sampling and Compression on Human IRIS Verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Sampling and Compression on Human IRIS Verification","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660348/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9142598","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Sampling and Compression on Human IRIS Verification","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058643S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"34758","articleId":"1660348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1660349,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-Yang Lin","id":"37420979700"},{"name":"Kin-Chung Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Kin-Chung Wong","id":"38253839600"},{"name":"N.

However, these 3D approaches require the cooperation of the person to acquire accurate 3D data; thus, they are not appropriated for some applications such as video surveillance or restricted area access points where only a 2D face image is disposable. In this paper, a novel approach is presented which takes advantage of 3D data in the training stage but only requires 2D data in the recognition stage.

This paper proposes a joint source channel coding scheme able to resist transmission errors over mixed Internet-wireless channels. It involves motion-compensated oversampled filterbanks (OFBs). The redundancy introduced by the overcomplete representation in signals at the output of OFBs is employed for error correction of the motion compensated frames. The errors may be due to the wireless part of the channel (random noise), but also to the Internet part (packet losses). The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated for compressed streams transmitted through a packet erasure channel with an averaged packet loss of 6.25% followed by a binary symmetric channel with a crossover probability of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Internet","Video coding","Channel coding","Resists","Information filtering","Information filters","Redundancy","Error correction","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","combined source-channel coding","error correction","Internet","IP networks","motion compensation","random noise","signal representation","video coding","video streaming","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust video transmission","mixed IP-wireless channels","motion-compensated oversampled filterbanks","robust video coding","joint source channel coding scheme","transmission errors","mixed Internet-wireless channels","overcomplete signal representation","error correction","random noise","packet losses","compressed streams","packet erasure channel","binary symmetric channel","crossover probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660399","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34758/01660399.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"II","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Video Transmission Over Mixed IP - Wireless Channels using Motion-Compensated Oversampled Filterbanks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Video Transmission Over Mixed IP - Wireless Channels using Motion-Compensated Oversampled Filterbanks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660399/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1660399/","accessionNumber":"9142649","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Video Transmission Over Mixed IP - Wireless Channels using Motion-Compensated Oversampled Filterbanks","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051358S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34758","articleId":"1660399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1660412,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

Because the super-resolution problem is an ill-posed one, many regularized algorithms have been proposed. Those algorithms usually use the same regularization term for a whole image. However, since an image generally contains various regions of different characteristics, simple regularization is not good enough for the prospective result. In this paper, we propose a region-based super-resolution algorithm to apply a suitable regularization term for each region. In the algorithm, the image is divided into homogeneous and inhomogeneous regions. According to the type of region, we apply different filters for regularization. Regularization parameters are also adaptively determined during the iteration.

This algorithm firstly performs kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) on the original data to fully mine high-order correlation between spectral bands. Then, high-order statistics in local scene are exploited to define local average singularity (LAS), which is used to measure the singularity of each nonlinear principal component transformed. Based on LAS, one component transformed with maximum singularity is selected after KPCA. Finally, with RX detector, anomaly detection is performed on the component selected.

Horizontal, vertical and diagonal ratios of averages of nonoverlapped neighboring pixel values instead of gradients are used to calculate edge strength maps (ESM); then they are fused to obtain the final ESM; finally, a threshold is presented to obtain edge detection result.

In this paper, we propose an improved motion estimation method based on SSIM (MEBSS) for H.264 inter coding. Experiment results show that the MEBSS can reduce average 20% bit rate and 2% encoding time while maintaining the same perceptual video quality, and the maximum reduction in bitrate is more than 50%","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Motion Estimation Method Based on Structural Similarity for H.264 Inter Prediction","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660492","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34758/01660492.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"II","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Motion Estimation Method Based on Structural Similarity for H.264 Inter Prediction","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1660492/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9142725","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Motion Estimation Method Based on Structural Similarity for H.264 Inter Prediction","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660492.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067402S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"34758","articleId":"1660492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1660497,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Hao Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Guan-Hao Chen","id":"37291142500"},{"name":"Chun-Ling Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Chun-Ling Yang","id":"37291794300"},{"name":"Lai-Man Po","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Lai-Man Po","id":"37270836200"},{"name":"Sheng-Li Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Sheng-Li Xie","id":"37278013300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0469-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"1660497","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":644},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Distortion measurement","Quality assessment","PSNR","Pollution measurement","Image processing","Data mining","Humans","Visual system","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge-based structural similarity","image quality assessment","image processing","human visual system","PSNR","blurred images"]}],"abstract":"Objective quality assessment has been widely used in image processing for decades and many researchers have been studying the objective quality assessment method based on human visual system (HVS).

However, ST-NLMS still suffers from the inherent limitation of LMS. This necessitates a compromise between the opposing fundamental requirements of fast convergence rate and small misadjustment. Following the same block diagram as ST-NLMS, the stochastic step-size NLMS (SS-NLMS) scheme is proposed and integrated into the ST-NLMS framework. The combination leads to a novel algorithm called STS-NLMS, which adjusts step-size and active taps simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that substantial improvements in the speed of convergence are achieved by using the proposed algorithm in stationary environment outperforming both NLMS and ST-NLMS with the same small level of misadjustment. In addition, the proposed algorithm shows superior tracking capability when the system is subjected to an abrupt disturbance. Furthermore, if nonstationary environment is considered, the performance of the proposed algorithm is still satisfying","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34759","startPage":"III","endPage":"III","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34759/01660602.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Nlms Filters with Stochastic Active Taps and Step-Sizes for Sparse System Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Stochastic systems","System identification","Least squares approximation","Convergence","Stochastic processes","Echo cancellers","Iterative algorithms","Adaptive filters","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","least mean squares methods","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel NLMS filters","stochastic active taps","sparse system identification","abrupt disturbance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Nlms Filters with Stochastic Active Taps and Step-Sizes for Sparse System Identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660602/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1660602/","accessionNumber":"9142810","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Nlms Filters with Stochastic Active Taps and Step-Sizes for Sparse System Identification","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034369S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"34759","articleId":"1660602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1660608,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanning Yu","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Eng.

We specifically study the case of signal detection in strong inference and noise and propose an incoherent detection and estimation algorithm (IDEA) based on matching pursuit. The number of measurements and computations necessary for successful detection using IDEA is significantly lower than that necessary for successful reconstruction. Simulations show that IDEA is very resilient to strong interference, additive noise, and measurement quantization. When combined with random measurements, IDEA is applicable to a wide range of different signal classes","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Signal Detection from Incoherent Projections","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660651","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34759/01660651.pdf","startPage":"III","endPage":"III","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Signal Detection from Incoherent Projections","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1660651/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9142859","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Signal Detection from Incoherent Projections","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049538S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"34759","articleId":"1660651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1660652,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

In this paper, we propose a new architecture which exploits the structure shared by many redundant MP dictionaries, and thus decreases its complexity to O(N log N). This architecture is implemented in a new software toolkit, called MPTK (the Matching Pursuit Toolkit), which is able to reach, e.g., 0.25\u00d7real time for a typical MP analysis scenario applied to a 1 hour long audio track. This substantial acceleration makes it possible, from now on, to explore and apply MP in the framework of real-life, high-dimensional data processing problems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660699","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34759/01660699.pdf","startPage":"III","endPage":"III","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mptk: Matching Pursuit Made Tractable","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Mptk: Matching Pursuit Made Tractable","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660699/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660699/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mptk: Matching Pursuit Made Tractable","confLoc":"Toulouse","sourcePdf":"01660699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066789S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"34759","articleId":"1660699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1660704,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Because canonical correlations make up a complete, or maximal, set of invariants for the Hermitian and complementary covariance matrices under linear transformations, the GLR can be shown to be a function of the squared canonical correlations between the data and its complex conjugate.

The method is designed for sparse and compressible signals, i.e., ones that are well approximated by a short linear combination of vectors from an orthonormal basis. Signal reconstruction involves a nonlinear orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that we implement efficiently by exploiting the nonadaptive, time-invariant structure of the measurement process. While simpler and more efficient than other random acquisition techniques like compressed sensing, random filtering is sufficiently generic to summarize many types of compressible signals and generalizes to streaming and continuous-time signals.

The supply voltage of the digital baseband is lowered so that the correlator operates near its minimum energy point resulting in a 68% energy reduction across the entire baseband. This optimum supply voltage occurs below the threshold voltage, placing the circuit in the sub-threshold region. The correlator and the rest of the baseband must be parallelized to maintain throughput at this reduced voltage. While sub-threshold operation is traditionally used for low energy, low frequency applications such as wrist-watches, this paper examines how sub-threshold operation can be applied to low energy, high performance applications. The correlators are further parallelized for a 31x reduction in the synchronization time, which along with duty-cycling, lowers the energy per packet by 43% for a 500 byte packet.

One is to employ matrix factorization through revealing the intrinsic relationship among several existing famous algorithms, which is regarded as an effective guide for exploring new algorithms. The other is to make use of the orthogonal property of the DCT matrix. As long as the recursive kernel of an algorithm is orthogonal, there must be a twin fast DCT algorithm of it. Matrix factorization is applied through the research and can be used to show how data flows and compute the computational complexity easily. At the end of this paper, we also present a new fast algorithm for DCT.

This paper presents a genetic algorithm for the design and optimization of frequency-response masking (FRM) FIR digital filters over the CSD multiplier coefficient space. This is based on designing a corresponding infinite-precision-coefficient digital filter seed (through a conventional continuous optimization), and on quantizing the resulting multiplier coefficients into CSD coefficients via a look-up table. The resulting digital filter is subsequently encoded into a chromosome which is perturbed to form an initial population for the genetic algorithm. The salient feature of the resulting genetic algorithm is that it automatically leads to legitimate CSD-coefficient offspring digital filters after the operations of crossover and mutation, i.e. without any recourse to gene repair.

In this technique, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) are kernel processing blocks in an OFDM system, and are used for data (de)modulation. OFDM systems are increasingly required to be flexible to accommodate different standards and operation modes, in addition to being energy-efficient. A trade-off between these two conflicting requirements can be achieved by employing application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs). In this paper, two ASIP design concepts for the cached FFT algorithm (CFFT) are presented. A reduction in energy dissipation of up to 25% is achieved compared to an ASIP for the widely used Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, which was designed by using the same design methodology and technology. Further, a modified CFFT algorithm which enables a better cache utilization is presented.

In all, the required number of shift-and-add operations for micro-rotations and scale-factor compensations is only n/2, where n is the output precision. For design verification, we synthesized both serial and pipelined architectures, by using synopsys design compiler based on UMC 0.18 mum, 1P6M CMOS technology. The synthesized 16-bit pipelined FFT PE runs at 222 MHz, with a total gate count of 89263 and a low-power consumption of 26.75 mW.

Assuming that the transmitter knows the SNR of all the receivers, opportunistic strategy maximizes the throughput (sum-rate) of the system. It is usually assumed that CSI is accurate, however, evaluating the SNR is basically an estimation problem in the receiver which cannot be done without error. In this paper, we analyze the effect of the noisy estimation of SNR on the throughput of a broadcast channel. We propose a generalization of the opportunistic transmission in which the transmitter still sends to the user with the highest estimated SNR, but backs off on the transmit rate based on the variance of the estimation error. We obtain the optimum amount of back off and compute the throughput for our scheduling scheme. Clearly, the estimation can be improved by using a longer training phase; however, longer training would deteriorate the throughput. In the final part of the paper, we address this trade off and obtain the optimum training strategy that maximizes the throughput of the system","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660897","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660897.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660897","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Channel Estimation Error on the Throughput of Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Channel Estimation Error on the Throughput of Broadcast Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660897/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1660897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9143034","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Channel Estimation Error on the Throughput of Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035612S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1660898,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The relay is assumed to be nonregenerative (or amplify-and-forward (AF)). We assume channel state information at each transmitter (CSIT), source and relay. We present a jointly optimized power allocation (PA) over the subchannels in space and frequency domain at source and relay with a joint transmit power constraint. The PA is based on a high SNR approximation of the SNR expression at the destination. In the low SNR regime, the performance is still very tight to the optimal rate. The presented PA can be computed with low computational complexity and achieves a considerable performance gain compared to a uniform PA at source and relay. To further enhance the performance of the considered scheme, all subchannels, in space and frequency domain, of the source to relay and relay to destination channel are paired according to their actual magnitude","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660902.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power Allocation for Nonregenerative MIMO-OFDM Relay Links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Constraint optimization","Frequency domain analysis","Power system relaying","Computational complexity","MIMO","Throughput","Power system modeling","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","radio links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint power allocation","nonregenerative MIMO-OFDM relay links","multiple input multiple output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel state information","joint transmit power constraint","SNR approximation","signal-to-noise ratio","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power Allocation for Nonregenerative MIMO-OFDM Relay Links","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1660902/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9143039","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power Allocation for Nonregenerative MIMO-OFDM Relay Links","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061326S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1660904,"authors":[{"name":"Xingkai Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Xingkai Bao","id":"37553423300"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, US"],"lastName":"Jing Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0469-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"1660904","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":135},"abstract":"Adaptive-network-coded-cooperation (ANCC) is an efficient user cooperation scheme proposed for large wireless networks comprising a host of terminals communicating with a common destination. By matching code graphs with instantaneous network graphs in a distributed and adaptive manner, the protocol enables network coding to be exploited in networks with unreliable channels and changing topologies. This paper analyzes the outage behavior of ANCC when the number of terminals trends to infinity. A threshold phenomenon is revealed which demonstrates that an arbitrarily small outage can be achieved with a sufficiently large network as long as the channel conditions are above a certain threshold. Comparison with the existing cooperation schemes shows that ANCC achieves a substantial gain of 30 dB over repetition, and falls only 1 dB short of space-time-coded-cooperation (but obviating the need for stringent inter-user synchronization)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660904.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Outage Properties of Adaptive Network Coded Cooperation (ANCC) in Large Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Intelligent networks","Wireless networks","Network coding","Relays","Network topology","Bandwidth","Protocols","H infinity control","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage properties","adaptive network coded cooperation","ANCC","large wireless networks","user cooperation scheme","code graphs","instantaneous network graphs","protocol","network coding","space-time-coded-cooperation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["User cooperation","outage","network coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"On the Outage Properties of Adaptive Network Coded Cooperation (ANCC) in Large Wireless Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1660904/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9143041","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Outage Properties of Adaptive Network Coded Cooperation (ANCC) in Large Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055626S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1660908,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed scheme minimizes amplitude variation of the outphase signals, which reduces the gain requirement of the power amplifiers that can be traded for higher efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that outphase amplifying can be twice as efficient as the conventional class-A power amplifiers, and is suitable for wireless systems with large peak-to-average ratios.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660914","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660914.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital Amplitude-to-phase Conversion for High Efficiency Linear Outphase Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Digital Amplitude-to-phase Conversion for High Efficiency Linear Outphase Power Amplifiers","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660914/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9209379","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660914/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digital Amplitude-to-phase Conversion for High Efficiency Linear Outphase Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039898S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1660916,"authors":[{"name":"D.

However in wireless systems, performance and mobility can be further enhanced by operating semi-blind channel estimation refinement between reference symbols. A channel tracking method based on a MAP version of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and on a block representation of channel variations has been proposed. It performs better than already existing recursive algorithms but have a quadratic complexity. In this paper, we propose a simplified MAP algorithm which has a linear complexity and we examine its convergence properties. This simplification is an adaptation of the one step late technique to the EM algorithm for MAP estimation. The proposed algorithm is applicable to both single carrier and OFDM systems.

Specifically, the blind estimation is formulated as a support vector regression (SVR) problem in which the channel coefficients are the Lagrange multipliers of the dual problem. In this paper, we show that the SRM principle pushes to zero the small leading and trailing terms of the channel impulse response even when its order is highly overestimated. The main drawback of this approach is the high computational cost of the resulting quadratic programming (QP) problem.

Simulations show that the new algorithm significantly outperforms existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660937","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660937.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","startPage":"189","endPage":"192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Noncoherent Lattice Decoding of QAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Noncoherent Lattice Decoding of QAM","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660937/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9209402","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660937/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Likelihood Noncoherent Lattice Decoding of QAM","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077733S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1660941,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Sun","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yong Sun","id":"37087363818"},{"name":"Jin Li","affiliation":["Communication and Collaboration Systems, Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Jin Li","id":"37087268794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0469-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"1660941","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Context modeling","Sun","Distributed computing","Collaboration","Bit rate","Audio coding","Performance gain","Peer to peer computing","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","combined source-channel coding","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed source coding","context modeling","coding bitrate","turbo-based channel code","LDPC","random flipper","binary asymmetric channel","audio coding system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660941","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660941.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Source Coding With Context Modeling","abstract":"We introduce context modeling into the distributed source coding (DSC). By forming contexts from prior coded bitplanes of both the reference and DSC coded peer, we split the virtual channel between the two correlated bitplanes into several virtual sub-channels of different characteristics. The selection of the subchannel becomes side information that is known to the receiver. As a result, the DSC coding bitrate is reduced. We also investigate a number of practical implementation issues in DSC; e.g., the use of turbo-based channel code vs. the LDPC-based channel code, and the use of a random flipper to handle the binary asymmetric channel. We implemented a practical DSC audio coding system. We show that DSC without context modeling shows little performance gain compared with separate source coding with context modeling. In comparison, context DSC achieves an overall rate saving of 36%, even as we only applied DSC on a selected number of bitplanes, and considering the channel code loss in practical implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660941/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9209406","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Source Coding With Context Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Source Coding With Context Modeling","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0405S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1660946,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Many methods have been proposed to reduce the OFDM PAPR for single-antenna and for MIMO systems. Some systems, however, use multiple antennas for frequency-selective transmit beamforming either to a single or multiple simultaneous receivers. This paper presents a new method for PAPR reduction that minimizes the peak power across all antennas while preserving the maximal ratio transmission (MRT) gain and zero-crosstalk criteria at the receivers. Because the gain and zero crosstalk is preserved at the receivers, no performance loss is seen by the receivers when using the PAPR-reduced transmit vector. With eight transmit antennas, the algorithm demonstrates an average of 5.5 dB PAPR reduction for single-user beamforming and about 4.5 dB PAPR reduction for four-user transmit spatial division multiple access (Tx-SDMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660962.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Papr Reduction for Beamforming Ofdm Transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Array signal processing","OFDM","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Frequency division multiplexing","MIMO","Performance gain","Crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space division multiple access","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming OFDM transmitters","PAPR reduction","peak-to-average-power ratio","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","maximal ratio transmission","zero-crosstalk criteria","receivers","transmit antennas","single-user beamforming","four-user transmit spatial division multiple access","SDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Papr Reduction for Beamforming Ofdm Transmitters","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1660962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9209427","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Papr Reduction for Beamforming Ofdm Transmitters","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036138S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1660963,"authors":[{"name":"G.T.

However, RF transmitters must be operated in their linear region and highly stable oscillators (low phase-noise) are a necessity or the BER will degrade significantly. If angle-modulation is instead used, then the RF signal has constant envelope and phase-noise has an additive effect, the result being more efficient power transmission and orthogonality is maintained with a noisy oscillator. Angle-modulation has lower spectral efficiency then QAM and angle-demodulators suffer a threshold effect: the receiver output SNR degrades, significantly once below a certain input SNR. To apply angle-modulated OFDM systems in practice this threshold effect and ifs impact on the BER (for a given spectral efficiency) must be analyzed.

OFDM is considered to be a very bandwidth efficient wireless transmission technique (due to its tightly packed orthogonal subcarrier structure) for multi-path channels. Transmissions in multi-path channels exhibiting long delay spread channels, however, require an excessively long cyclic prefix (CP) to prevent intersymbol interference (ISI) with OFDM, and thus undesirably reduce the bandwidth and power efficiency of the information transmission. Channel shortening equalization (CSE) is used to shorten the channel delay spread to a certain length (less than the CP length) so that ISI is minimized. Our technique adapts to channel variation and provides a significant bit error rate (BER) improvement in performance over non-adaptive techniques. We show that the adaptive technique improves the demodulated BER by greater than a factor of 10, with diversity order 1, in a mobile long delay spread (frequency-selective) channel, while the non-adaptive method exhibits a BER floor at 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660980","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660980.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Channel Shortening Equalization For Coherent OFDM Doubly Selective Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1660980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660980/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Channel Shortening Equalization For Coherent OFDM Doubly Selective Channels","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154337","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1660980/","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Channel Shortening Equalization For Coherent OFDM Doubly Selective Channels","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05978S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1660981,"authors":[{"name":"Daofeng Xu","affiliation":["Radio Engineering Department, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Daofeng Xu","id":"37291413800"},{"name":"Luxi Yang","affiliation":["Radio Engineering Department, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Luxi Yang","id":"37292054200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0469-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"1660981","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","OFDM modulation","Block codes","Channel estimation","Channel state information","State estimation","Virtual colonoscopy","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","matrix algebra","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace-based blind channel estimation","STBC-OFDM","space-time coded OFDM system","space-time block coding","channel state information","Alamouti STBC","single receiving antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["space-time coding","blind channel estimation","OFDM","subspace"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a subspace-based blind channel estimation method for space-time coded OFDM system.

The proposed equalizer is not limited to systems using the IFFT/FFT pair (like in DMT or OFDM), but to any multicarrier system that can be modelled as a pair of perfect reconstruction filter banks. As the computational complexity of the equalizer can be high, an efficient implementation based on the Cholesky factorization is developed. Compared to the traditional zero-forcing approach, experiments show that in the presence of interblock interference (IBI), the proposed equalizer performs significantly better, regardless of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the absence of IBI (i.e. when the guard interval is sufficiently long), improvements have also been observed at low SNR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Filter bank","OFDM modulation","Computational complexity","Interference","DSL","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Consumer products","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","computational complexity","equalisers","fast Fourier transforms","interference (signal)","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE equalization","zero padded multicarrier systems","IFFT","reconstruction filter banks","computational complexity","Cholesky factorization","interblock interference","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660984","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01660984.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE Equalization for Zero Padded Multicarrier Systems with Insufficient Guard Length","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MMSE Equalization for Zero Padded Multicarrier Systems with Insufficient Guard Length","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9154341","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1660984/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1660984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE Equalization for Zero Padded Multicarrier Systems with Insufficient Guard Length","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01660984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045207S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1660984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1660985,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xi Chen","id":"37694168600"},{"name":"A.R.

The estimator is based on the computation of a suitable phase distribution that we call \"signature\". The signature is defined as the phase-dependent distribution of the received signal magnitude after the application of a nonlinear transformation. The signature of a QAM signal is constituted by a discrete number of pulses and it has good autocorrelation properties in the sense of maximum/side-lobe ratio. Since the effect of a phase offset is a cyclic shift of the signature, the phase offset can be estimated by searching for the maximum of the cyclic cross-correlation between the zero-phase signature of the expected constellation, and the signature calculated on the received signal. The resulting estimator is characterized by a low computational complexity and does not need gain control.

Key information needed in such techniques is the multipath delays of the channel. Prior approaches to estimation of multipath delays require regular pilot structures and may not work in slow fading. We propose a group matching pursuit technique for channel estimation. The technique is an extension of the orthogonal matching pursuit technique. It employs the pilots in several OFDM symbols to estimate the multipath delays in a sequential manner, where the pilots can have an arbitrary structure.

By relying on such a multislot invariance of angles and delays and by periodically extending a training sequence over multiple time-slots, we show that the received signal can be modeled as a third-order (3D) tensor, which follows a parallel factor (PARAFAC) model. An accelerated alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm is used for a joint estimation of the angles of arrival, delays and fading amplitudes of the multipaths.

The channel matrix is assumed deterministic (no stochastic model assumed) and unknown at both the receiver and the transmitter. In contrast with other approaches, the Gaussian observation noise has an arbitrary correlation structure, known by the transmitter and the receiver. To handle the unknown deterministic space-time channel, a GLRT receiver is implemented. We propose a new methodology for space-time codebook design under this non-coherent setup. This optimizes the probability of error of the receiver's detector in the high SNR regime, thus solving a high-dimensional nonlinear non-smooth optimization problem in a two-step approach: (i) firstly, a convex SDP relaxation yields a rough estimate of the optimal codebook; (ii) this is then refined through a geodesic descent optimization algorithm that exploits the Riemannian geometry imposed by the power constraints on the space-time codewords. Computer simulations demonstrate that, for the specific case of spatio-temporal white observation noise, our codebooks are marginally better than those provided by state-of-art known solutions.

To avoid the inherent ambiguities of this problem, the spatial correlation matrix of the source signals must be non-white and known at the receiver. In practice, this can be achieved by a number of simple linear precoding techniques at the transmitter side. More specifically, it is shown in the paper that if the source correlation matrix has different eigenvalues, then the decoding process can be formulated as the problem of maximizing the sum of a set of weighted variances of the signal estimates. Exploiting the special structure of OSTBCs, this problem can be reduced to a principal component analysis (PCA) problem, which allows us to derive computationally efficient batch and adaptive blind decoding algorithms.

On the other hand, it has recently been shown that, over a wide range of dimensions and SNR, the sphere decoder can be used to find the exact solution with an expected complexity that is roughly cubic in the dimension of the problem. However, the computational complexity becomes prohibitive if the SNR is too low and/or if the dimension of the problem is too large. In earlier work, we targeted these two regimes attempting to find faster algorithms by pruning the search tree beyond what is done in the standard sphere decoder. The search tree is pruned by computing lower bounds on the possible optimal solution as we proceed to go down the tree. A trade-off between the computational complexity required to compute the lower bound and the size of the pruned tree is readily observed: the more effort we spend in computing a tight lower bound, the more branches that can be eliminated in the tree. Thus, even though it is possible to prune the search tree (and hence the number of points visited) by several orders of magnitude, this may be offset by the computations required to perform the pruning. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient lower bound which requires solving a single semi-definite program (SDP) at the top of the search tree; the solution to the SDP is then used to deduce the lower bounds on the optimal solution on all levels of the search tree.

The corresponding channel estimation error, the Chernoff's upper bound on the detection error probability, and a lower bound on channel capacity of such systems are analyzed. Based on such analysis, the relationship between these two bounds are revealed, then a unified optimum power allocation scheme is proposed based on jointly optimizing both bounds subject to an acceptable channel estimation error. Simulation results indicate that the proposed power allocation scheme yields a better performance in terms of the error probability, whereas the equal power allocation scheme can be reasonably used as a suboptimum approach with an acceptable performance degradation. Furthermore, the unequal power allocation with more power constantly allocated to the data part yields a much better performance than the one with more power constantly allocated to the pilot part","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01661033.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Power Allocation for Maximum-Likelihood Channel Estimation in Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Channel estimation","MIMO","Error probability","Upper bound","Channel capacity","Maximum likelihood detection","Power system modeling","Power engineering computing","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","channel estimation","error statistics","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO systems","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum power allocation","maximum-likelihood channel estimation","space-time code","MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","data-bearing approach","pilot-embedding","detection error probability","channel capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Power Allocation for Maximum-Likelihood Channel Estimation in Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1661033/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154390","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Power Allocation for Maximum-Likelihood Channel Estimation in Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037629S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1661033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1661038,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This paper addresses the problem of optimising the channel estimate for a wideband DS-CDMA rake receiver. A simplified adaptive least squares scheme is proposed as a channel estimator, with only one adjustable parameter, the averaging window size. Then, the mean squared error of the channel estimate is analytically extracted. The estimation error is found to consist of two antagonistic (with respect to the window size) components: a) the estimation noise (due to the transmission channel noise, inter-chip interference and multiple-access interference), and b) the estimation distortion (due to the limited ability of the adaptive algorithm to track the non-stationary channel).

The main benefit of the algorithm is its independency of near-far ratio which arises from the fact that MUI is deterministically eliminated before estimating the channel parameters. Also, the proposed scheme doesn't need to estimate any statistic (such as a correlation matrix) for parameter estimation.

In this paper, we present a Multi-step Adaptive Sensor Scheduling algorithm (MASS) by selecting the next tasking sensor and its associated sampling interval based on the prediction of tracking accuracy and energy cost over a finite horizon of steps. MASS adopts alternative tracking mode for each prediction step, i.e., the fast tracking mode (FTM) or the tracking maintenance mode (TMM) dependent on whether the estimated or predicted tracking accuracy is satisfactory. The Best Sensor Schedule Sequence (BSSS) is found by searching and comparing the Candidate Sensor Schedule Sequences (CSSSs) at two levels, i.e., the logical tracking mode level which is simplely defined on multi-step tracking modes and the physical quantity performance level by considering the tradeoff between tracking accuracy and energy cost. MASS employs the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm to predict the tracking accuracy and an energy consumption model to predict the energy cost. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional non-adaptive sensor scheduling algorithm and the single-step adaptive sensor scheduling algorithm, MASS can achieve fast tracking speed and superior energy efficiency without degrading the tracking accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Adaptive scheduling","Target tracking","Scheduling algorithm","Accuracy","Costs","Collaboration","Sampling methods","Prediction algorithms","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive scheduling","Kalman filters","matrix algebra","nonlinear filters","target tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistep adaptive sensor scheduling","target tracking","wireless sensor networks","fast tracking mode","tracking maintenance mode","best sensor schedule sequence","candidate sensor schedule sequences","extended Kalman filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661066","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01661066.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Step Adaptive Sensor Scheduling for Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Step Adaptive Sensor Scheduling for Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661066/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1661066/","accessionNumber":"9154423","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Step Adaptive Sensor Scheduling for Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045376S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1661066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1661070,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Mouhouche et al. (2005). We compare the performance of two open-loop TD techniques for W-CDMA: The space time transmit diversity (STTD) and the orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD). We use the output SENR provided by a RAKE receiver when combined with each of these diversity techniques. It is impossible to obtain useful conclusions about the performance of the two techniques because the SENR depend in a complex way on many parameters like the spreading codes, the channel, etc. In order to obtain positive results, we follow the classical approach used for the first time in D.N.C. Tse and S. Hanly (1999) and assume that the spreading codes are random following a certain distribution. In this case, the SINRs can be interpreted as random variables. We consider the limit of the these SENRs when the spreading factor N and the number of users K tend to oo with fixed ratio. Under these conditions, the output SENRs can be shown to converge to deterministic limits independent of the \"random\" spreading codes. We interpret the output SENRs and discuss the different parameters influencing the performance of the two techniques","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661072","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01661072.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-System Comparison of Space-Time Transmit Diversity and Orthogonal Transmit Diversity for Downlink W-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661072/","displayDocTitle":"Large-System Comparison of Space-Time Transmit Diversity and Orthogonal Transmit Diversity for Downlink W-CDMA","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154429","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1661072/","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-System Comparison of Space-Time Transmit Diversity and Orthogonal Transmit Diversity for Downlink W-CDMA","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04488S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1661072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1661074,"authors":[{"name":"S.F.A.

In doing so, OFDM systems fail to reap the benefits of diversity available in multipath fading channels. To ameliorate this shortcoming of OFDM, explicit diversity in the form of redundant or non-redundant coding is needed. Our main goal in this paper is to explore different options for low complexity encoder design and compare their performance and complexity. Specifically, in the class of non-redundant codes we discuss the use of signal space diversity codes in OFDM systems. For redundant codes, we introduce a novel low complexity postcoded-OFDM system where coding is employed after performing the IFFT (inverse fast Fourier transform) in the transmitter to reduce system complexity. Simulation results show that postcoded-OFDM with redundant coding outperforms other choices of encoder design considered in this paper","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01661074.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Redundant and Redundant Post Coding in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Fast Fourier transforms","Transmitters","Hamming distance","Error analysis","OFDM modulation","Hafnium","Frequency division multiplexing","Resilience","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","diversity reception","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonredundant coding","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency selective fading channels","flat fading channels","multipath fading channels","explicit diversity","inverse fast Fourier transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Non-Redundant and Redundant Post Coding in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1661074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154431","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Redundant and Redundant Post Coding in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049381S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1661074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1661075,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

However, most existing works only deal with white input signal. When the input signal is colored, prewhitening and its inverse operation are often applied prior to precoding and after decoding, respectively. Consequently, the precoder and decoder are no longer optimal with respect to the original colored signal. In this paper, we propose a closed-form solution for optimal linear precoder and decoder for colored input signal.

Our algorithm is applicable to both single-antenna and multi-antenna receivers and can be combined with nonlinear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP).

The goal is achieved by combining information from sensors of different types and resolutions. Image processing techniques are employed to extract global information. This information is passed on to the local sensors to optimize the number and locations of low-level sampling points. The sampled values are then applied back to the image to reconstruct the whole field. The technique is tested in the lab setup and shown to achieve a better result than traditional sampling methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sampling","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Image reconstruction","Sampling methods","Temperature measurement","Cameras","Image processing","Data mining","Testing","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental science computing","image reconstruction","image resolution","image sampling","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental sampling","multiscale sensing","environment reconstruction","exhaustive sampling performance","image processing techniques"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661108","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01661108.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Environmental Samplingwith Multiscale Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Environmental Samplingwith Multiscale Sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661108/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1661108/","accessionNumber":"9154465","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environmental Samplingwith Multiscale Sensing","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049549S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1661108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1661110,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We first clarify geometrically an inherent difference in convergence speed between two adaptive algorithms, projected-NLMS (PNLMS) and constrained-NLMS (CNLMS), both of which are widely used for linearly constrained adaptive filtering problems. A simple geometric interpretation suggests that CNLMS converges faster than PNLMS especially in the challenging situations of the adaptive beamforming where there exist spatially-correlated interferences (i.e., interferences that have small angular separation with the desired signal). To enhance the advantage of CNLMS in convergence speed while keeping linear computational complexity, we then propose an efficient adaptive beamformer that utilizes multiple data at each iteration by extending the constrained parallel projection algorithm to complex cases. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamformer exhibits even faster convergence than the constrained affine projection algorithm (CAPA) as well as CNLMS","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661142","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01661142.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661142","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming by Constrained Parallel Projection in the Presence of Spatially-Correlated Interferences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming by Constrained Parallel Projection in the Presence of Spatially-Correlated Interferences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661142/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1661142/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154499","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Beamforming by Constrained Parallel Projection in the Presence of Spatially-Correlated Interferences","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060415S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1661142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1661143,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In dealing with the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation error, the dominant error source in the mobile positioning, most previous research in this area has focused on the NLOS identification and mitigation. In this paper, we investigate new positioning algorithms to take advantage of the NLOS propagation paths rather than cancelling them. Based on the prior information about the NLOS path, a least squares based position estimation algorithm is developed and its performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) is also analyzed. Furthermore, the maximum likelihood based algorithm is presented to jointly estimate the mobile's and scatterers' positions. The Cramer-Rao lower bound on the RMSE is derived for the benchmark of the performance comparison.

Most of the available receivers are very specific of the CDMA context and only some scarce receivers may also be used in other contexts such as F/TDMA systems. However, these receivers assume implicitly or explicitly circular interferences and become sub-optimal for non circular (or improper) interferences, characteristic in particular of radiocommunications networks using rectilinear (or monodimensional) modulations such as BPSK modulation. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to introduce and to analyse the performance of the optimal array receiver for synchronization of BPSK signals corrupted by non circular interferences. This receiver implements an optimal, in a least square sense, widely linear filtering of the data, mainly considered up to now for demodulation purposes of BPSK signals, followed by a correlation operation.

Consistency of the algorithm holds in situations where the signal and noise subspaces are asymptotically separable in the sense that, in the asymptotic sample eigenvalue distribution, signal and noise eigenvalues generate different spectral clusters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Signal processing algorithms","Covariance matrix","Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","Clustering algorithms","Noise generators","Signal processing","Telecommunications","Irrigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved subspace-based algorithm","small sample size regime","subspace identification","array signal processing","random matrix theory","noise subspaces","asymptotic sample eigenvalue distribution","spectral clusters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661158","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34760/01661158.pdf","startPage":"IV","endPage":"IV","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Subspace-Based Algorithm in the Small Sample Size Regime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Subspace-Based Algorithm in the Small Sample Size Regime","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661158/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1661158/","accessionNumber":"9154515","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Subspace-Based Algorithm in the Small Sample Size Regime","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052927S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"34760","articleId":"1661158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661166,"authors":[{"name":"Y.I.

Subspace based methods, e.g., the MUSIC algorithm, have been widely studied, however, they are only applicable when M > N. Another conventional independent component analysis based method allows M ges N, however, it cannot be applied when M < N. By contrast, our new method can be applied where the sources outnumber the sensors (i.e., an underdetermined case M < N) by assuming source sparseness. Our method can cope with 2- or 3-dimensionally distributed sources with a 2- or 3-dimensional sensor array.

This is based on a sub-band processing system, where, in each subband, the signal is modeled as an amplitude modulated sum of sinusoids.

To achieve model compactness and discriminability, we simultaneously perform feature dimension reduction and HMM parameter estimation via maximizing the confidence of accepting the hypothesis that observations are from target HMM states rather than competing HMM states. A new discriminative training criterion is derived using hypothesis test theory. Particularly, we develop the maximum confidence hidden Markov modeling (MCHMM) framework for face recognition. Using this framework, we incorporate a transformation matrix to extract discriminative facial features. The continuous-density HMM parameters are estimated using the extracted features. Importantly, we adopt a consistent criterion to build whole framework including feature extraction and model estimation. From the experiments on ORL facial databases, we find that the proposed method obtains robust image segmentation performance in presence of different variations of facial expressions, orientations, etc. In comparison of previous HMM approaches, the proposed MCHMM achieves better recognition accuracies and image segmentation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34761/01661334.pdf","startPage":"V","endPage":"V","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Confidence Hidden Markov Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Parameter estimation","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Pattern classification","Testing","Face recognition","Facial features","Image databases","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","image classification","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum confidence hidden Markov modeling","pattern classification","HMM parameter estimation","discriminative training criterion","hypothesis test theory","face recognition","feature extraction","image segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Confidence Hidden Markov Modeling","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1661334/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154646","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Confidence Hidden Markov Modeling","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054718S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34761","articleId":"1661334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1661335,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhou","affiliation":["Pixelworks, Inc., ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jian Zhou","id":"37291308200"},{"name":"Xiao-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"lastName":"Xiao-Ping Zhang","id":"37279339900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0469-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"1661335","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"abstract":"This paper describes a novel method for the analysis of sequential data that exhibits strong non-Gaussianities.

The proposed model can be efficiently applied for modeling images, image sequences, 3-D object models and higher dimensional applications, due to the composite structure of Markov chains which reduces the complexity while retaining good properties for multi-dimensional data. In case of 2-D lattices, the proposed model performs an elastic matching in both horizontal and vertical directions; this makes it possible to model not only invariances to the size and location of an object but also nonlinear warping in each dimension. We present a training algorithm for separable lattice HMMs based on a variational approximation. Moreover, the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was applied to the variational algorithm for separable lattice HMMs. Face recognition experiments on the XM2VTS database show that the proposed model has good properties for face image modeling.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661381","startPage":"V","endPage":"V","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34761/01661381.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Separable Lattice HMMS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Lattices","Hidden Markov models","Image sequences","Maximum likelihood estimation","Approximation algorithms","Computational complexity","Computer science","Educational institutions","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","face recognition","hidden Markov models","image matching","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","separable lattice HMM","hidden Markov models","hidden state sequences","image sequences","3D object models","elastic matching","nonlinear warping","deterministic annealing EM algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Separable Lattice HMMS","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1661381/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","accessionNumber":"9162801","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Based on Separable Lattice HMMS","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064842S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"34761","articleId":"1661381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1661382,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we develop, from the on-line processing (OP) algorithm derived using the nonstationarity and nonwhiteness properties, a normalized algorithm in which the update of the demixing matrix is based on the minimal disturbance principle. We show that the resulting updates are in the same direction as those of the original algorithm but with a scaling factor whose upper bound is unity. We evaluate the convergence speed and robustness to gradient noise of the new algorithm","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Signal Separation Using a Criterion Based on Principle of Minimal Disturbance","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661404","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34761/01661404.pdf","startPage":"V","endPage":"V","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind Signal Separation Using a Criterion Based on Principle of Minimal Disturbance","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1661404/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154662","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Signal Separation Using a Criterion Based on Principle of Minimal Disturbance","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066456S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","xplore-issue":"34761","articleId":"1661404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1661406,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We investigate some parameters of VQ encoding, including a more perceptually-motivated distance measure, and an encoding of phase derivatives that supports reconstruction directly from quantizer output alone. For the problem of separating speech from noise, we highlight some problems with this approach, including the need for sequential constraints (which we introduce with a simple hidden Markov model), and choices for choosing the best quantization for over-lapping sources","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661436","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34761/01661436.pdf","startPage":"V","endPage":"V","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Monaural Source Separation Using a Vector-Quantized Phase-Vocoder Representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661436/","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Monaural Source Separation Using a Vector-Quantized Phase-Vocoder Representation","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9162828","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1661436/","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Monaural Source Separation Using a Vector-Quantized Phase-Vocoder Representation","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159146S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"34761","articleId":"1661436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661439,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The most critical issue related to frequency domain BSS is the permutation problem. This paper presents two methods for solving this problem. Both methods are based on the clustering of information derived from a separation matrix obtained by ICA. The first method is based on direction of arrival (DOA) clustering. This approach is intuitive and easy to understand. The second method is based on normalized basis vector clustering. This method is less intuitive than the DOA based method, but it has several advantages. First, it does not need sensor array geometry information. Secondly, it can fully utilize the information contained in the separation matrix, since the clustering is performed in high-dimensional space. Experimental results show that our methods realize BSS in various situations such as the separation of many speech signals located in a 3-dimensional space, and the extraction of primary sound sources surrounded by many background interferences","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Source Separation of Many Signals in the Frequency Domain","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661439","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11024/34761/01661439.pdf","startPage":"V","endPage":"V","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind Source Separation of Many Signals in the Frequency Domain","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1661439/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9162831","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Source Separation of Many Signals in the Frequency Domain","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"01661439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06496S","chronDate":"14-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11024","isNumber":"34761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11024","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34761","articleId":"1661439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1661440,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A popular recent solution to these problems is based on the worst-case performance optimization. Unfortunately, in practical applications the actual worst case occurs with a very low probability and, as a result, the worst-case based designs may be overly conservative. As a less conservative alternative to the worst-case designs, the so-called probabilistically constrained designs are introduced. The latter approach guarantees that the distortionless response constraint is satisfied for a mismatched array response with a certain selected probability.

To date, specially in region-based analysis, the two questions have been addressed separately while intrinsically connected to each other. This situation motivates the need for new methods in neuroimaging that go beyond this unsatisfactory trade-off. In this paper, we propose a generalization of a region based Bayesian detection-estimation approach that addresses (i)-(ii) simultaneously as a bilinear inverse problem. The proposed extension relies on a 2-class Gamma-Gaussian prior mixture modeling to classify the voxels of the brain region either as activated or unactivated. Our approach provides both a spatial activity map and a HRF estimation using Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) techniques.

The average signal to interference and noise ratio (SENR) resulting from linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) combining is exploited to compute symbol error rate. Simulation results demonstrate that space-time block coding hardly achieves substantial transmitter diversity gains in asynchronous channels.

Our aim is to obtain an accurate mapping between the signal space and the physical space without requiring too much human calibration effort. This location estimation problem has traditionally been tackled through probabilistic models trained on manually labeled data, which are expensive to obtain. In contrast, our algorithm adopts kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) to build a nonlinear mapping between the signal-vector space and the physical location space by transforming data in both spaces into their canonical features. This allows the pairwise similarity of samples in both spaces to be maximally correlated using kernels. We use a Gaussian kernel to adapt to the noisy characteristics of signal strengths and a Matern kernel to sense the changes in physical locations. By using real data collected in an 802.11 wireless LAN environment, we achieve accurate location estimation for pervasive computing while requiring a much smaller set of labeled training data than previous methods","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/34762/01661510.pdf","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2006.145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2006.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Vector Regression for Accurate and Low-Cost Location Estimation in Pervasive Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Pervasive computing","Kernel","Wireless LAN","Signal mapping","Humans","Calibration","Signal analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","data mining","Gaussian processes","indoor radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","regression analysis","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional vector regression","indoor location estimation problem","pervasive computing","wireless local area network","802.11 WLAN","probabilistic model","kernel canonical correlation analysis","signal-vector space","physical location space","Gaussian kernel","Matern kernel","labeled training data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Location-dependent and sensitive","correlation and regression analysis","pervasive computing."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Vector Regression for Accurate and Low-Cost Location Estimation in Pervasive Computing","volume":"18","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1661510/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9069278","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Vector Regression for Accurate and Low-Cost Location Estimation in Pervasive Computing","sourcePdf":"01661510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095092S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"34762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"34762","articleId":"1661510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661524,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Embrey-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/34763/1661524/1661524-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianhua Liu received the BS degree in electrical engineering from Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China, in 1984, the MS degree in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 1987, the PhD degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998, and the PhD degree majoring in electrical engineering and minoring in statistics from the University of Florida in 2004.

For the packet design, we segment an entire packet into multiple subpackets - with each subpacket having zero tail bits to reset the convolutional channel encoder - so that the detection/decoding result of each subpacket can be used to update the channel response for this subpacket.

Contrary to most of the literature on topology control which focuses on reducing energy consumption, in this paper we tackle the topology control problem with the goal of limiting interference as much as possible, while keeping the communication graph connected with high probability. Our approach is based on the principle of maintaining the number of physical neighbors of every node equal to or slightly below a specific value k. As we will discuss in this paper, having a nontrivially bounded physical node degree allows a network topology with bounded interference to be generated. The proposed approach enforces symmetry on the resulting communication graph, thereby easing the operation of higher layer protocols. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we estimate the value of k that guarantees connectivity of the communication graph with high probability both theoretically and through simulation. We then define k-NEIGH, a fully distributed, asynchronous, and localized protocol that uses distance estimation. k-NEIGH guarantees logarithmically bounded physical degree at every node, is the most efficient known protocol (requiring 2n messages in total, where n is the number of nodes in the network), and relies on simpler assumptions than existing protocols. Furthermore, we verify through simulation that the network topologies produced by k-NEIGH show good performance in terms of node energy consumption and expected interference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/34763/01661534.pdf","startPage":"1267","endPage":"1282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34763","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The k-Neighbors Approach to Interference Bounded and Symmetric Topology Control in Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Network topology","Intelligent networks","Ad hoc networks","Energy consumption","Protocols","Communication system control","Mobile ad hoc networks","Availability","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","graph theory","interference suppression","protocols","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k-neighbors approach","symmetric topology control","ad hoc networks","interference reduction","communication graph","bounded interference","protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless ad hoc networks","topology control","spatial reuse","energy consumption","connectivity."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"The k-Neighbors Approach to Interference Bounded and Symmetric Topology Control in Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"5","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1661534/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9070534","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The k-Neighbors Approach to Interference Bounded and Symmetric Topology Control in Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"01661534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038635S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","isNumber":"34763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"105","articleId":"1661534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1661535,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The DCF uses a carrier sense multiple access scheme with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where the backoff parameters are fixed and determined by the standard. While those parameters were chosen to provide a good protocol performance, they fail to provide an optimum utilization of the channel in many scenarios. In particular, under heavy load scenarios, the utilization of the medium can drop tenfold. Most of the optimization mechanisms proposed in the literature are based on adapting the DCF backoff parameters to the estimate of the number of competing terminals in the network. However, existing estimation algorithms are either inaccurate or too complex. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of the IEEE 802.11 DCF that employs an adaptive estimator of the number of competing terminals based on sequential Monte Carlo methods. The algorithm uses a Bayesian approach, optimizing the backoff parameters of the DCF based on the predictive distribution of the number of competing terminals. We show that our algorithm is simple yet highly accurate even at small time scales. We implement our proposed new DCF in the ns-2 simulator and show that it outperforms existing methods. We also show that its accuracy can be used to improve the results of the protocol even when the terminals are not in saturation mode. Moreover, we show that there exists a Nash equilibrium strategy that prevents rogue terminals from changing their parameters for their own benefit, making the algorithm safely applicable in a complete distributed fashion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9070535","htmlLink":"/document/1661535/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Optimization of IEEE 802.11 DCF Based on Bayesian Estimation of the Number of Competing Terminals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Optimization of IEEE 802.11 DCF Based on Bayesian Estimation of the Number of Competing Terminals","sourcePdf":"01661535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092024S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"34763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"34763","articleId":"1661535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661541,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The objective of data partitioning and clustering is to coarse-grain the random walk on the data while at the same time preserving a diffusion operator for the intrinsic geometry or connectivity of the data set up to some accuracy.

Occlusions, if not properly handled, are a major source of failure. Solutions supporting principled occlusion reasoning have been proposed but are yet unpractical for online applications. This paper presents a new solution which effectively manages the trade-off between reliable modeling and computational efficiency. The hybrid joint-separable (HJS) filter is derived from a joint Bayesian formulation of the problem, and shown to be efficient while optimal in terms of compact belief representation. Computational efficiency is achieved by employing a Markov random field approximation to joint dynamics and an incremental algorithm for posterior update with an appearance likelihood that implements a physically-based model of the occlusion process. A particle filter implementation is proposed which achieves accurate tracking during partial occlusions, while in cases of complete occlusion, tracking hypotheses are bound to estimated occlusion volumes. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and able to resolve long-term occlusions between targets with identical appearance","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/34764/01661546.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Bayesian multibody tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Target tracking","Computational efficiency","Particle tracking","Robustness","Markov random fields","Particle filters","Computational modeling","Approximation algorithms","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Bayes methods","hidden feature removal","image processing","Markov processes","particle filtering (numerical methods)","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian multibody tracking","visual tracking","multiple targets","occlusion reasoning","hybrid joint-separable filter","Markov random field approximation","particle filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","tracking","occlusion","approximate inference","Bayes filter","particle filter."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Bayes Theorem","Computer Simulation","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Movement","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Bayesian multibody tracking","volume":"28","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1661546/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9050234","pubMedId":"16929730","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Bayesian multibody tracking","sourcePdf":"01661546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04979S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","isNumber":"34764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"127","articleId":"1661546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661547,"authors":[{"name":"Weiming Hu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Weiming Hu","id":"37087158055"},{"name":"Xuejuan Xiao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xuejuan Xiao","id":"37087160475"},{"name":"Zhouyu Fu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhouyu Fu","id":"37087177805"},{"name":"D.

Current approaches for the analysis of motion patterns depend on known scenes, where objects move in predefined ways. It is highly desirable to automatically construct object motion patterns which reflect the knowledge of the scene. In this paper, we present a system for automatically learning motion patterns for anomaly detection and behavior prediction based on a proposed algorithm for robustly tracking multiple objects. In the tracking algorithm, foreground pixels are clustered using a fast accurate fuzzy k-means algorithm. Growing and prediction of the cluster centroids of foreground pixels ensure that each cluster centroid is associated with a moving object in the scene. In the algorithm for learning motion patterns, trajectories are clustered hierarchically using spatial and temporal information and then each motion pattern is represented with a chain of Gaussian distributions. Based on the learned statistical motion patterns, statistical methods are used to detect anomalies and predict behaviors. Our system is tested using image sequences acquired, respectively, from a crowded real traffic scene and a model traffic scene.

However, there usually is time to train the system, which we would show to be very useful. Assuming that several registered images of the target object are available, we developed a keypoint-based approach that is effective in this context by formulating wide-baseline matching of keypoints extracted from the input images to those found in the model images as a classification problem. This shifts much of the computational burden to a training phase, without sacrificing recognition performance. As a result, the resulting algorithm is robust, accurate, and fast-enough for frame-rate performance. This reduction in runtime computational complexity is our first contribution. Our second contribution is to show that, in this context, a simple and fast keypoint detector suffices to support detection and tracking even under large perspective and scale variations. While earlier methods require a detector that can be expected to produce very repeatable results, in general, which usually is very time-consuming, we simply find the most repeatable object keypoints for the specific target object during the training phase. We have incorporated these ideas into a real-time system that detects planar, nonplanar, and deformable objects.

However, the images from these cameras are severely degraded by a fixed pattern noise (FPN). Previous attempts to improve the quality of the images from these cameras by removing an additive FPN have led to disappointing results. Using an existing model for the response of logarithmic pixels, it is concluded that the residual FPN in these images is caused by gain variations between pixels. In order to reduce the effects of these variations, a readout circuit, which is based upon a differential amplifier, has been used. However, even with this readout circuit, high-quality images will only be obtained if each image is corrected to remove the effects of both gain and offset variations. Measurement results are presented that show that the quality of the output from the logarithmic pixels is significantly improved if an electronic-calibration procedure is used to correct for both types of variations. In fact, with this procedure, the contrast sensitivity of the logarithmic pixels becomes comparable to that of the human eye over five decades of illumination intensity","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2006.877983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/34765/01661577.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2006.877983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34765","startPage":"950","endPage":"956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Electronic-Calibration Scheme for Logarithmic CMOS Pixels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Electronic-Calibration Scheme for Logarithmic CMOS Pixels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9008422","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1661577/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Electronic-Calibration Scheme for Logarithmic CMOS Pixels","sourcePdf":"01661577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057822S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"34765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"34765","articleId":"1661577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661589,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

Communication architectures should be flexible so as to offer high performance over a wide range of traffic characteristics. In particular, the resource sharing mechanism of the communication architecture, which determines how the often-conflicting requirements of different components are served, is of utmost importance. Conventional SoC architectures typically employ priority or time-division multiple-access (TDMA)-based communication architectures. However, these techniques are often inadequate. In the former, low-priority components may suffer from starvation, while in the latter, depending on the request profile, high-priority traffic may be subject to large latencies. This paper presents LOTTERYBUS, a high-performance SoC communication architecture based on new randomized on-chip communication protocols that addresses the shortcomings mentioned above. LOTTERYBUS provides each SoC component with a flexible, proportional, and probabilistically guaranteed share of the on-chip communication bandwidth. We present two variants of LOTTERYBUS. In the first variant, its architectural parameters are statically configured, leading to relatively low hardware overhead and design complexity. In the second variant, these parameters are allowed to vary dynamically, enabling more sophisticated use of LOTTERYBUS, at additional hardware cost. We have performed experiments to investigate the performance of LOTTERYBUS across a range of communication traffic characteristics. We have used LOTTERYBUS in designing a 4times4 ATM switch subsystem, and have compared its performance with conventional architectures. The results show that LOTTERYBUS provides fine-grained control over bandwidth allocation, and also provides significant reduction in average transaction latencies (up to 85%) compared to conventional architectures. Hardware implementations using a commercial 0.15-mum cell-based library indicate that the advantages provided by LOTTERYBUS are accompanied by modest hardware overheads compared to conventional architectures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/34766/01661600.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The LOTTERYBUS on-chip communication architecture","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2006.878210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2006.878210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"The LOTTERYBUS on-chip communication architecture","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9015844","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1661600/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The LOTTERYBUS on-chip communication architecture","sourcePdf":"01661600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061386S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"34766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"34766","articleId":"1661600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661609,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed methodology uses a static performance estimation technique extended for multitask applications to reduce the design space quickly and drastically and applies a trace-driven simulation to the reduced set of design candidates for accurate performance estimation. For the case that local memory traffics as well as shared memory traffics are involved in bus contention, memory allocation is considered as an important axis of the design space in our technique.

Instead, the communication architecture we propose is a superposition of a few long-range links and a standard mesh network. The few application-specific long-range links we insert significantly increase the critical traffic workload at which the network transitions from a free to a congested state. This way, we can exploit the benefits offered by both complete regularity and partial topology customization.

In previous papers, a cross-slot of unequal slot lengths was centered under the dielectric resonator (DR), resulting in circular polarized operation of the antenna. In the present study, the design is enhanced by setting the centers of the two slots at different positions and taking into consideration the partial independence of the slot modes from the DRA mode. Thus, circular polarization (CP) bandwidth of up to 4.7% is attained experimentally in the broadside direction. It is also shown that a largely asymmetrical structure results in a very high bandwidth, but with the tradeoff of distorted CP operation off-broadside","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2006.879484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/34768/01661644.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2006.879484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Offset Cross-Slot-Coupled Dielectric Resonator Antenna for Circular Polarization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661644/","displayDocTitle":"Offset Cross-Slot-Coupled Dielectric Resonator Antenna for Circular Polarization","volume":"16","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9012871","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1661644/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offset Cross-Slot-Coupled Dielectric Resonator Antenna for Circular Polarization","sourcePdf":"01661644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046275S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"34768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"34768","articleId":"1661644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661647,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-H.

Assuming that human faces belong to both the linear object class and the Lambertian object class, we span the face space and attribute space, respectively, by using groups of prototypes and merging ratio image (MRI). The MRI is defined as the seamless blend of individual expression ratio image, aging ratio image, and illumination ratio image (quotient image). The M-Face integrates the view space projection, shape caricaturing, and texture MRI-mapping techniques. Derived from the average face, the caricatured shape is reshaped to be more distinct by exaggerating individual distinctiveness, while the rerendered texture multiplies the MRI information during the caricaturing. Based on the M-Face model, the expression morphing, chronological aging or rejuvenating, and illumination variance can be merged seamlessly in a photorealistic style on desired view-rotated faces yielded by view morphing. This framework has the following advantages. First, 3-D reconstruction is avoided without weakening photorealistic effects. Second, the integration of shape caricaturing and texture MRI-mapping proves by experiments to be an efficient and computational inexpensive strategy for realistic face synthesis. Finally, the M-Face is a 2-D parameter-driven model, which highly simplifies user manipulations. The potential applications of M-Face are in various fields like virtual human face, speech-driven talking head, digital painting, film-making, and low-bit-rate communication","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.877398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34769","startPage":"830","endPage":"842","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34769/01661659.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-Face: An Appearance-Based Photorealistic Model for Multiple Facial Attributes Rendering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1661659/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"M-Face: An Appearance-Based Photorealistic Model for Multiple Facial Attributes Rendering","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9069840","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-Face: An Appearance-Based Photorealistic Model for Multiple Facial Attributes Rendering","sourcePdf":"01661659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091384S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"34769","articleId":"1661659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661660,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

Though efficient architectures have been proposed for a block coder operating in specific modes, existing generic block coder architectures have low throughput versus hardware cost performance. In this paper, we present a low-cost, high-throughput VLSI architecture for a generic block coder. Concurrent symbol processing (CSP) is used to improve throughput of the block coder's submodules, the bit plane coder (BPC) and arithmetic coder (AC). The proposed BPC processes one stripe-column/clock-cycle during every coding pass and generates up to 10 context-data (CxD) pairs/clock-cycle. The proposed AC processes two CxD/clock-cycles. Throughput is then further increased by using column speedup and novel run-mode skipping techniques at the BPC module. Hardware cost for the proposed block coder is reduced by using an optimal two-subbank BPC memory architecture. Additionally, image statistics are used to choose efficient configuration parameters for the VLSI architecture. The proposed block coder is implemented on Altera stratix FPGA and TSMC ASIC 0.18-mum platforms. Implementation results show that our block coder has average throughputs of 16.23 and 73.42 Msamples/s, respectively, on the FPGA and ASIC platforms. The block-coder test chip has 22515 gates and 2.33 mm \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n chip area.

CT measurement data are degraded by a number of factors-including beam hardening and off-focal radiation-that produce artifacts in reconstructed images unless properly corrected. Currently, such effects are addressed by a sequence of sinogram-preprocessing steps, including deconvolution corrections for off-focal radiation, that have the potential to amplify noise. Noise itself is generally mitigated through apodization of the reconstruction kernel, which effectively ignores the measurement statistics, although in high-noise situations adaptive filtering methods that loosely model data statistics are sometimes applied. As an alternative, we present a general imaging model relating the degraded measurements to the sinogram of ideal line integrals and propose to estimate these line integrals by iteratively optimizing a statistically based objective function. We consider three different strategies for estimating the set of ideal line integrals, one based on direct estimation of ideal \"monochromatic\" line integrals that have been corrected for single-material beam hardening, one based on estimation of ideal \"polychromatic\" line integrals that can be readily mapped to monochromatic line integrals, and one based on estimation of ideal transmitted intensities, from which ideal, monochromatic line integrals can be readily estimated. The first two approaches involve maximization of a penalized Poisson-likelihood objective function while the third involves minimization of a quadratic penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) objective applied in the transmitted intensity domain. We find that at low exposure levels typical of those being considered for screening CT, the Poisson-likelihood based approaches outperform the PWLS objective as well as a standard approach based on adaptive filtering followed by deconvolution. At higher exposure levels, the approaches all perform similarly","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Penalized-likelihood sinogram restoration for computed tomography","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2006.875429","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/34770/01661697.pdf","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2006.875429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Penalized-likelihood sinogram restoration for computed tomography","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1661697/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9057011","pubMedId":"16894995","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Penalized-likelihood sinogram restoration for computed tomography","sourcePdf":"01661697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101083S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"34770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"34770","articleId":"1661697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661745,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.

As system architects and designers leverage ever-increasing CMOS technology densities, a range of two- and three-dimensional silicon integration technologies are emerging which will likely support next-generation high-volume electronic applications and may serve high-performance computing applications. This paper will discuss a few emerging technologies which offer opportunities for enhanced circuit performance, or reduced power as one example. Silicon-on-silicon integration may include three-dimensional (3-D) integration on-chip or may leverage chip stacking or chip integration on package. Common technology features include silicon through-vias, high-I/O interconnection and silicon-on-silicon either as 3-D integrated circuits, integrated chip stacks or silicon-on-silicon packages with passive function or high-bandwidth wiring. Silicon chips on silicon interposers with integrated function such as decoupling capacitors may provide a better module architecture compared to increased on-chip decoupling or off chip discrete capacitors mounted on package at the chip perimeter or underside of the package. Advanced silicon carrier package technology with fine pitch (50 mum) interconnection is described. This silicon carrier package contains silicon through-vias and offers >16times increase over standard chip I/O, a 20times to 100times increase in wiring density over traditional organic and ceramic packaging, and allows for integrated high-performance passives. Silicon carrier technology supports lithographic scaling and provides a basis for known good die (KGD) wafer testing. It may be considered for use in a number of applications including optoelectronic (OE) transceivers, silicon interposers with integrated decoupling capacitors, and mini-multi-chip modules (MMCMs) which integrate heterogeneous dies forming a single \"virtual chip.\"","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.877252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/34772/01661748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.877252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34772","startPage":"1718","endPage":"1725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Silicon Integration and Silicon Packaging Technology Using Silicon Through-Vias","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3-D Silicon Integration and Silicon Packaging Technology Using Silicon Through-Vias","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"41","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9010773","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1661748/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Silicon Integration and Silicon Packaging Technology Using Silicon Through-Vias","sourcePdf":"01661748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137921S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"34772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"34772","articleId":"1661748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661749,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A UWB beam-former prototype for imaging applications has been fabricated with the potential to yield 20 mm of range resolution and a 7deg angular resolution from a four-element array with 10 mm element spacing. The UWB beam-former accomplishes a 4-bit delay variation for a total of 64 ps of achievable group delay with a 4-ps resolution, a 5-dB gain variation in 1-dB steps, and a worst case -3-dB gain bandwidth of 13 GHz.

The tail current is made large when the oscillator output voltage reaches its maximum or minimum value and when the sensitivity of the output phase to injected noise is the smallest; the tail current is made small during the zero crossings of the output voltage when the phase noise sensitivity is large. The phase noise contributions of the active devices are decreased and the VCO has a larger oscillation amplitude and thus better DC to RF conversion compared to a standard VCO with equal power dissipation. A circuit design to implement tail current-shaping is presented that does not dissipate any extra power, does not use additional (noisy) active devices and occupies a small area. The operation and performance of the presented circuit is extensively analyzed and compared to an ideal pulse biased technique.

It is demonstrated that the characteristic current densities also remain invariant for the most common circuit topologies such as MOSFET cascodes, MOS-SiGe HBT cascodes, current-mode logic (CML) gates, and nMOS transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) with active pMOSFET loads. As a consequence, it is proposed that constant current-density biasing schemes be applied to MOSFET analog/mixed-signal/RF and high-speed digital circuit design. This will alleviate the problem of ever-diminishing effective gate voltages as CMOS is scaled below 90 nm, and will reduce the impact of statistical process variation, temperature and bias current variation on circuit performance. The second half of the paper illustrates that constant current-density biasing allows for the porting of SiGe BiCMOS cascode operational amplifiers, low-noise CMOS TIAs, and MOS-CML and BiCMOS-CML logic gates and output drivers between technology nodes and foundries, and even from bulk CMOS to SOI processes, with little or no redesign. Examples are provided of several record-setting circuits such as: 1) SiGe BiCMOS operational amplifiers with up to 37-GHz unity gain bandwidth; 2) a 2.5-V SiGe BiCMOS high-speed logic chip set consisting of 49-GHz retimer, 40-GHz TIAs, 80-GHz output driver with pre-emphasis and output swing control; and 3) 1-V 90-nm bulk and SOI CMOS TIAs with over 26-GHz bandwidth, less than 8-dB noise figure and operating at data rates up to 38.8 Gb/s. Such building blocks are required for the next generation of low-power 40-80 Gb/s wireline transceivers","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.875301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/34772/01661759.pdf","startPage":"1830","endPage":"1845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.875301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Invariance of Characteristic Current Densities in Nanoscale MOSFETs and Its Impact on Algorithmic Design Methodologies and Design Porting of Si(Ge) (Bi)CMOS High-Speed Building Blocks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"The Invariance of Characteristic Current Densities in Nanoscale MOSFETs and Its Impact on Algorithmic Design Methodologies and Design Porting of Si(Ge) (Bi)CMOS High-Speed Building Blocks","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1661759/","accessionNumber":"9010784","volume":"41","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Invariance of Characteristic Current Densities in Nanoscale MOSFETs and Its Impact on Algorithmic Design Methodologies and Design Porting of Si(Ge) (Bi)CMOS High-Speed Building Blocks","sourcePdf":"01661759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119965S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"34772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"34772","articleId":"1661759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661760,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.A. Ali","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Greensboro, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/34772/1661760/1661760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed M.

It also has a sampling buffer that is turned off during the hold clock phases to save power. To accurately estimate and minimize the clock jitter, a new jitter simulation technique was used whose results were verified on silicon. The measured silicon results indicate the highest published IF sampling performance to date and prove the viability of the \"SHA-less\" architecture for IF/RF sampling ADCs. The ADC is calibration-free and achieves a DNL of less than 0.2 LSB and INL of 0.8 LSB. The SNR is 75 dB below Nyquist, and stays above 71 dB up to 500 MHz.

The filter is intended for polarization-mode dispersion compensation in 40-Gb/s long-haul single-mode optical fiber links. A novel filter topology is employed, whereby each tap gain comprises a cascade of two distributed amplifiers with adjustable gain. The same lumped LC ladders that provide the 25-ps tap delays also serve as artificial transmission lines for the distributed tap amplifiers.

This is primarily due to a basic need to maximize efficiency by running the power management IC on as low supply voltage as possible, while still maintaining the ability to sample and measure quantities from the surroundings that could well exceed the battery voltage. In this paper, a new bootstrapped switch is presented. The switch enables the precise sampling of input signals well greater than the chip supply voltage with no static power consumption, and without activating on-chip parasitic body diodes. The bootstrapped switch, presented here, is designed to sample an input signal with a 0-5.5-V range at a supply voltage of 2.75 V.

The proposed model is composed of two existing electromagnetic-scattering models, one for the foliage and the other for the hard targets that are coupled in a computationally efficient manner. The connection between these two models, which accounts for the interaction between the foliage scatterers and the target, is accomplished through the application of Huygens' principle. Wave penetration through the forest canopy and near-field and far-field scattering from its constituents is calculated using a coherent single-scattering theory, which makes use of realistic tree structures. Defining a Huygens' surface enclosing the hard target and calculating the illuminating field (the scattered fields from the nearby vegetation scatterers and reduced incident field), the interaction between the foliage and the hard target is accounted for. Computing the scattered field from target on the Huygens' surface and using a reciprocity theorem target-foliage interaction is captured very efficiently. Calculation of scattering from a hard target is carried out using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique.

In this paper, the authors present a new spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) algorithm to blend Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance. Using this approach, high-frequency temporal information from MODIS and high-resolution spatial information from Landsat can be blended for applications that require high resolution in both time and space. The MODIS daily 500-m surface reflectance and the 16-day repeat cycle Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30-m surface reflectance are used to produce a synthetic \"daily\" surface reflectance product at ETM+ spatial resolution. The authors present results both with simulated (model) data and actual Landsat/MODIS acquisitions.

Errors in the atmospheric corrections can often be easily identified in a seasonal trajectory of a surface parameter because the atmospheric effect generally causes erratic reductions in vegetation indices. A locally adjusted cubic-spline capping (LACC) method is developed here to screen affected data points in a pixel and to replace them through temporal interpolation. In LACC, a variable local smoothing parameter, which controls the local smoothness of the fitted curve, is automatically determined according to the local curvature of the original seasonal variation pattern. An iteration procedure is designed to produce a seasonal capping curve by progressively replacing abnormally low values with fitted values. This method has two advantages over existing methods based on harmonics, namely: 1) cubic splines are flexible for simulating a wide range of seasonal variation patterns and 2) a variable local smoothing parameter allows the fitted capping curve to mimic either rapid or slow variation patterns in various seasons. The capping curve is also mathematically differentiable for further applications.

Conventional anomaly-detection algorithms are based upon the popular Reed-Xiaoli detector. However, these algorithms typically suffer from large numbers of false alarms due to the assumptions that the local background is Gaussian and homogeneous. In practice, these assumptions are often violated, especially when the neighborhood of a pixel contains multiple types of terrain. To remove these assumptions, a novel anomaly detector that incorporates a nonparametric background model based on the SVDD is derived. Expanding on prior SVDD work, a geometric interpretation of the SVDD is used to propose a decision rule that utilizes a new test statistic and shares some of the properties of constant false-alarm rate detectors. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the authors report results that demonstrate the improved performance and reduction in the false-alarm rate when using the SVDD-based detector on wide-area airborne mine detection (WAAMD) and hyperspectral digital imagery collection experiment (HYDICE) imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661816/","volume":"44","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1661816/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9021288","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A support vector method for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A support vector method for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","sourcePdf":"01661816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102988S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"34774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"34774","articleId":"1661816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1661825,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While classical capacity is not enough, another sense of capacity (parametrized by reliability) called \"anytime capacity\" is necessary for the stabilization of an unstable process. The required rate is given by the log of the unstable system gain and the required reliability comes from the sense of stability desired. A consequence of this necessity result is a sequential generalization of the Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme for communication over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. In cases of sufficiently rich information patterns between the encoder and decoder, adequate anytime capacity is also shown to be sufficient for there to exist a stabilizing controller.

We introduce practical new tools for communicating at all rates in the achievable region. The technique employs a simple \"source-splitting\" strategy that does not require common sources of randomness at the encoders and decoders. This approach allows for pipelined encoding and decoding so that the system operates with the complexity of a single user encoder and decoder. Moreover, when this splitting approach is used in conjunction with iterative decoding methods, it produces a significant simplification of the decoding process. We demonstrate this approach for synthetically generated data. Finally, we consider the Slepian-Wolf problem when linear codes are used as syndrome-formers and consider a linear programming relaxation to maximum-likelihood (ML) sequence decoding. We note that the fractional vertices of the relaxed polytope compete with the optimal solution in a manner analogous to that observed when the \"min-sum\" iterative decoding algorithm is applied. This relaxation exhibits the ML-certificate property: if an integral solution is found, it is the ML solution. For symmetric binary joint distributions, we show that selecting easily constructable \"expander\"-style low-density parity check codes (LDPCs) as syndrome-formers admits a positive error exponent and therefore provably good performance","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.878215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/34775/01661834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.878215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34775","startPage":"3546","endPage":"3561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Approaches to Slepian\u2013Wolf Near-Lossless Distributed Data Compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1661834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Approaches to Slepian\u2013Wolf Near-Lossless Distributed Data Compression","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1661834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9010863","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1661834/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Approaches to Slepian\u2013Wolf Near-Lossless Distributed Data Compression","sourcePdf":"01661834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087158S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"34775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"34775","articleId":"1661834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1661836,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.M.

In particular, we extend the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff investigated by Zheng and Tse in standard delay-limited MIMO channels with coherent detection to the ARQ scenario. We establish the three-dimensional tradeoff between reliability (i.e., diversity), throughput (i.e., multiplexing gain), and delay (i.e., maximum number of retransmissions). This tradeoff quantifies the ARQ diversity gain obtained by leveraging the retransmission delay to enhance the reliability for a given multiplexing gain. Interestingly, ARQ diversity appears even in long-term static channels where all the retransmissions take place in the same channel state. Furthermore, by relaxing the input power constraint allowing variable power levels in different retransmissions, we show that power control can be used to dramatically increase the diversity advantage. Our analysis reveals some important insights on the benefits of ARQ in slow-fading MIMO channels. In particular, we show that 1) allowing for a sufficiently large retransmission delay results in an almost flat diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, and hence, renders operating at high multiplexing gain more advantageous; 2) MIMO ARQ channels quickly approach the ergodic limit when power control is employed. Finally, we complement our information-theoretic analysis with an incremental redundancy lattice space-time (IR-LAST) coding scheme which is shown, through a random coding argument, to achieve the optimal tradeoff(s). An integral component of the optimal IR-LAST coding scheme is a list decoder, based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) lattice decoding principle, for joint error detection and correction.

This approach is especially effective if the parity-check matrix of a code is a matrix composed of blocks of circulant permutation matrices, as is the case for the class of codes known as array codes. We show how to shorten array codes by deleting certain columns of their parity-check matrices so as to increase their girth. The shortening approach is based on the observation that for array codes, and in fact for a slightly more general class of LDPC codes, the cycles in the corresponding Tanner graph are governed by certain homogeneous linear equations with integer coefficients. Consequently, we can selectively eliminate cycles from an array code by only retaining those columns from the parity-check matrix of the original code that are indexed by integer sequences that do not contain solutions to the equations governing those cycles. We provide Ramsey-theoretic estimates for the maximum number of columns that can be retained from the original parity-check matrix with the property that the sequence of their indices avoid solutions to various types of cycle-governing equations. This translates to estimates of the rate penalty incurred in shortening a code to eliminate cycles.

The proposed iterative algorithm uses the sum-product algorithm (SPA) in conjunction with a binary parity-check matrix of the RS code. The novelty is in reducing a submatrix of the binary parity-check matrix that corresponds to less reliable bits to a sparse nature before the SPA is applied at each iteration. The proposed algorithm can be geometrically interpreted as a two-stage gradient descent with an adaptive potential function. This adaptive procedure is crucial to the convergence behavior of the gradient descent algorithm and, therefore, significantly improves the performance.

One can show that monopulse estimation is based on a general approximation derived from maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. This tutorial provides a derivation of this relation and presents extensions of this monopulse principle to multi-dimensional array and parameter estimation problems, in particular to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) with reduced dimension, subarrays and generalized sidelobe canceller (GSLC) configurations. The performance of these monopulse applications can be predicted by exploiting the distribution of the monopulse ratio. It is demonstrated that this distribution is more realistic than the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Several examples of performance of monopulse estimators are given for thinned and fully filled planar arrays, adaptive beamforming with and without low sidelobes, GSLC, and STAP.

The motivation behind this approach is based upon the desire to increase the number of control electrodes, which requires the implementation of on-chip line-column microelectronics. Increasing the number of electrodes is attractive as it provides the opportunity to finely adjust droplet size, and also increases the number of droplets that can be individually moved simultaneously. The tradeoffs associated with minimising the drive voltage by appropriate choice of dielectric thickness, strength and permittivity, are discussed and examples presented of systems with the ability to move liquid droplets using voltages between 27 and 70V. A small electrode array has been designed using transistors with high voltage shields using a 100V CMOS process. This circuitry has been fabricated and can successfully apply 90V to the electrodes. The paper presents the considerations related to the chip design and the issues associated with EWOD post-processing and the microfluidic packaging requirements.","doi":"10.1049/ic:20060442","publicationTitle":"The Institution of Engineering and Technology Seminar on MEMS Sensors and Actuators 2006","displayPublicationTitle":"The Institution of Engineering and Technology Seminar on MEMS Sensors and Actuators 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/11029/34788/01662172.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:20060442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34788","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building EWOD Microfluidic Array Technology on Top of Foundry CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1662172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Building EWOD Microfluidic Array Technology on Top of Foundry CMOS","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662172/","conferenceDate":"28-28 April 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"10076112","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building EWOD Microfluidic Array Technology on Top of Foundry CMOS","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1662172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048372S","chronDate":"28-28 April 2006","isNumber":"34788","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11029","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1662172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1662293,"authors":[{"name":"Sanghoon Sung","affiliation":["WiBro System Team, Telecommunication Network R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sanghoon Sung","id":"38034311300"},{"name":"In-Seok Hwang","affiliation":["WiBro System Team, Telecommunication Network R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"In-Seok Hwang","id":"37829762700"},{"name":"Soonyoung Yoon","affiliation":["WiBro System Team, Telecommunication Network R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Soonyoung Yoon","id":"37066069400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0146-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1662293","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Fading","Throughput","Communication system control","Frequency domain analysis","Delay","Telecommunication control","Intelligent networks","Research and development","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","probability","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data rate control","OFDMA systems","primitive allocation unit","sub-carrier locations-diversity sub-channel","AMC sub-channel","reduced channel selectivity","multi-user scheduling gain","cell edge data rate","service outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-user Diversity","OFDMA","System Throughput","AMC sub-channel","Diversity sub-channel"]}],"abstract":"Unlike single carrier systems, the primitive allocation unit in OFDMA systems is a sub-channel that is a collection of pre-arranged sub-carriers, and these sub-channels can be divided into two groups depending on the sub-carrier locations-diversity sub-channel and AMC sub-channel. The former consists of scattered sub-carriers over entire band while the latter consists of clustered sub-carriers on specific frequency band. For the case of AMC sub-channels, we can achieve link level SNR gain due to the reduced channel selectivity as well as system level multi-user scheduling gain due to the increased degree of freedom in selecting frequency bands. This paper investigates the performance difference between these two sub-channel types, specifically in terms of average throughputs, cell edge data rate and service outage probability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Gain of Data Rate Control in OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE International Workshop on Broadband Convergence Networks","doi":"10.1109/BCN.2006.1662293","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE International Workshop on Broadband Convergence Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11033/34792/01662293.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BCN.2006.1662293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1662293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-7 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"On the Gain of Data Rate Control in OFDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"7-7 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1662293/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"10208125","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Gain of Data Rate Control in OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01662293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04705S","chronDate":"7-7 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11033","isNumber":"34792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34792","articleId":"1662293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1662305,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Hua Wu","affiliation":[" College of Economic and Management, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Guo-Hua Wu","id":"37087930695"},{"name":"Rong-Yang Wu","affiliation":["College of Information and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Rong-Yang Wu","id":"37087930870"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0020-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1662305","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heat transfer","Particle swarm optimization","Cooling","Steel","Casting","Solid modeling","Temperature control","Optimization methods","Chaos","Billets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["casting","convection","cooling","manufacturing processes","particle swarm optimisation","steel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm algorithm","steel continuous casting process","solidification model","control volume method","convective heat transfer coefficient","billet surface temperature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Billet","continuous casting","convection heat coefficient","chaotic","particle swarm optimization algorithm","simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1662305","abstract":"Solidification model is developed based on control volume method for steel continuous casting process, which is nonlinear and non-differential, and parameters of convective heat transfer coefficient for each segment of the secondary cooling zone are ascertained, a new hybrid particle swarm algorithm (CPSO) is introduced to improve the optimizing performance by embedding the chaotic search in the particles swarm algorithm.

In principle, RL can automatically learn high-quality management policies without an explicit performance model or traffic model and with little or no built-in system specific knowledge. In our original work [1], [2], [3] we showed the feasibility of using online RL to learn resource valuation estimates (in lookup table form) which can be used to make high-quality server allocation decisions in a multi-application prototype Data Center scenario. The present work shows how to combine the strengths of both RL and queuing models in a hybrid approach in which RL trains offline on data collected while a queuing model policy controls the system. By training offline we avoid suffering potentially poor performance in live online training. We also now use RL to train nonlinear function approximators (e.g. multi-layer perceptrons) instead of lookup tables; this enables scaling to substantially larger state spaces. Our results now show that in both open-loop and closed-loop traffic, hybrid RL training can achieve significant performance improvements over a variety of initial model-based policies. We also find that, as expected, RL can deal effectively with both transients and switching delays, which lie outside the scope of traditional steady-state queuing theory.","doi":"10.1109/ICAC.2006.1662383","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/11035/34794/01662383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC.2006.1662383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34794","startPage":"65","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomic Resource Allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1662383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomic Resource Allocation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662383/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1662383/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomic Resource Allocation","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"01662383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055879S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11035","isNumber":"34794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11035","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"34794","articleId":"1662383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1662394,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A key unresolved obstacle to the practical implementation of thermal load management is the ability to predict the effects of workload distribution and cooling configurations on temperatures within a data center enclosure. The interactions between workload, cooling and temperature are dependent on complex factors that are unique to each data center, including physical room layout, hardware power consumption and cooling capacity; this dictates an approach that formulates management policies for each data center based on these properties. We propose and evaluate a simple, flexible method to infer a detailed model of thermal behavior within a data center from a stream of instrumentation data. This data - taken during normal data center operation - includes continuous readings taken from external temperature sensors, server instrumentation and computer room air conditioning units. Experimental results from a representative data center show that automatic thermal mapping can predict accurately the heat distribution resulting from a given workload distribution and cooling configuration, thereby removing the need for static or manual configuration of thermal load management systems. We also demonstrate how our approach adapts to preserve accuracy across changes to cluster attributes that affect thermal behavior - such as cooling settings, workload distribution and power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ICAC.2006.1662394","startPage":"155","endPage":"164","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/11035/34794/01662394.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC.2006.1662394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weatherman: Automated, Online and Predictive Thermal Mapping and Management for Data Centers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal management","Cooling","Thermal loading","Load management","Thermal resistance","Energy consumption","Instruments","Costs","Temperature distribution","Temperature dependence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Weatherman: Automated, Online and Predictive Thermal Mapping and Management for Data Centers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1662394/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weatherman: Automated, Online and Predictive Thermal Mapping and Management for Data Centers","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"01662394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060148S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11035","isNumber":"34794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11035","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"34794","articleId":"1662394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1662434,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be able to communicate efficiently. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that optimizes the NP-hard tradeoff. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build non-parametric probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes (GPs) both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication cost of un-sensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time, data-driven algorithm, pSPIEL, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and cost-Effective Locations. Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity, formalizing the intuition that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality, under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our pSPlEL approach. We also provide extensive experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9026698","htmlLink":"/document/1662434/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Near-optimal sensor placements: maximizing information while minimizing communication cost","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-optimal sensor placements: maximizing information while minimizing communication cost","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01662434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062935S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11036","isNumber":"34795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11036","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"34795","articleId":"1662434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":1662437,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We focus on applications of environmental monitoring, in which the goal is to reconstruct a spatial map of environmental factors of interest. Traditional sampling theory deals with data collection processes that are completely independent of the target map to be estimated, aside from possible a priori specifications reflective of assumed properties of the target. We refer to such processes as passive learning methods. Alternatively, one can envision sequential, adaptive data collection procedures that use information gleaned from previous observations to guide the process. We refer to such feedback-driven processes as active learning methods. Active learning is naturally suited to mobile path planning, in which previous samples are used to guide the motion of the mobiles for further sampling. This paper presents some of the most encouraging theoretical results to date that support the effectiveness of active over passive learning, and focuses on new results regarding the capabilities of active learning methods for mobile sensing. Tradeoffs between latency, path lengths, and accuracy are carefully assessed using our theory. Adaptive path planning methods are developed to guide mobiles in order to focus attention in interesting regions of the sensing domain, thus conducting spatial surveys much more rapidly while maintaining the accuracy of the estimated map. The theory and methods are illustrated in the application of water current mapping in a freshwater lake.","doi":"10.1145/1127777.1127790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1127777.1127790","startPage":"60","endPage":"68","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11036/34795/01662441.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active learning for adaptive mobile sensing networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Active learning for adaptive mobile sensing networks","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1662441/","accessionNumber":"9026705","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662441/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active learning for adaptive mobile sensing networks","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01662441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06428S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11036","isNumber":"34795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11036","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"34795","articleId":"1662441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1662442,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of compressive wireless sensing for sensor networks in which a fusion center retrieves signal field information from an ensemble of spatially distributed sensor nodes. Energy and bandwidth are scarce resources in sensor networks and the relevant metrics of interest in our context are 1) the latency involved in information retrieval; and 2) the associated power-distortion trade-off. It is generally recognized that given sufficient prior knowledge about the sensed data (e.g., statistical characterization, homogeneity etc.), there exist schemes that have very favorable power-distortion-latency trade-offs. We propose a distributed matched source-channel communication scheme, based in part on recent results in compressive sampling theory, for estimation of sensed data at the fusion center and analyze, as a function of number of sensor nodes, the trade-offs between power, distortion and latency. Compressive wireless sensing is a universal scheme in the sense that it requires no prior knowledge about the sensed data. This universality, however, comes at the cost of optimality (in terms of a less favorable power-distortion-latency trade-off) and we quantify this cost relative to the case when sufficient prior information about the sensed data is assumed","doi":"10.1145/1127777.1127801","publicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11036/34795/01662451.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1127777.1127801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive wireless sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1662451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662451/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive wireless sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9026714","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1662451/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive wireless sensing","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01662451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057172S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11036","isNumber":"34795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11036","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"34795","articleId":"1662451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1662455,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Each node can take a finite or infinite number of measurements, at arbitrary times (i.e., asynchronously). We propose a space-time diffusion scheme that relies only on peer-to-peer communication, and allows every node to asymptotically compute the global maximum-likelihood estimate of the unknown parameters. At each iteration, information is diffused across the network by a temporal update step and a spatial update step. Both steps update each node's state by a weighted average of its current value and locally available data: new measurements for the time update, and neighbors' data for the spatial update. At any time, any node can compute a local weighted least-squares estimate of the unknown parameters, which converges to the global maximum-likelihood solution. With an infinite number of measurements, these estimates converge to the true parameter values in the sense of mean-square convergence.

This raises the need for providing periodic sleep cycles for the radios in the sensor nodes. Keeping sensors in sleep state also implies that node to sink communication incurs certain delays and there exists a threshold on the duty cycling for the communication delay to be bounded, giving rise to an upperbound on the lifetime of the network i.e., the time until at least one node in the network is able to communicate its sensed data to the sink. This paper aims at establishing tight analytical bounds on the sleeping probabilities of nodes and on the achievable lifetime of wireless sensor networks in a very generic setting. Bounds on the sleeping probability need to be satisfied for proper network functionality. Further, an energy efficient deployment scheme is suggested wherein the battery power depletion is fairly uniformly deployed throughout the network. This scheme makes use of the availability of low power auxiliary channel listening radio. With this scheme, we shown that an improvement in lifetime by a factor of O(radicn/log n) over uniform distribution of nodes is achievable, where n is the number of nodes in the network. We also show that the throughput capacity of the network is also improved by the same factor. We show also that the maximum lifetime of the network is bounded above by O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3/2</sup>\n/radiclog n).

Local collaboration among nodes decorrelates measurements, yielding a sparser data set with significant values at far fewer nodes. Sparsity can then be leveraged for subsequent processing such as measurement compression, denoising, and query routing. A number of factors complicate realizing such a transform in real-world deployments, including irregular spatial placement of nodes and a potentially prohibitive energy cost associated with calculating the transform in-network. In this paper, we address these concerns head-on; our contributions are fourfold. First, we propose a simple interpolatory wavelet transform for irregular sampling grids. Second, using ns-2 simulations of network traffic generated by the transform, we establish for a variety of network configurations break-even points in network size beyond which multiscale data processing provides energy savings. Distributed lossy compression of network measurements provides a representative application for this study. Third, we develop a new protocol for extracting approximations given only a vague notion of source statistics and analyze its energy savings over a more intuitive but naive approach. Finally, we extend the 2-dimensional (2-D) spatial irregular grid transform to a 3-D spatio-temporal transform, demonstrating the substantial gain of distributed 3-D compression over repeated 2-D compression.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet analysis","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Collaboration","Decorrelation","Noise reduction","Query processing","Costs","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","signal sampling","telecommunication traffic","protocols","spatiotemporal phenomena","wireless sensor networks","data compression","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed wavelet analysis","sensor network","interpolatory wavelet transform","sampling grid","ns-2 simulation","network traffic","network break-even point","multiscale data processing","network measurement","protocol","2D spatial irregular grid transform","3D spatio-temporal transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed wavelet analysis","irregular grid wavelet analysis","sensor networks","compression","multiscale analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1145/1127777.1127816","publicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11036/34795/01662464.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1127777.1127816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture for distributed wavelet analysis and processing in sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1662464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for distributed wavelet analysis and processing in sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662464/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1662464/","accessionNumber":"9026727","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for distributed wavelet analysis and processing in sensor networks","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01662464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056253S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11036","isNumber":"34795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11036","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"34795","articleId":"1662464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1662471,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The final goal is to have a reconstructed version of the data measurements at the central node, with the sensors spending as little energy as possible, for a given data reconstruction accuracy. In our scenario, sensors in the network have a choice of different coding schemes to achieve varying levels of compression. The compression algorithms considered are based on the lifting factorization of the wavelet transform, and exploit the natural data flow in the network to aggregate data by computing partial wavelet coefficients that are refined as data flows towards the central node. The proposed algorithm operates by first selecting a routing strategy through the network. Then, for each route, an optimal combination of data representation algorithms i.e. assignment at each node, is selected. A simple heuristic is used to determine the data representation technique to use once path merges are taken into consideration. We demonstrate that by optimizing the coding algorithm selection the overall energy consumption can be significantly reduced when compared to the case when data is just quantized and forwarded to the central node. Moreover, the proposed algorithm provides a tool to compare different routing techniques and identify those that are most efficient overall, for given node locations. We evaluate the algorithm using both a second-order autoregressive (AR) model and empirical data from a real wireless sensor network deployment","doi":"10.1145/1127777.1127824","publicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11036/34795/01662472.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1127777.1127824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient data representation and routing for wireless sensor networks based on a distributed wavelet compression algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1662472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662472/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient data representation and routing for wireless sensor networks based on a distributed wavelet compression algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9026735","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1662472/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient data representation and routing for wireless sensor networks based on a distributed wavelet compression algorithm","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01662472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064746S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11036","isNumber":"34795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11036","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"34795","articleId":"1662472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1662485,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The testbed covers an area of approximately 50,000 square meters and was in continuous operation during the last four months of 2005. This new testbed in one of the largest solar-powered outdoor sensor networks ever constructed and it offers a unique platform on which both systems and application software can be tested safely at scale. The testbed is based on Trio, a new mote platform that provides sustainable operation, enables efficient in situ interaction, and supports fail-safe programming. The motivation behind this testbed was to evaluate robust multi-target tracking algorithms at scale. However, using the testbed has stressed the system software, networking protocols, and management tools in ways that have exposed subtle but serious weaknesses that were never discovered using indoor testbeds or smaller deployments. We have been iteratively improving our support software, with the eventual aim of creating a stable hardware-software platform for sustainable, scalable, and flexible testbed deployments","publicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11036/34795/01662485.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"415","doi":"10.1145/1127777.1127839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1127777.1127839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trio: enabling sustainable and scalable outdoor wireless sensor network deployments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1662485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Trio: enabling sustainable and scalable outdoor wireless sensor network deployments","htmlLink":"/document/1662485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9026748","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trio: enabling sustainable and scalable outdoor wireless sensor network deployments","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01662485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086828S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11036","isNumber":"34795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11036","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"34795","articleId":"1662485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1662538,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

In this design model, software transformations are first applied to put the algorithm to be implemented into a regular form conducive to systolic implementation. The steps of allocating operations to hardware, scheduling their execution, and optimizing the design are then performed bottom-up, starting with the innermost blocks of the algorithm. We have successfully used this model to rederive several published designs, and it appears suitable for designing complex systolic arrays. This model may help guide manual design, explain systolic algorithms, or capture the design process in the machine where it can benefit from effective automated

Hopfield networks are iterative Auto-Associative networks consisting of a single layer of fully connected processing elements thus categorizes as an associative memory. Associative memories provide one approach to the computer-engineering problem of storing and retrieving data which is based on content rather than storage address. HNN deals with the bipolar system (i.e. -1 and +1) for direct input data, however it is useful for binary images, but unuseful for gray-level or color images unless we suppose another way for input data of such images. To overcome this obstacle, one can suppose for 8-bit gray-level image that consists of 8-layers (bitplanes) of binaries can be represented as bipolar data. In this way it is possible to express each bitplane as single binary image for HNN. The experimental results showed the usefulness of using HNN in gray-level images recognition with good results. Furthermore, there are no limitations to the number of 8-bit gray level images that can be stored in the net memory with the same efficient results.","doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2006.49","startPage":"236","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation (CGIV'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2006.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34835","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation (CGIV'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11040/34835/01663798.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gray Image Recognition Using Hopfield Neural Network With Multi-Bitplane and Multi-Connect Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1663798/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gray Image Recognition Using Hopfield Neural Network With Multi-Bitplane and Multi-Connect Architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1663798/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9077061","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gray Image Recognition Using Hopfield Neural Network With Multi-Bitplane and Multi-Connect Architecture","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"01663798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06405S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11040","isNumber":"34835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34835","articleId":"1663798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1663816,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Feng Liu","id":"37087142524"},{"name":"S.

Their use in creating high-quality rendered images is however still limited. Till date, most renderings of point sampled surfaces use the Phong illumination model. In this paper we consider the rendering of point sampled surfaces with both diffuse and specular material properties under distant illumination, as specified using an environment map. For this, we have combined two of the earlier works for continuous surfaces, spherical harmonic representations of irradiance environment maps and glossy reflection, and programmed it on the GPU using vertex and fragment shaders. This hardware accelerated implementation has been incorporated into a public domain point based renderer enabling us to efficiently produce high quality images of point sampled geometry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Lighting","Computer graphics","Computational geometry","Information geometry","Hardware","Shape","Computer science","Software engineering","Material properties"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","lighting","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environment lighting","point sampled geometry","3D scanning","Phong illumination model","rendering","specular material properties","diffuse material properties","continuous surfaces","spherical harmonic representations","irradiance environment maps","glossy reflection","fragment shaders","vertex shaders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["point based rendering","environment","lighting","spherical harmonics","irradiance","GPU programming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2006.95","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation (CGIV'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation (CGIV'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11040/34835/01663816.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2006.95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Environment Lighting for Point Sampled Geometry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1663816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Environment Lighting for Point Sampled Geometry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1663816/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1663816/","accessionNumber":"9077105","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environment Lighting for Point Sampled Geometry","confLoc":"Sydney, Qld.","sourcePdf":"01663816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04504S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11040","isNumber":"34835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11040","xplore-issue":"34835","articleId":"1663816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1663821,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Mei","affiliation":["LIAMA/NLPR, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xing Mei","id":"37087218627"},{"name":"M.

We propose a stratified sampling scheme for environment maps by first stratifying the maps into a set of rectangular regions with Median Cut method, then estimating the contribution of the regions with Monte Carlo integration techniques. In this way, illumination, surface reflectance and spatial distribution are all taken into consideration for the generation of the light samples. Compared with the existing biased lighting techniques, the presented scheme produces unbiased rendering results with less noise and better shadow boundaries, particularly at low sampling rates. The proposed spatial distribution of the samples also helps to overcome the sampleclumping problem in traditional illumination-based importance sampling method. Experimental results indicate that the scheme is fast, simple to implement and effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1663821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1663821/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9077084","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Effective Stratified Sampling Scheme for Environment Maps with Median Cut Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Stratified Sampling Scheme for Environment Maps with Median Cut Method","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"01663821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049203S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11040","isNumber":"34835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11040","xplore-issue":"34835","articleId":"1663821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1663989,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In the proposed AFNN control system, an FNN with accurate approximation capability is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics of the PMLSM, and a robust compensator is proposed to confront the inevitable approximation errors due to finite number of membership functions and disturbances including the friction force. The adaptive learning algorithm that can learn the parameters of the FNN on line is derived using Lyapunov stability theorem. Moreover, to relax the requirement for the value of lumped uncertainty in the robust compensator, which comprises a minimum approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, higher order terms in Taylor series and friction force, an adaptive lumped uncertainty estimation law is investigated. Furthermore, all the control algorithms are implemented in a TMS320C32 DSP-based control computer. The simulated and experimental results due to periodic reference trajectories show that the dynamic behaviors of the proposed control systems are robust with regard to uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.876744","startPage":"481","endPage":"495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.876744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34847","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/34847/01664884.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control for a DSP-based permanent magnet linear synchronous motor servo drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1664884/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control for a DSP-based permanent magnet linear synchronous motor servo drive","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1664884/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9024911","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control for a DSP-based permanent magnet linear synchronous motor servo drive","sourcePdf":"01664884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120847S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"34847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"34847","articleId":"1664884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1664889,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University of China, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/34847/1664889/1664889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chong Lin (M'02\u2013SM'06) received the B.Sci. and the M.Sci. degrees in applied mathematics from Northeastern University, P.R.

This tool includes a complete tool suite that covers the following three major analog physical designs stages. 1) Module Generation: designers can develop and maintain their own technology- and application-independent module generators for subcircuits using an in-house developed description language. 2) Placement: a two-stage placement technique, tailored for the analog placement design, is proposed. In particular, this placement algorithm features a novel genetic placement stage followed by a fast simulated reannealing scheme. 3) Routing: the minimum-Steiner-tree-based global routing is developed, and it is actually integrated into the placement procedure to improve reliability and routability of the placement solutions. Following the global routing, a compaction-based constructive detailed routing finally completes the interconnection of the entire layout. Several testing circuits have been applied to demonstrate the design efficiency and the effectiveness of this tool. Experimental results show that this new layout tool is capable of producing high quality layouts comparable to those manually done by layout experts but with much less design time","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automated design tool for analog layouts","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2006.878475","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/34848/01664908.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2006.878475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1664908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1664908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"An automated design tool for analog layouts","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1664908/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9024926","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automated design tool for analog layouts","sourcePdf":"01664908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110925S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"34848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"34848","articleId":"1664908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1664910,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Furthermore, communication between SW and HW parts of codesigned applications are typically exposed to SW programmers and HW designers. In this work, we introduce a virtualization layer that allows reconfigurable application-specific coprocessors to access the user-space virtual memory and share the memory address space with user applications. The layer, consisting of an operating system (OS) extension and a HW component, shifts the burden of moving data between processor and coprocessor from the programmer to the OS, lowers the complexity of interfacing, and hides physical details of the system. Not only does the virtualization layer enhance programming abstraction and portability, but it also performs runtime optimizations: by predicting future memory accesses and speculatively prefetching data, the virtualization layer improves the coprocessor execution-applications achieve better performance without any user intervention. We use two different reconfigurable system-on-chip (SoC) running Linux and codesigned applications to prove the viability of our concept. The applications run faster than their SW versions, and the overhead due to the virtualisation is limited. Dynamic prefetching in the virtualisation layer further reduces the abstraction overhead","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1664911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9024929","htmlLink":"/document/1664911/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Virtual memory window for application-specific reconfigurable coprocessors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual memory window for application-specific reconfigurable coprocessors","sourcePdf":"01664911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039802S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"34848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34848","articleId":"1664911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1664912,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

In addition, the DCME architecture using 3t+2 basic cells has regularity and scalability since it uses only one processing element. Hence, the proposed DCME architecture provides the short latency and low-cost RS decoding. The DCME architecture has been synthesized using the 0.25-mum Faraday CMOS standard cell library and operates at 200 MHz. The gate count of the DCME architecture is 21 760.

Using an analytical procedure based on the Hilbert-Huang Technique (HHT), data from transient stability simulations are decomposed into a finite number of time-varying oscillating components that can be associated with different time scales. Hilbert analysis is then utilized to characterize the time evolution of critical components giving rise to the observed oscillations.

This method is based on the combination of time series and fuzzy neural network (FNN). The time series, as a spectrum analyzer, is used to determine the effective input features. The generation adequacy index of loss of energy expectation (LOEE) is selected as the output feature. These input and output features construct the training samples of the FNN.

For wind generation to participate in a short-term energy market, lengthy wind power production forecasts are required.

In this paper, a new method for minimization of imbalance costs is developed. Stochastic programming is used to generate optimal wind power production bids for a short-term power market.

It helps us obtain the most appropriate distributed algorithm for a given network resource allocation problem, and quantifies the comparison across architectural alternatives of modularized network design. Decomposition theory naturally provides the mathematical language to build an analytic foundation for the design of modularized and distributed control of networks. In this tutorial paper, we first review the basics of convexity, Lagrange duality, distributed subgradient method, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterations, and implication of different time scales of variable updates. Then, we introduce primal, dual, indirect, partial, and hierarchical decompositions, focusing on network utility maximization problem formulations and the meanings of primal and dual decompositions in terms of network architectures.

We begin by overviewing important results in the area of opportunistic (channel-aware) scheduling for cellular (single-hop) networks, where easily implementable myopic policies are shown to optimize system performance. We then describe key lessons learned and the main obstacles in extending the work to general resource allocation problems for multihop wireless networks. Towards this end, we show that a clean-slate optimization-based approach to the multihop resource allocation problem naturally results in a \"loosely coupled\" cross-layer solution. That is, the algorithms obtained map to different layers [transport, network, and medium access control/physical (MAC/PHY)] of the protocol stack, and are coupled through a limited amount of information being passed back and forth. It turns out that the optimal scheduling component at the MAC layer is very complex, and thus needs simpler (potentially imperfect) distributed solutions. We demonstrate how to use imperfect scheduling in the cross-layer framework and describe recently developed distributed algorithms along these lines.

A network controller acts on randomly arriving data and makes flow control, routing, and resource allocation decisions to maximize a fairness metric based on a concave utility function of network throughput. A simple set of algorithms are constructed that yield total utility within O(1/V) of the utility-optimal operating point, for any control parameter V>0, with a corresponding end-to-end network delay that grows only logarithmically in V. This is the first algorithm to achieve such \"super-fast\" performance. Furthermore, we show that this is the best utility-delay tradeoff possible.

Recently, network utility maximization has emerged as a powerful framework for studying such cross-layer issues. In this paper, we review and explain three distinct techniques that can be used to engineer utility-maximizing protocols: primal, dual, and cross decomposition. The techniques suggest layered, but loosely coupled, network architectures and protocols where different resource allocation updates should be run at different time-scales. The decomposition methods are applied to the design of fully distributed protocols for two wireless network technologies: networks with orthogonal channels and network-wide resource constraints, as well as wireless networks where the physical layer uses spatial-reuse time-division multiple access.

The problem is considered in the framework of nonlinear optimization. Compared with its counterpart in a wired network where link capacities are fixed, rate control in a multihop random access network is much more complex and requires joint optimization at both the transport and link layers. This is due to the fact that the attainable throughput on each link in the network is \"elastic\" and is typically a nonconvex and nonseparable function of the transmission attempt rates. Two cross-layer algorithms, a dual-based algorithm and a penalty-based algorithm, are proposed in this paper to solve the rate control problem in a multihop random access network. Both algorithms can be implemented in a distributed manner, and work at the link layer to adjust link attempt probabilities and at the transport layer to adjust session rates. We prove rigorously that the two proposed algorithms converge to the globally optimal solutions.

However, in practical situations, the exact CSI may be unavailable because of channel estimation errors and/or outdated training. In this paper, we address the problem of robustness of multiuser MIMO receivers against imperfect CSI and propose a new linear technique that guarantees the robustness against CSI errors with a certain selected probability. The proposed receivers are formulated as probabilistically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Provided that the CSI mismatch is Gaussian, each of these problems is shown to be convex and to have a unique solution. The fact that the CSI mismatch is Gaussian also enables to convert the original stochastic problems to a more tractable deterministic form and to solve them using the second-order cone programming approach. Numerical simulations illustrate an improved robustness of the proposed receivers against CSI errors and validate their better flexibility as compared with the robust multiuser MIMO receivers based on the worst case designs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust linear receivers for multiaccess space-time block-coded MIMO systems: a probabilistically constrained approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.879379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/34851/01665009.pdf","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.879379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34851","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Robust linear receivers for multiaccess space-time block-coded MIMO systems: a probabilistically constrained approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1665009/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9064961","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust linear receivers for multiaccess space-time block-coded MIMO systems: a probabilistically constrained approach","sourcePdf":"01665009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120339S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"34851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"34851","articleId":"1665009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1665011,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

QPS finds a data rate vector such that the expected rate vector over all fading states is proportional to the current queue state vector and is on the boundary of the ergodic capacity region of a fading BC. Utilizing the degradedness of BC for each fading state, QPS is formulated as a geometric program that can be solved with efficient algorithms. The GP formulation of QPS is also extended to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in a fading BC. The throughput optimality of QPS is proved, and it is shown that QPS can arbitrarily scale the ratio of each user's average queueing delay. Throughput, delay, and fairness properties of QPS are numerically evaluated in a fading BC and compared with other scheduling policies such as the well-known maximum weight matching scheduling (MWMS). Simulation results for Poisson packet arrivals and exponentially distributed packet lengths demonstrate that compared with MWMS, QPS provides a significant decrease in average queueing delay and has more desirable fairness properties","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.879404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/34851/01665012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.879404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34851","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queue proportional scheduling via geometric programming in fading broadcast channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Queue proportional scheduling via geometric programming in fading broadcast channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9064964","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1665012/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queue proportional scheduling via geometric programming in fading broadcast channels","sourcePdf":"01665012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075099S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"34851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"34851","articleId":"1665012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1665013,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/34851/1665013/1665013-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Yang (S'02) received the B.E. degree in electronic information engineering from the Radio Department, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2000 and the M.S. degree in optimization and numerical methods from the Singapore-MIT Alliance, National University of Singapore, in 2002.

In particular, the fading multiple-access channel (MAC) and the fading broadcast channel (BC) with additive Gaussian noise and multiple transmit and receive antennas are focused. The fading MAC is considered first and a complete characterization of its capacity region and power region are provided under various power and rate constraints. The derived results can be considered as nontrivial extensions of the work done by Tse and Hanly from the case of single transmit and receive antenna to the more general scenario with multiple transmit and receive antennas. Efficient numerical algorithms are proposed, which demonstrate the usefulness of the convex optimization techniques in characterizing the capacity and power regions.

The effects of non-Gaussian noise are largely unexplored, and it is unclear whether the insights gained and the recommendations with regard to the sizing of strategy parameters that have been made under the assumption of Gaussian noise bear relevance to more general situations. In this paper, the behavior of a powerful class of recombinative evolution strategies is studied on the sphere model under the assumption of a very general noise model. A performance law is derived, its implications are studied both analytically and numerically, and comparisons with the case of Gaussian noise are drawn.

In practice, if the global optimal solution is very sensitive to uncertainties, for example, small changes in design variables or operating conditions, then it may not be appropriate to use this highly sensitive solution. In this paper, we focus on combining evolutionary algorithms with function approximation techniques for robust design. In particular, we investigate the application of robust genetic algorithms to problems with high dimensions. Subsequently, we present a novel evolutionary algorithm based on the combination of a max-min optimization strategy with a Baldwinian trust-region framework employing local surrogate models for reducing the computational cost associated with robust design problems. Empirical results are presented for synthetic test functions and aerodynamic shape design problems to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges to robust optimum designs on a limited computational budget.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2005.859464","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/34852/01665029.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2005.859464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Max-min surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for robust design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Max-min surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for robust design","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9019733","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1665029/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Max-min surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for robust design","sourcePdf":"01665029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121677S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"34852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"34852","articleId":"1665029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1665030,"authors":[{"name":"I.

By robustness, we mean that small deviations from the original design, e.g., due to manufacturing tolerances, should be tolerated without a severe loss of quality. One way to achieve that goal is to evaluate each solution under a number of different scenarios and use the average solution quality as fitness. However, this approach is often impractical, because the cost for evaluating each individual several times is unacceptable. In this paper, we present a new and efficient approach to estimating a solution's expected quality and variance. We propose to construct local approximate models of the fitness function and then use these approximate models to estimate expected fitness and variance. Based on a variety of test functions, we demonstrate empirically that our approach significantly outperforms the implicit averaging approach, as well as the explicit averaging approaches using existing estimation techniques reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2005.859465","startPage":"405","endPage":"420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/34852/01665030.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2005.859465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient search for robust solutions by means of evolutionary algorithms and fitness approximation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Evolutionary computation","Job shop scheduling","Turbines","Costs","Testing","Uncertainty","Manufacturing processes","Electric breakdown","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","approximation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary algorithms","fitness approximation","approximate models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary optimization","fitness approximation","robustness","uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Efficient search for robust solutions by means of evolutionary algorithms and fitness approximation","volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1665030/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9019734","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient search for robust solutions by means of evolutionary algorithms and fitness approximation","sourcePdf":"01665030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12596S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"34852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"34852","articleId":"1665030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1665031,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.M.

Most vulnerable plaques consist of a thin fibrous cap covering an atheromous core. These plaques can be identified using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) palpography, which measures radial strain by cross-correlating RF signals at different intraluminal pressures. Multiple strain images (i.e., partial palpograms) are averaged per heart cycle to produce a more robust compounded palpogram. However, catheter motion due to cardiac activity causes misalignment of the RF signals and thus of the partial palpograms, resulting in less valid strain estimates. To compensate for in-plane catheter rotation and translation, we devised four methods based on block matching. The global rotation block matching (GRBM) and contour mapping (CMAP) methods measure catheter rotation, and local block matching (LBM) and catheter rotation and translation (CRT) estimate displacements of local tissue regions. These methods were applied to nine in vivo pullback acquisitions, made with a 20 MHz phased-array transducer. We found that all these methods significantly increase the number of valid strain estimates in the partial and compounded palpograms (P < 0.008).

Models have been developed using finite element methods and Field II, a linear acoustic field simulation package, to study the impact of focal configuration, tracking frequency, and material properties on the accuracy of ultrasonically tracking the tissue deformation generated by acoustic radiation force excitations. These models demonstrate that lateral and elevation shearing underneath the PSF of the tracking beam leads to displacement underestimation in the focal zone. Displacement underestimation can be reduced by using tracking beams that are narrower than the spatial extent of the displacement fields. Displacement underestimation and jitter decrease with time after excitation as shear wave propagation away from the region of excitation reduces shearing in the lateral and elevation dimensions. The use of higher tracking frequencies in broadband transducers, along with 2D focusing in the elevation dimension, will reduce jitter and improve displacement tracking accuracy. Relative displacement underestimation remains constant as a function of applied force, whereas jitter increases with applied force. Underdeveloped speckle (SNR < 1.91) leads to greater levels of jitter and peak displacement underestimation. Axial shearing is minimal over the tracking kernel lengths used in acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and thus does not impact displacement tracking.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1665078/","pubMedId":"16889337","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic tracking of acoustic radiation force-induced displacements in homogeneous media","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic tracking of acoustic radiation force-induced displacements in homogeneous media","sourcePdf":"01665078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085638S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"34855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"34855","articleId":"1665078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":1665085,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Guyomar","affiliation":["Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Electrique et de F\u00e9rro\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (LGEF), INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/34855/1665085/1665085-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Guyomar received a degree in physics from Amiens University, Amiens, France, an engineering and a Doctor-engineer degree in acoustics from Compiegne University, Compiegne, France, and a Ph.D. degree in physics from Paris VII University, Paris, France.","In 1982\u20131983 he worked as a research associate in fluid dynamics at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.

In this field, electromagnetic transformers may be replaced with significant benefit by piezoelectric transformers (PT). In a PT, the input electrical energy is transferred to the output by an acoustical means, using the direct and converse effects of piezoelectric materials. Its main advantages over an electromagnetic transformer are no magnetic noise generation, small size, high power density, and high efficiency. This paper deals with an innovative technique that produces a significant improvement of the power capability of piezoelectric transformers. This technique is based on a particular output voltage processing of the PT. Its effect is a vibration level reduction of the PT structure while keeping the output power practically constant. Vibration level is a critical parameter that determines the maximum power capability of a given PT. Thus, the new processing reduces significantly the losses of the PT. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results show that the increase of the power capability may reach 200%.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1665085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/34855/01665085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1665085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34855","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear processing of the output voltage a piezoelectric transformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear processing of the output voltage a piezoelectric transformer","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","pubMedId":"16889344","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1665085/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear processing of the output voltage a piezoelectric transformer","sourcePdf":"01665085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077163S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"34855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"34855","articleId":"1665085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1665100,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

Because of the high spatial frequency content of aberrators, 2-D arrays, which generally have smaller pitch and thus higher spatial sampling frequency, and 3-D imaging show potential to improve the performance of adaptive imaging. Phase-correction algorithms improve image quality by compensating for tissue-induced errors in beamforming. Using the illustrative example of transcranial ultrasound, we have evaluated our ability to perform adaptive imaging with a real-time, 3-D scanner. We have used a polymer casting of a human temporal bone, root-mean-square (RMS) phase variation of 45.0 ns, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) correlation length of 3.35 mm, and an electronic aberrator, 100 ns RMS, 3.76 mm correlation, with tissue phantoms as illustrative examples of near-field, phase-screen aberrators. Using the multilag, least-squares, cross-correlation method, we have shown the ability of 3-D adaptive imaging to increase anechoic cyst identification, image brightness, contrast-to-speckle ratio (CSR), and, in 3-D color Doppler experiments, the ability to visualize flow.

CMUTs are conventionally operated by applying a direct current (DC) bias voltage less than the collapse voltage of the membrane, so that the membrane is deflected toward the bottom electrode. In the conventional regime, there is no contact between the membrane and the substrate; the maximum alternating current (AC) displacement occurs at the center of the membrane. In collapse-mode operation, the DC bias voltage is first increased beyond the collapse voltage, then reduced without releasing the collapsed membrane. In collapse-mode operation, the center of the membrane is always in contact with the substrate. In the case of a circular membrane, the maximum AC displacement occurs along the ring formed between the center and the edge of the membrane. The experimental characterization presented in this paper includes impedance measurements in air, pulse-echo experiments in immersion, and one-way optical displacement measurements in immersion for both conventional and collapse-mode operations. A 205-mum times 205-mum 2-D CMUT array element composed of circular silicon nitride membranes is used in the experiments. In pulse-echo experiments, a custom integrated circuit (IC) comprising a pulse driver, a transmit/receive switch, a wideband low-noise preamplifier, and a line driver is used. By reducing the parasitic capacitance, the use of a custom IC enables pulse-echo measurements at high frequencies with a very small transducer. By comparing frequency response and efficiency of the transducer in conventional and collapse regimes, experimental results show that a collapsed membrane can be used to generate and detect ultrasound more efficiently than a membrane operated in the conventional mode. Furthermore, the center frequency of the collapsed membrane can be changed by varying the applied DC voltage. In this study, the center frequency of a collapsed transducer in immersion is shown to vary from 20 MHz to 28 MHz with applied DC bias; the same transducer operates at 10 MHz in the conventional mode. In conventional mode, the maximum peak-to-peak pressure is 370 kPa on the transducer surface for a 40-ns, 25-V unipolar pulse excitation. In collapse mode, a 25-ns, 25-V unipolar pulse generates 590 kPa pressure at the surface of the transducer","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1665109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34856","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/34856/01665109.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental characterization of collapse-mode CMUT operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1665109/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Experimental characterization of collapse-mode CMUT operation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9022765","pubMedId":"16921904","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental characterization of collapse-mode CMUT operation","sourcePdf":"01665109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082364S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"34856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"34856","articleId":"1665109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1665115,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Further, since the control software runs in every router, managing a large network of routers is complex and expensive. In this paper, we propose that the control software be hosted in a few control element servers remotely from the forwarding elements (routers). This reduces the software complexity in numerous forwarding elements, thus increasing the overall reliability of the network. In order to achieve this, we describe the design and implementation of two protocols: 1) Dyna-BIND that allows the forwarding elements to dynamically bind to control elements and 2) ForCES that allows the control elements to control the forwarding elements. Furthermore, we argue using several examples that the separation and logical centralization of control plane software in this architecture enables easier deployment of new services","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separating Control Software from Routers","publicationTitle":"2006 1st International Conference on Communication Systems Software & Middleware","doi":"10.1109/COMSWA.2006.1665183","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st International Conference on Communication Systems Software & Middleware","pdfPath":"/iel5/11046/34859/01665183.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSWA.2006.1665183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Separating Control Software from Routers","conferenceDate":"8-12 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665183/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9076028","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separating Control Software from Routers","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"01665183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094736S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11046","isNumber":"34859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11046","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"34859","articleId":"1665183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1665213,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Reliability is affected by the harsh environmental conditions, interferences in wireless medium and usage of low quality sensors. Due to these conditions, the data generated by the sensors may get corrupted resulting in outliers and missing values. Deciding whether an observation is an outlier or not depends on the behavior of the neighbors' readings as well as the readings of the sensor itself. This can be done by capturing the spatio-temporal correlations that exists among the observations of the sensor nodes. By using naive Bayesian networks for classification, we can estimate whether an observation belongs to a class or not. If it falls beyond the range of the class, then it can be detected as an outlier. However naive Bayesian networks do not consider the conditional dependencies among the observations of sensor attributes. So, we propose an outlier detection scheme based on Bayesian belief networks, which captures the conditional dependencies among the observations of the attributes to detect the outliers in the sensor streamed data. Applicability of this scheme as a plug-in to the component oriented middleware for sensor networks (COMiS) of our early research work is also presented","doi":"10.1109/COMSWA.2006.1665221","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st International Conference on Communication Systems Software & Middleware","pdfPath":"/iel5/11046/34859/01665221.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSWA.2006.1665221","publicationTitle":"2006 1st International Conference on Communication Systems Software & Middleware","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outlier Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks using Bayesian Belief Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Outlier Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks using Bayesian Belief Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665221/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9076065","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","conferenceDate":"8-12 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outlier Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks using Bayesian Belief Networks","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"01665221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065067S","chronDate":"8-12 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11046","isNumber":"34859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11046","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"34859","articleId":"1665221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1665239,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Whereas today either command-and-control licensing, or alternatively unlicensed bands are used to coordinate the radio spectrum utilization, it is envisioned to coordinate the spectrum utilization in a more flexible way with the help of dynamic spectrum assignment. With this new approach, radio systems will share spectrum either horizontally with distributed spectrum allocation such as listen-before-talk and equal rights to access the radio spectrum, or vertically, where so-called primary radio systems have higher priority to access the radio spectrum than the so-called secondary radio systems. Horizontal and vertical spectrum sharing are often discussed in the context of opportunistic spectrum usage and cognitive (secondary) radio. To guarantee the spectrum access priorities when spectrum is shared, and to coordinate the vertical spectrum sharing between primary and cognitive radio systems, beaconing concepts are often proposed but criticized for their poor reliability in hidden station scenarios. In this paper, we discuss an improved beaconing concept that is based on operator assistance with two instead of one single beacon. Our analysis illustrates that our proposed dual beacon concept provides high flexibility and at the same time improves the reliability of spectrum coordination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665239/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9076083","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"8-12 Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665239/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Operator Assisted Cognitive Radio and Dynamic Spectrum Assignment with Dual Beacons - Detailed Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operator Assisted Cognitive Radio and Dynamic Spectrum Assignment with Dual Beacons - Detailed Evaluation","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"01665239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063094S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11046","isNumber":"34859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11046","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"34859","articleId":"1665239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1665299,"authors":[{"name":"Dian-chun Zheng","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronic Engineering College, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Dian-chun Zheng","id":"37087686126"},{"name":"Chun-xi Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronic Engineering College, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Chun-xi Zhang","id":"37087686678"},{"name":"Guo-qing Yang","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronic Engineering College, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Guo-qing Yang","id":"37087687799"},{"name":"Xue-yong Sun","affiliation":["Jiangxi Electric Power Design Institute, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"lastName":"Xue-yong Sun","id":"37087688448"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0333-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-084X"}],"articleNumber":"1665299","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Wavelet analysis","Artificial neural networks","Wavelet domain","Pulse measurements","Signal analysis","Time domain analysis","Fault location"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharges","feature extraction","pattern classification","signal classification","signal sources","signal denoising","power engineering computing","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","wavelet transforms","time-frequency analysis","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge patterns","pattern recognition","wavelet neural network","time-frequency characteristics","temporal-scaling approach","network learning","power spectrum analysis","displacement factor","feature extraction","BP neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["partial discharge","wavelet neural network","pattern recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665299","abstract":"Considering the time-frequency characteristic of the partial discharge (PD) signals, the kind of improved wavelet neural network is constructed by principle of the temporal-scaling approach, and it is that using temporal-scaling domain of the wavelet basis function being chosen covers that of the partial discharge signals.

The integer multiple frequency is used as a sampling signal for all signal processing/filtering blocks within the MPLL. The bandpass filter ensures that the MPLL is robust against disturbances that appear on the power system.

Such multiphase motor drives are nowadays considered for various applications. Multiphase drives are invariably supplied from multiphase voltage source inverters (VSIs) and adequate methods for VSI pulse width modulation (PWM) are therefore required. This paper analyses different space vector PWM (SVPWM) schemes for a five-phase VSI, which can be used for five-phase motor drives. A detailed model of a five-phase VSI is presented first in terms of space vectors. Next, the existing technique of utilising only large space vectors is elaborated. It is shown that this SVPWM method leads to generation of high amounts of low-order output voltage harmonics. Finally, a novel SVPWM method is introduced, which enables operation with pure sinusoidal output voltages up to a certain reference voltage value, which is smaller than the maximum achievable with the given DC link voltage. To enable full utilisation of the DC bus voltage, this SVPWM scheme is complemented with another one, which unavoidably does lead to generation of some low order harmonics. These harmonics are however of significantly lower values than when only large vectors are used. A detailed performance evaluation of the existing and newly developed schemes is done and it is presented in terms of quality of the output voltage waveforms. Simulation results are included throughout the paper to illustrate and verify the theoretical considerations","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2005.219194","publicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11048/34861/01665384.pdf","startPage":"12 pp.","endPage":"P.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2005.219194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space vector modulation schemes for a five-phase voltage source inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665384/","displayDocTitle":"Space vector modulation schemes for a five-phase voltage source inverter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9035837","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665384/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space vector modulation schemes for a five-phase voltage source inverter","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01665384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044987S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"11048","isNumber":"34861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11048","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"34861","articleId":"1665384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1665415,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The PMSM rotor position and speed is acquired using sliding-mode rotor flux observer. Observer is based on the model of the PMSM where the derivation of the estimated stator flux is calculated from measured stator voltage and current. When implementing a multiple-loop control of a drive on a single processor, most of the computational time is devoted to the inner current-control loop calculation and generation of output voltage vectors in order to obtain proper drive current signal. The speed of the current controller and modulator is therefore essential for the performance of the control. Major attention is paid to current control constructed as direct current control using event-driven approach and implemented on FPGA. Event-driving determines the transistor switching pattern directly from the current error logic signals change and is designed using a novel matrix based description of the discrete event systems. It is based on matrix description of Petri nets, supplemented with a combination of logic and algebraic equations and introduces a kind of state-space description for discrete event systems. The control algorithms designed by proposed approach can be easily implemented on modern FPGA devices, which enable parallel execution of the calculations, comparing to the traditional sequential executions on the DSPs. Instead of traditional coding, the control algorithms are loaded in the form of logical matrices. The approach is utilized for torque/speed control based on the sliding mode rotor flux observer. The results of computer simulations are presented as well as the experimental hardware setup","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speed sensorless control of PM synchronous machine using direct current control","publicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2005.219310","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11048/34861/01665500.pdf","startPage":"10 pp.","endPage":"P.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2005.219310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Speed sensorless control of PM synchronous machine using direct current control","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665500/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9073951","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speed sensorless control of PM synchronous machine using direct current control","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01665500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090621S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"11048","isNumber":"34861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11048","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34861","articleId":"1665500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1665505,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In induction wind generators, unbalanced three-phase stator voltages cause a number of problems, such as overheating, over-current, and stress on the mechanical components from torque pulsations. Therefore, beyond a certain amount of unbalance, induction wind generators are switched out of the network. This can further weaken the grid. In doubly-fed induction generators, control of rotor currents allows for adjustable speed operation and reactive power control. In addition, it is possible to control the rotor currents to correct for the problems caused by unbalanced stator voltages, including torque pulsations and unbalanced stator currents. This paper presents a novel voltage mode controller design for a doubly-fed induction generator that provides variable speed, reactive power control.

Strategies based on this principle fulfil nearly all demands of drive technology today. Due to its basic ideas, the performance of field oriented control cannot be improved without limitations. Furthermore, linear controllers always produce a continuously valued output. Hence, for controlling an inverter additional components, which discretise the output of the controller, have to be inserted. Predictive controllers, which allow to overcome this drawback, are known in drive control for quite a long time. Nevertheless all predictive control schemes proposed for controlling electrical drives until today only precalculate the system behaviour for one single future sampling cycle. Powerful control strategies like model predictive control, well-known in chemical engineering, allow higher prediction horizons, but these strategies have not yet been used for drive control. This paper proposes a new predictive controller for electrical drives based on model predictive control, which allows optimal control of the inverter directly, i.e. without using any kind of modulator. In contrast to all predictive strategies published so far for drive control, the new controller optimises the control action not only for the next sampling period, but for a longer prediction horizon","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct model predictive control - a new direct predictive control strategy for electrical drives","publicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2005.219335","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11048/34861/01665525.pdf","startPage":"10 pp.","endPage":"P.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2005.219335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1665525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Direct model predictive control - a new direct predictive control strategy for electrical drives","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665525/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9035916","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct model predictive control - a new direct predictive control strategy for electrical drives","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01665525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051771S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"11048","isNumber":"34861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11048","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"34861","articleId":"1665525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1665539,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Minimization of losses and regulation of neutral point voltage (NPV) of this converter are the objects aimed in this paper. The converter losses and variations of NPV are measured from the simulation results for possible switching patterns of space vector modulation (SVM). IGBTs with linear fall and tail current model are selected as power switches of converter. Through a comparative study among the converter losses and variations of NPV resulted from the all-possible switching sequences of three level SVM, it is shown that a unique switching algorithm cannot minimize both the switching losses and variations of NPV. Therefore the paper proposes a sub-optimized switching algorithm resulting in very satisfactory conditions for the converter from the viewpoint of losses and of variations of NPV. Using this switching algorithm, the converter losses and variations of NPV reach either to their minimum or to a value near their minimum","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2005.219362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2005.219362","startPage":"9 pp.","endPage":"P.9","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11048/34861/01665552.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized selection of switching algorithm in space vector modulated neutral point clamped converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Optimized selection of switching algorithm in space vector modulated neutral point clamped converters","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665552/","accessionNumber":"9073955","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665552/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized selection of switching algorithm in space vector modulated neutral point clamped converters","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01665552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059102S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"11048","isNumber":"34861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11048","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34861","articleId":"1665552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1665584,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Fuel cells for a residential application, with combined heat and power (CHP), may offer a viable energy source when both thermal and electrical outputs are associated with energy storage. The addition of grid connection improves reliability and offers the option to sell surplus energy when economically justified. A fuel cell has a variable, low voltage dc output requiring a power electronic interface to any energy storage and to ac loads. A simple inverter topology can be adopted based on minimum component count. This paper presents the design, simulation and experimental verification of an economic arrangement utilising an intermediate voltage storage battery and a bidirectional dc/ac interface suitable for domestic ac loads and grid synchronisation. The design was modelled in Matlab/Simulink. An economic model of the fuel cell/battery/grid system, operating in micro-CHP mode, was developed to assess the prospects for commercial exploitation and to characterise the relationship between domestic load profile, fuel cell rating and battery capacity to optimize life time cost. This model assumes natural gas for the fuel cell, as hydrogen infrastructure is not yet available.

Therefore fault diagnosis of voltage source inverters is becoming more and more important. One possible fault within the inverter is an open circuit transistor fault. An overview of the different strategies to detect this fault is given, including the algorithms used to localize the open transistor. Previous work showed significant differences among the available methods to detect such a fault for a mains side active rectifier. This paper extends the performance evaluation for the inverter connected to the machine with variable stator voltage and frequency. Simulation results are presented.

As a result, the power quality i.e. the reliability of the energy supply and the quality of the voltage waveform, may be severely degraded. Especially in the case of resonances, severe voltage distortion can be the result. Both harmonic voltage and current distortion may cause many unfavourable effects on both the power system and the connected loads. Although complete compensation is only possible using true active filters, resistive shunt harmonic impedances (SHI) have been shown to provide a considerable reduction of the harmonic distortion. These impedances can be implemented using active power electronic devices which are controlled to synthesize a resistive load. Benefits are: no need to measure the polluting current of non-linear loads, effective for all harmonics and different resonance conditions, simple control strategy, and possible implementation as a secondary control function of active power supplies and distributed power inverters. In this paper, a practical implementation of a resistive SHI is proposed. A new control strategy for a full-bridge ac-dc converter has been implemented in order to achieve a programmable resistive input impedance for harmonics, independent of the input impedance for the fundamental component. The potential to damp a resonance in a power distribution system is demonstrated using an experimental setup. Providing extra damping into the power system is an interesting feature for power electronic loads as well as for converters used in distributed power generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1665693/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9036022","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adding damping in power distribution systems by means of power electronic converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adding damping in power distribution systems by means of power electronic converters","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01665693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070313S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"11048","isNumber":"34861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11048","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34861","articleId":"1665693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1665713,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A model of the motor losses allows the NN to calculate the flux for a maximum efficiency in each working point of the induction motor (IM). Taking into consideration the fact that nominal flux is not necessary for load torques below the rated torque of the IM, losses can be transferred from iron to copper decreasing the real flux and reaching the minimum total losses point. A complex loss model of the motor, including magnetic and thermal deviations of its parameters, is used to estimate losses. This can be useful in many applications where induction motors work below the nominal torque most of the time. To account for iron and copper losses, some inductances and resistances of the IM must be computed. Estimators are implemented for this purpose. Changes in resistance values due to temperature and in inductances due to iron saturation curves are also computed. Algorithms for computing the optimum flux with NN and vector control with this optimum flux were implemented in a DS1102 controller board from DSpace. In the sub-system for flux computation the neural network is trained to estimate the optimum rotor flux. Inputs to the NN are torque, speed and estimated rotor resistance of the IM and the output is the rotor flux.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665752/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9036058","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665752/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient energy controller for an induction motor drive with compensation of temperature using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient energy controller for an induction motor drive with compensation of temperature using neural networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01665752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063184S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"11048","isNumber":"34861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11048","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34861","articleId":"1665752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1665760,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

Moreover it is very reliable because experimentally tests each possible solution, consequently the final result is not affected by the accuracy of the motor model. Finally, the proposed on-line hybrid optimization can be embedded as a fully-automated tool without any extra-hardware on industrial drives.

It ensures that a simulation presents the same behavior as the real system, providing a useful instrument for control design. Consequently, the designer would avoid wasting time manually adjusting parameters of controllers which have achieved good performance in simulation but poor performance in the real system. However, the evaluation of the actual plant parameters is always a hard job for the designer due to the mismatch between rated and actual values and the presence of unmodelled dynamics. This paper presents a technique for the optimization of the parameters of the simulation model of a shunt active power filter system using genetic algorithms (GAs). The optimization process is based on experimental data measured during the normal operation of the real system. After this, the identified model has been used to optimize in simulation the controllers of the shunt active power filter. Experimental results prove that the optimized controllers greatly improve the system performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1665907/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9074036","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1665907/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modelling and design of shunt active power filters using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and design of shunt active power filters using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01665907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061813S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"11048","isNumber":"34861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11048","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"34861","articleId":"1665907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1665952,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Subsequently, particle physics made dramatic progress in the understanding of the fundamental forces and particles, and underlying symmetries of nature. These achievements were based on intensive interaction between the development of powerful theories, experimental discoveries and precision measurements with particle accelerators. Power converters play a crucial role in accelerators and the evolution of power electronics is one of the important ingredients that has allowed the attainable energy to be increased by a large factor every decade. This exponential growth has enabled physicists to resolve ever smaller objects and to produce ever heavier particles. For every new generation of accelerators, improvements in beam quality impose new and more severe requirements on power converter performance. In response, a more diverse set of converter ratings and topologies are necessary; from watts to megawatts and from pulsed to DC. This paper highlights specific power converter applications that illustrate the evolution of power electronics used in particle accelerators.

To improve bulky and heavy structure of CRT, FPDs have been developed and are now available in the market. LCDs created various applications of displays, because of its size variation and high-resolution capability. It is essential to understand the operational principle of the display in order to meet the needs. The need of high image quality is increasing and the demand of portability is also increasing as visual information is provided in various media other than TV broadcasting. It is important to optimize the display specifications according to its application. There is a trend of adding new value to the display such as integrating input function and flexibility.

In cardiology, the heart's shape and motion are visualized in addition to the blood's flow pattern. In radiology, various tumors, inflammatory diseases and other malignancies can be detected. Ultrasound is the best-suited diagnostic modality to visualize homodynamics in organs and the vascular system. An ultrasound image is acquired by launching acoustic waves and receiving echoes that are reflected from cell boundaries. The role of power electronics in medical ultrasound arises from the specific requirements of launching the acoustic waves. The waves are generated with transducers made of ferroelectric material. The transducer is electrically excited and the ferroelectric material creates a vibration that couples as a wave into the human body. Generating this electrical waveform poses a substantial challenge. The electrical load impedance is typically highly capacitive and drive signals of several hundred volts are required to generate the necessary acoustic pressure. Further, the introduction of 2D arrays requires that several thousand parallel drive circuits be placed in a space of only a few cubic centimeters. An efficient implementation of the drive circuitry is essential to the progress of ultrasound imaging. Depending on the application either signal switches, bior tri-level pulse generation circuits or high voltage linear drivers are required. This talk derives the need for more advanced and higher integrated power electronics to transmit the ultrasound waves. It further focuses on the pulser's particular requirements stemming from the ultrasound application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Medical diagnostic imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Biomedical imaging","Visualization","Acoustic waves","Power electronics","Biomedical transducers","Acoustic transducers","Ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","driver circuits","power integrated circuits","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power drive circuits","diagnostic medical ultrasound","acoustic waves","electrical waveform","electrical load impedance","acoustic pressure","2D arrays","parallel drive circuits","ultrasound imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPSD.2006.1666054","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and IC's","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and IC's","pdfPath":"/iel5/11050/34863/01666054.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPSD.2006.1666054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Drive Circuits for Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1666054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Drive Circuits for Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1666054/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1666054/","accessionNumber":"9085804","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Drive Circuits for Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"01666054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048809S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11050","isNumber":"34863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11050","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"34863","articleId":"1666054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1666080,"authors":[{"name":"A.

High voltages, thermionic, life limited emitters operating in a high vacuum enclosure contribute to the TWTA risks and reliability questions. Conventional wisdom espouses the SSPA as an inherently more reliable, solid-state device requiring only low voltages to amplify, with failure resulting in only graceful degradation. However, many trade studies on comparing SSPAs and TWTAs rely on transistor device life test data on the ground for SSPAs due to lack of statistically significant data on orbit. It is expected that current, on-orbit statistics in the industry would shed relevant light on the debate.","doi":"10.1109/IVELEC.2006.1666184","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Vacuum Electronics Conference held Jointly with 2006 IEEE International Vacuum Electron Sources","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Vacuum Electronics Conference held Jointly with 2006 IEEE International Vacuum Electron Sources","pdfPath":"/iel5/11051/34864/01666184.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVELEC.2006.1666184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"TWTA versus SSPA: A New Look at Boeing Fleet On-Orbit Reliability Data and Comparison Factors","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1666184/","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9143095","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1666184/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TWTA versus SSPA: A New Look at Boeing Fleet On-Orbit Reliability Data and Comparison Factors","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01666184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033324S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11051","isNumber":"34864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11051","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34864","articleId":"1666184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1666247,"authors":[{"name":"Won Bum Seo","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Won Bum Seo","id":"37087695443"},{"name":"Hae Jin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hae Jin Kim","id":"37087254506"},{"name":"Ji Han Joo","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ji Han Joo","id":"37087169389"},{"name":"Jin Joo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Joo Choi","id":"37087157659"},{"name":"Joon Ho So","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea","Agency for Defence Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joon Ho So","id":"37087182563"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0108-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1666247","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1666247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrication","Circuit simulation","Predictive models","Coupling circuits","Broadband amplifiers","Circuit testing","Wideband","Impedance","Frequency","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave amplifiers","microwave tubes","travelling wave amplifiers","travelling wave tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Helix-TWT","MPM","AM/AM","AM/PM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Helix-TWT","MPM","AM/AM","AM/PM"]}],"abstract":"The vaned helix TWT for MPM application is designed, fabricated and tested to develop a wideband microwave source.

Our analysis is based on a simple star network where there is no multicast and network coding can only be applied at the peers. Under the idealized assumption that there is perfect information to realize optimal routing, this model captures the essential elements of a P2P network, yet allows simple analysis for what can be achieved by network coding and by routing respectively. The conclusion is that there is no coding advantage. We then discuss the applicability of this result to a real P2P content distribution system which may operate at lower throughput due to various other factors.

According to this concept, DiffSeg system, where the two-dimensional resource domain of OFDM is filled with four different resource units, called segments, and the occupancy ratio of each type of segment is determined by the segment map, has been recently proposed in [5][6]. In this paper, we introduce a concept of segment diversion to utilize the radio resource more efficiently considering the status of QoS. We then propose a system optimization model, which finds an optimal segment map and diversion ratios of real-time (RT) connections in order to maximize the residual resource for non-real-time (NRT) traffic while satisfying the minimum QoS requirement of RT traffic. We formulate an optimization problem using mixed integer programming, and then develop two computationally efficient algorithms: simplex-based heuristic and Maximum Diversion Rule. Especially, Maximum Diversion Rule is shown to achieve a near-optimal solution with dramatically less complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666449","publicationTitle":"2006 4th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 4th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11052/34865/01666449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34865","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connection-Level QoS Provisioning in Multiple Transmission Technology-based OFDM System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1666449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Connection-Level QoS Provisioning in Multiple Transmission Technology-based OFDM System","chronOrPublicationDate":"03-06 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1666449/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 Feb.-2 March 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1666449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connection-Level QoS Provisioning in Multiple Transmission Technology-based OFDM System","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"01666449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050189S","chronDate":"03-06 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11052","isNumber":"34865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11052","xplore-issue":"34865","articleId":"1666449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1666455,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Ying","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Lei Ying","id":"37087268774"},{"name":"R.

In this paper, we consider opportunistic splitting algorithms, where a sequence of mini-slots is used to determine the appropriate user to schedule at each time. In prior work, this type of algorithm has been developed for homogeneous systems in which all users have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel statistics. Here, we specify new splitting algorithms for a heterogeneous environment that may also include fairness constraints. The performance of the splitting algorithms are characterized via analysis and simulations. In particular, we show that in certain cases, a heterogeneous algorithm will perform at least as well as the homogeneous algorithm in a system with the same total number of users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1666459/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"03-06 April 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1666459/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 Feb.-2 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Splitting Algorithms for Wireless Networks with Fairness Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Splitting Algorithms for Wireless Networks with Fairness Constraints","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"01666459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054944S","chronDate":"03-06 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11052","isNumber":"34865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11052","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"34865","articleId":"1666459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1666470,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.

It was shown that a scheme based on Dirty Paper Coding [2] achieves the full capacity region when the transmitter has perfect channel state information. However, this scheme potentially involves considerable amounts of feedback and complex algorithms for coding and user selection. This has led to a quest for practical transmission schemes and ways to reduce the amount of channel state information required. In particular, it has been shown that when the total number of users is large, the sum capacity can be closely approached by transmitting to a small subset of near-orthogonal users. In order to further quantify the latter observation, we study a Gaussian broadcast channel with two transmit antennas and K statistically identical, independent users each with a single receive antenna. We obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the gap between the full sum capacity and the rate that can be achieved by transmitting to a suitably selected pair of users. Specifically, we consider various simple schemes for user-pair selection that take into account the channel norms as well as the relative orientation of the channel vectors. We conclude that a scheme that picks the strongest user and selects a second user to form the best pair, is asymptotically optimal, while also being attractive in terms of feedback and operational complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Channel state information","Broadcasting","Feedback","Transmitters","Laboratories","Broadcast technology","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Antenna arrays"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666470","publicationTitle":"2006 4th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 4th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11052/34865/01666470.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Scheduling of Multi-User Multi-Antenna Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1666470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Scheduling of Multi-User Multi-Antenna Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1666470/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1666470/","conferenceDate":"26 Feb.-2 March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"03-06 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Scheduling of Multi-User Multi-Antenna Systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"01666470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073164S","chronDate":"03-06 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11052","isNumber":"34865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11052","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"34865","articleId":"1666470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1666478,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Moreover, some applications may require the deployment of multiple sniffers to monitor the numerous channels in an 802.11 network. In this paper, we explore sampling strategies for monitoring multiple channels in 802.11b/g networks. We describe a simple sampling strategy, where each channel is observed for an equal, predetermined length of time, and consider applications where such a strategy might be appropriate. We then introduce a sampling strategy that weights the time spent on each channel according to the number of frames observed on that channel, and compare the two strategies under experimental conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1666486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"03-06 April 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 Feb.-2 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1666486/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel Sampling Strategies for Monitoring Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Sampling Strategies for Monitoring Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"01666486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046833S","chronDate":"03-06 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11052","isNumber":"34865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11052","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"34865","articleId":"1666486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1666494,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-jen Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-jen Hsu","id":"37087332742"},{"name":"A.

Employing dynamic reuse of spectral resources, we impose a peak power constraint at each base station and allow for coordination between the base stations. By an analytical derivation we find that the optimal power allocation then has a remarkably simple nature: Depending on the noise and channel gains, transmit at full power only at base station 1 or base station 2, or both. Utilizing the optimal power allocation we study optimal link adaptation, and compare to adaptive transmission without power control. Results show that allowing for power control significantly increases the overall capacity for an average user pair, in addition to considerable power savings. Furthermore, we investigate power adaptation in combination with scheduling of users in a time slotted system. Specifically, the capacity-optimal single-cell scheduler [1] is generalized to the two-cell case.

Ghosh et al., 2005) wireless network standards and is being evaluated for fourth generation (4G) networks such as those being proposed in the 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards bodies. Its tolerance to frequency selective fading has made it an attractive choice for these broadband wireless networks. In both downlink and uplink directions, resources can be allocated in three dimensions, frequency, time and power. In both cases the resource allocation is performed primarily by the basestation (BS). In this paper we focus on the allocation of downlink resources when such a network is used for quality of service (QoS) applications. Using a utility function framework, we formulate and solve the corresponding optimization problem and use the optimality conditions to design simple, practical algorithms. In doing so we take into account practical details that have not been addressed in previous work","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2006.1666553","publicationTitle":"2006 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/11053/34866/01666553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2006.1666553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34866","startPage":"5 pp.","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive subchannel allocation in an OFDMA-based wireless network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1666553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive subchannel allocation in an OFDMA-based wireless network","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1666553/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 April 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9074529","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1666553/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive subchannel allocation in an OFDMA-based wireless network","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"01666553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045227S","chronDate":"11-13 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11053","isNumber":"34866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11053","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"34866","articleId":"1666553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1666578,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Wang","id":"37538912600"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xin Zhang","id":"37291970600"},{"name":"Yongyu Chang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yongyu Chang","id":"37292169600"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dacheng Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0340-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"1666578","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Control systems","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Quality of service","Throughput","Delay","Telecommunication congestion control","Telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","cellular radio","code division multiple access","quality of service","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive congestion control scheme","CDMA cellular systems","base station algorithm","mobile algorithm","best-effort data","system throughput","quality of service"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an adaptive congestion control scheme that consists of base station algorithm and mobile algorithm.

We consider Bose, Chaudhuri and Hoquenghem (BCH) codes with different codeword lengths and error correction capabilities. In contrast with previous works, that implement coding algorithm in hardware and consequently used hardware energy profiling, in this work we consider a more realistic assumption that the node's mu-processor performs coding and energy consumption of decoding is measured using JouleTrack. Energy efficiency is used as the performance metric for communication and the interaction of multi-hop communication and coding is investigated. Simulation results show that communicating long packets is more energy efficient. If communication is multi-hop with sufficient number of hops, then, the uncoded system is beneficial.

The new method then described consists (for continuous wave reception) of the following steps:- 1. Heterodyning, with the production of a beat frequency which is itself a radio frequency (for example, 100,000 cycles per second). 2. Rectification of the beat current. 3. Amplification at the beat radio frequency, preferably by a tuned amplifier. 4. Audio frequency modulation of the amplified current. 5. Rectification of the modulated current.

A general expression for phase-induced intensity noise that is applicable to all types of semiconductor lasers is derived by defining an optical self-SNR expression that can be used to analyze and measure phase-induced intensity noise. The result shows that in order to have a minimal phase-induced intensity noise in most digital optical incoherent systems, a large optical self-SNR, e.g., 20 dB or more, is needed. This in turn is shown to place a limit on the maximum rate of processing in a typical incoherent optical system even neglecting the bandwidth limitation of the photodetector. Furthermore, it is shown that the maximum rate of processing depends on the laser autocorrelation function and laser coherence time","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.878057","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/34914/01667826.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.878057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34914","startPage":"3059","endPage":"3072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-induced intensity noise in digital incoherent all-optical tapped-delay line systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase-induced intensity noise in digital incoherent all-optical tapped-delay line systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9029555","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1667826/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-induced intensity noise in digital incoherent all-optical tapped-delay line systems","sourcePdf":"01667826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081942S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"34914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"34914","articleId":"1667826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1667827,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, increasing the QKD bit rate using a communication system that includes a multiple-input-multiple-output quantum key distribution (MQKD) is proposed. Such a system can enable a number of receivers to communicate simultaneously with a number of transmitter elements, which consequently increases the overall QKD bit rate. However, due to scattering and turbulence in the atmospheric channel, this method may introduce interference effects when a photon transmitted from one transmitter element reaches the wrong detector element in the receiver. These interference effects reduce the system bit rate and increase the quantum bit error rate. A novel mathematical model for analyzing the effect of crosstalk and interference on the MQKD system performance is derived. The results of the analysis indicate that atmospheric effects impair performance. In order to mitigate the atmospheric effect, using several wavelengths simultaneously is suggested. Criteria to define the number of wavelengths that are required to achieve a given performance are also provided","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/34914/01667832.pdf","startPage":"3114","endPage":"3120","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.878043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.878043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34914","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum key distribution by a free-space MIMO system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Bit rate","Interference","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Performance analysis","Atmospheric waves","Optical fiber communication","Optical scattering","Particle scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","error statistics","MIMO systems","optical crosstalk","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters","quantum cryptography","quantum optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum key distribution","free-space optical communication link","multiple-input-multiple-output quantum key distribution","receiver","transmitter","interference effects","quantum bit error rate","crosstalk","MQKD","atmospheric effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","optical wireless communication","quantum key distribution (QKD)","turbulence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Quantum key distribution by a free-space MIMO system","volume":"24","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1667832/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9029561","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum key distribution by a free-space MIMO system","sourcePdf":"01667832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088436S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"34914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"34914","articleId":"1667832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1667833,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Devices have also been produced using an elliptical core fiber to study the effects of the cladding modification on the two polarization eigenstates. A cladding modification applied on the fast axis of the fiber is shown to affect the light in the fast axis much more significantly than the light in the orthogonal state; this behavior may ultimately lead to a sensor capable of detecting the direction of bending in two dimensions for applications in shape sensing","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.878037","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/34914/01667836.pdf","startPage":"3147","endPage":"3154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.878037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bending characteristics of fiber long-period gratings with cladding index modified by femtosecond laser","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667836/","displayDocTitle":"Bending characteristics of fiber long-period gratings with cladding index modified by femtosecond laser","volume":"24","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9029565","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1667836/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bending characteristics of fiber long-period gratings with cladding index modified by femtosecond laser","sourcePdf":"01667836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077057S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"34914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"34914","articleId":"1667836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1667847,"authors":[{"name":"Yaxun Liu","affiliation":["Edward S.

Vias facilitate complicated routings in these multilayer structures. Significant simultaneous switching noise (SSN) coupling occurs through the signal via transition when the signal via suffers return current interruption caused by reference plane exchange. The coupled SSN decreases noise and timing margins of digital and analog circuits, resulting in reduction of achievable jitter performance, bit error ratio (BER), and system reliability. We introduce a modeling method to estimate SSN coupling based on a balanced transmission line matrix (TLM) method. The proposed modeling method is successfully verified by a series of time-domain and frequency-domain measurements of several via transition structures. First, it is clearly verified that SSN coupling causes considerable clock waveform distortion, increases jitter and noise, and reduces margins in pseudorandom bit sequence (PRBS) eye patterns. We also note that the major frequency spectrum component of the coupled noise is one of the plane pair resonance frequencies in the PCB power/ground pair. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the amount of SSN noise coupling is strongly dependent not only on the position of the signal via, but also on the layer configuration of the multilayer PCB. Finally, we have successfully proposed and confirmed a design methodology to minimize the SSN coupling based on an optimal via positioning approach","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/34915/01667876.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2006.872996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2006.872996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and measurement of simultaneous switching noise coupling through signal via transition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Coupling circuits","Circuit noise","Nonhomogeneous media","Noise reduction","Jitter","Transmission line matrix methods","Integrated circuit interconnections","Printed circuits","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","integrated circuit interconnections","printed circuits","system-in-package","system-on-chip","time-domain analysis","transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous switching noise coupling","signal via transition","interconnection structure","system-on-package","SoP","printed circuit boards","system reliability","balanced transmission line matrix","TLM method","time-domain measurement","frequency-domain measurement","pseudorandom bit sequence","PRBS eye patterns","power-ground noise","reference plane change"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise coupling","power/ground noise","printed circuit board (PCB)","reference plane change","simultaneous switching noise (SSN)","system-on-package (SoP)","via"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and measurement of simultaneous switching noise coupling through signal via transition","volume":"29","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1667876/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9030694","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and measurement of simultaneous switching noise coupling through signal via transition","sourcePdf":"01667876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102173S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"34915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"34915","articleId":"1667876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667884,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Te Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Changhua, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chun-Te Wu was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1968.

Several maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods that force the operating point to oscillate have been presented in the past few decades. In the MPPT system, the ideal operation is to determine the maximum power point (MPP) of the photovoltaic (PV) array directly rather than to track it by using the active operation of trial and error, which causes undesirable oscillation around the MPP. Since the output features of a PV cell vary with environment changes in irradiance and temperature from time to time, real-time operation is required to trace the variations of local MPPs in PV power systems. The method of real-time estimation proposed in this paper uses polynomials to demonstrate the power-voltage relationship of PV panels and implements the recursive least-squares method and Newton-Raphson method to identify the voltage of the optimal operating point. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is successfully demonstrated by computer simulations and experimental evaluations of two major types of PV panels, namely: 1) crystalline silicon and 2) copper-indium-diselenide thin film","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Identification of Optimal Operating Points in Photovoltaic Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.878355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/34916/01667899.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.878355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34916","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Identification of Optimal Operating Points in Photovoltaic Power Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1667899/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9064478","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Identification of Optimal Operating Points in Photovoltaic Power Systems","sourcePdf":"01667899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063353S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"34916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"34916","articleId":"1667899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667900,"authors":[{"name":"I.-S.

The conventional method has problems in that it is impossible to quickly acquire the generation power at the maximum power (MP) point in low solar radiation (irradiation) regions. It is found theoretically and experimentally that the maximum output power and the optimal current, which give this maximum, have a linear relation at a constant temperature. Furthermore, it is also shown that linearity exists between the short-circuit current and the optimal current. MPPT control rules are created based on the findings from solar arrays that can respond at high speeds to variations in irradiation. The proposed MPPT control method sets the output current track on the line that gives the relation between the MP and the optimal current so as to acquire the MP that can be generated at that time by dividing the power and current characteristics into two fields. The method is based on the generated power being a binary function of the output current. Considering the experimental fact that linearity is maintained only at low irradiation below half the maximum irradiation, the proportionality coefficient (voltage coefficient) is compensated for only in regions with more than half the rated optimal current, which correspond to the maximum irradiation. At high irradiation, the voltage coefficient needed to perform the proposed MPPT control is acquired through the hill-climbing method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments under various weather conditions","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.878328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/34916/01667903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.878328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34916","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for MPPT Control While Searching for Parameters Corresponding to Weather Conditions for PV Generation Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Method for MPPT Control While Searching for Parameters Corresponding to Weather Conditions for PV Generation Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"4","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9064482","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1667903/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for MPPT Control While Searching for Parameters Corresponding to Weather Conditions for PV Generation Systems","sourcePdf":"01667903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088817S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"34916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"34916","articleId":"1667903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667905,"authors":[{"name":"G.O.

The hybrid power source composed of fuel cells and batteries provides a much higher peak power than each component alone while preserving high energy density, which is important and desirable for many modern electronic devices, through an appropriately controlled dc/dc power converter that handles the power flow shared by the fuel cell and the battery. Rather than being controlled to serve only as a voltage or current regulator, the power converter is regulated to balance the power flow to satisfy the load requirements while ensuring the various limitations of electrochemical components such as battery overcharge, fuel cell current limit (FCCL), etc. Digital technology is applied in the control of power electronics due to many advantages over analog technology such as programmability, less susceptibility to environmental variations, and low parts count. The user can set the FCCL, battery current limit, and battery voltage limit in the digital controller. A control algorithm that is suitable for regulating the multiple variables in the hybrid system is described by using a state-machine-based model; the issues about embedded control implementation are addressed; and the large-signal behavior of the hybrid system is analyzed on a voltage-current plane. The hybrid power source is then tested through simulation and validated on real hardware. This paper also discusses some important issues of the hybrid power source, such as operation under complex load profiles, power enhancement, and optimization of the hybrid system.

This paper presents a hybrid energy storage system with high life cycle, which is mainly based on compressed air, where the storage and discharge are done within maximum efficiency conditions. As the maximum efficiency conditions impose the level of converted power, an intermittent time-modulated operation mode is applied to the thermodynamic converter to obtain a variable converted mean power. A smoothly variable output power is achieved with the help of a supercapacitive auxiliary storage device used as a filter. This paper describes the concept of the system, the power-electronic interface circuits, and especially the maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) algorithm and the strategy used to vary the output power. In addition, this paper presents the characteristics of high-efficiency storage systems where the pneumatic machine is replaced by an oil-hydraulic and pneumatic converter, which is used under isothermal conditions. Practical results are also presented, which are recorded from a low-power pneumatic motor coupled to a small dc generator as well as from the first prototype of the final hydropneumatic system","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/34916/01667908.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.878323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.878323","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Energy Storage System Based on Compressed Air and Supercapacitors With Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MEPT)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667908/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Energy Storage System Based on Compressed Air and Supercapacitors With Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MEPT)","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1667908/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"9064487","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Energy Storage System Based on Compressed Air and Supercapacitors With Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MEPT)","sourcePdf":"01667908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04821S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"34916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"34916","articleId":"1667908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667912,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper exploits how a newly established real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test facility, which is designed for testing all-electric ship propulsion systems, can be utilized for wind energy research. The test site uses two 2.5-MW/220-rpm dynamometers and a 5-MW variable voltage and frequency converter to emulate a realistic dynamic environment, both mechanically and electrically. The facility is controlled by a digital real-time electric power system simulator that is capable of simulating electrical networks and control systems of substantial complexity, typically with a 50-mus time step. Substantial input/output allows the feedback of measured quantities into the simulation. A 15-kW mock-up motor-generator set is used to demonstrate some critical aspects of the concept including the implementation of a proposed neural-network-based sensorless maximum wind energy capture control. From the dynamic test results presented, it is concluded that the proposed system shows great potential for the development of a unified wind energy design, test, and research platform","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Unified Design, Test, and Research Platform for Wind Energy Systems Based on Hardware-in-the-Loop Real-Time Simulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.878319","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/34916/01667912.pdf","startPage":"1144","endPage":"1151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.878319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34916","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Unified Design, Test, and Research Platform for Wind Energy Systems Based on Hardware-in-the-Loop Real-Time Simulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1667912/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9064491","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Unified Design, Test, and Research Platform for Wind Energy Systems Based on Hardware-in-the-Loop Real-Time Simulation","sourcePdf":"01667912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059009S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"34916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"34916","articleId":"1667912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667915,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The novelty of this new sensorless structure is obtained by an intelligent mixing of the OL estimator response with the SS one. A fuzzy system weights the two estimated speed values according to the motor operating point. Then, the final speed value is obtained averaging the previously weighted speed values. Moreover, the OL estimator response is improved by means of using a fuzzy-controlled adaptive filter that selects the optimum cutoff frequency. The aim of this paper is to obtain a moderate performance sensorless drive for induction motors that could be easily implemented for industrial applications without a high computational effort.

The two-axis motion control system is an x-y table composed of two permanent-magnet linear synchronous motors. First, a single-axis motion dynamics with the introduction of a lumped uncertainty including cross-coupled interference between the two-axis mechanism is derived. Then, to improve the control performance in reference contours tracking, the RFNN sliding-mode control system is proposed to effectively approximate the equivalent control of the sliding-mode control method. Moreover, the motions at x-axis and y-axis are controlled separately. Using the proposed control, the motion tracking performance is significantly improved, and robustness to parameter variations, external disturbances, cross-coupled interference, and friction force can be obtained as well. Furthermore, the proposed control algorithms are implemented in a TMS320C32 DSP-based control computer. From the simulated and experimental results due to circle and four leaves reference contours, the dynamic behaviors of the proposed control systems are robust with regard to uncertainties","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/34916/01667919.pdf","startPage":"1209","endPage":"1225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.878312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.878312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34916","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Fuzzy Neural Network Sliding-Mode Control for Two-Axis Motion Control System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Sliding mode control","Motion control","Uncertainty","Interference","Control systems","Computer networks","Torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fuzzy neural nets","linear synchronous motors","machine control","motion control","neurocontrollers","permanent magnet motors","robust control","torque control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust fuzzy neural network","sliding mode control","torque control","two-axis motion control system","permanent magnet linear synchronous motor","single-axis motion dynamics","cross-couple interference","reference contours tracking","friction force","TMS320C32","DSP-based control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy neural network (FNN)","permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM)","sliding-mode control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Robust Fuzzy Neural Network Sliding-Mode Control for Two-Axis Motion Control System","volume":"53","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1667919/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9064498","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Fuzzy Neural Network Sliding-Mode Control for Two-Axis Motion Control System","sourcePdf":"01667919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068433S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"34916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"34916","articleId":"1667919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667921,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

It has been shown that these broken-rotor-bar specific frequencies are located around the fundamental stator current frequency and are termed lower and upper sideband components. Broken-rotor-bar fault-detection schemes should rely on multiple signatures in order to overcome or reduce the effect of any misinterpretation of the signatures that are obscured by factors such as measurement noises and different load conditions. Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide appropriate environments to develop such fault-detection schemes because of their multiinput-processing capabilities. This paper describes two fault-detection schemes for a broken-rotor-bar fault detection with a multiple signature processing and demonstrates that the multiple signature processing is more efficient than a single signature processing. The first scheme, which will be named the \"monolith scheme,\" is based on a single large-scale MDA or ANN unit representing the complete operating load-torque region of the motor, while the second scheme, which will be named the \"partition scheme,\" consists of many small-scale MDA or ANN units, each unit representing a particular load-torque operating region. Fault-detection performance comparison between the MDA and the ANN with respect to the two schemes is investigated using the experimental data collected for a healthy and a broken-rotor-bar case. Partition scheme distributes the computational load and complexity of the large-scale single units in a monolith scheme to many smaller units, which results in the increase of the broken-rotor-bar fault-detection performance, as is confirmed with the experimental results","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/34916/01667927.pdf","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.878301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.878301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34916","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1667927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Discriminant Analysis and Neural-Network-Based Monolith and Partition Fault-Detection Schemes for Broken Rotor Bar in Induction Motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Induction motors","Artificial neural networks","Frequency","Large-scale systems","Bars","Monitoring","Stators","Noise measurement","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machine analysis computing","fault diagnosis","induction motors","neural nets","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple discriminant analysis","artificial neural network","monolith fault detection","partition fault detection","broken rotor bar","induction motors","motor current spectrum","fundamental stator current frequency","multiple signatures processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks (ANNs)","broken rotor bar","discriminant analysis","fault diagnosis","induction motors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Discriminant Analysis and Neural-Network-Based Monolith and Partition Fault-Detection Schemes for Broken Rotor Bar in Induction Motors","volume":"53","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1667927/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9064506","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Discriminant Analysis and Neural-Network-Based Monolith and Partition Fault-Detection Schemes for Broken Rotor Bar in Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"01667927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08208S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"34916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"34916","articleId":"1667927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667928,"authors":[{"name":"S.-K.

The conventional FPNNs developed so far are based on mechanisms of self-organization and evolutionary optimization. The design of the network exploits the extended group method of data handling, with some essential parameters of the network being provided by the designer and kept fixed throughout the overall development process. This restriction may hamper a possibility of producing an optimal architecture of the model. The design proposed in this paper addresses this issue. The augmented genetically optimized FPNN (gFPNN) results in a structurally optimized structure and comes with a higher level of flexibility in comparison with the one encountered in the conventional FPNN. The GA-based design procedure that is applied to each layer of FPNN leads to the selection of the preferred nodes (or fuzzy polynomial neurons) available within the FPNN. In the sequel, two general optimization mechanisms are explored. First, the structural optimization is realized via GAs, whereas the ensuing, detailed parametric optimization is carried out in the setting of a standard least-square-method-based learning. The performance of gFPNN is quantified through experimentation where a number of modeling benchmarks are being used, i.e., synthetic and experimental data already experimented within fuzzy or neurofuzzy modeling.

In this control scheme, a four-layer neural fuzzy network (NFN) is utilized for the major control role, and the adaptive tuning laws of network parameters are derived in the sense of a projection algorithm and the Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure network convergence as well as stable control performance. The merits of this model-free control scheme are that not only can the stable position tracking performance be guaranteed but also no prior system information and auxiliary control design are required in the control process. In addition, numerical simulations and experimental results of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by dc servo motors are provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RNFNC methodology","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.878297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.878297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/34916/01667930.pdf","startPage":"1328","endPage":"1349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Neural-Fuzzy-Network Control for Robot Manipulator Including Actuator Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1667930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Robust Neural-Fuzzy-Network Control for Robot Manipulator Including Actuator Dynamics","volume":"53","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9064509","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1667930/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Neural-Fuzzy-Network Control for Robot Manipulator Including Actuator Dynamics","sourcePdf":"01667930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105954S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"34916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"34916","articleId":"1667930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1667934,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Second, we want to advance the study of ethical theory by making it more precise. Finally, we want to solve a particular problem in ethical theory, to develop a decision procedure for an ethical theory that involves multiple, potentially competing, and duties. We've adopted the action-based approach to ethical theory, where the theory tells us how we should act in ethical dilemmas. This approach lends itself to machine implementation by giving the agent either a single principle or several principles to guide its actions, unlike other approaches that don't clearly specify the correct action in an ethical dilemma.

The method relies primarily on the geometric 3D structure of the proteins, which is produced from the corresponding PDB files and secondarily on their primary and secondary structure. After proper positioning of the 3D structures, in terms of translation and scaling, the spherical trace transform is applied to them so as to produce geometry-based descriptor vectors, which are completely rotation invariant and perfectly describe their 3D shape. Additionally, characteristic attributes of the primary and secondary structure of the protein molecules are extracted, forming attribute-based descriptor vectors. The descriptor vectors are weighted and an integrated descriptor vector is produced. Three classification methods are tested. A part of the FSSP/DALI database, which provides a structural classification of the proteins, is used as the ground truth in order to evaluate the classification accuracy of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 99 percent classification accuracy while remaining much simpler and faster than the DALI method","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2006.43","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/34920/01668019.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2006.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Shape-Structure Comparison Method for Protein Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668019/","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Shape-Structure Comparison Method for Protein Classification","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9067091","pubMedId":"17048458","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1668019/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Shape-Structure Comparison Method for Protein Classification","sourcePdf":"01668019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149509S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"34920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"34920","articleId":"1668019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1668035,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A repeatable binary string, which we call a biometric key, is generated reliably from genuine iris codes. A well-known difficulty has been how to cope with the 10 to 20 percent of error bits within an iris code and derive an error-free key. To solve this problem, we carefully studied the error patterns within iris codes and devised a two-layer error correction technique that combines Hadamard and Reed-Solomon codes. The key is generated from a subject's iris image with the aid of auxiliary error-correction data, which do not reveal the key and can be saved in a tamper-resistant token, such as a smart card. The reproduction of the key depends on two factors: the iris biometric and the token. The attacker has to procure both of them to compromise the key. We evaluated our technique using iris samples from 70 different eyes, with 10 samples from each eye. We found that an error-free key can be reproduced reliably from genuine iris codes with a 99.5 percent success rate. We can generate up to 140 bits of biometric key, more than enough for 128-bit AES. The extraction of a repeatable binary string from biometrics opens new possible applications, where a strong binding is required between a person and cryptographic operations. For example, it is possible to identify individuals without maintaining a central database of biometric templates, to which privacy objections-might be raised","doi":"10.1109/TC.2006.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/34921/01668036.pdf","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Crypto with Biometrics Effectively","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Combining Crypto with Biometrics Effectively","volume":"55","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1668036/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9066877","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668036/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Crypto with Biometrics Effectively","sourcePdf":"01668036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155369S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"34921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"359","xplore-issue":"34921","articleId":"1668036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1668037,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Some of these gates may become faulty in the field due to natural causes or malicious attacks, which may lead to the generation of erroneous outputs by the multiplier. In this paper, we propose new architectures to detect erroneous outputs caused by certain types of faults in bit-parallel and bit-serial polynomial basis multipliers over finite fields of characteristic two.

Among the former, fault attacks (FA) and single power analysis (SPA) are probably the most effective: when applied to straightforward implementations of the RSA cryptosystem, only one execution of the algorithm is required to recover the secret key. Over recent years, many countermeasures have been proposed to prevent side channel attacks on RSA. Regarding fault attacks, only one countermeasure offers effective protection and it can be very costly. In this paper, we focus on a means to counteract fault attacks by presenting a new way of implementing exponentiation algorithms. This method can be used to obtain fast FA-resistant RSA signature generations in both the straightforward method and Chinese remainder theorem modes. Moreover, as it has been shown that fault attacks can benefit from the weaknesses introduced by some SPA countermeasures, we ensure that our method resists SPA and, thus, does not require supplementary SPA countermeasures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1668039/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","accessionNumber":"9066880","volume":"55","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An RSA Implementation Resistant to Fault Attacks and to Simple Power Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An RSA Implementation Resistant to Fault Attacks and to Simple Power Analysis","sourcePdf":"01668039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081085S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"34921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"34921","articleId":"1668039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1668063,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Yeu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/34922/1668063/1668063-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Yeu Chen received the BS and MS degrees in Electrical Engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan.

Computing aggregates such as average, minimum, maximum and sum is fundamental to various primitive functions of a sensor network, such as system monitoring, data querying, and collaborative information processing. In this paper, we present and analyze a suite of randomized distributed algorithms to efficiently and robustly compute aggregates. Our distributed random grouping (DRG) algorithm is simple and natural and uses probabilistic grouping to progressively converge to the aggregate value. DRG is local and randomized and is naturally robust against dynamic topology changes from link/node failures. Although our algorithm is natural and simple, it is nontrivial to show that it converges to the correct aggregate value and to bound the time needed for convergence. Our analysis uses the eigenstructure of the underlying graph in a novel way to show convergence and to bound the running time of our algorithms. We also present simulation results of our algorithm and compare its performance to various other known distributed algorithms. Simulations show that DRG needs far fewer transmissions than other distributed localized schemes","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Computation of Aggregates in Wireless Sensor Networks: Distributed Randomized Algorithms and Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2006.128","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/34922/01668063.pdf","startPage":"987","endPage":"1000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2006.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Robust Computation of Aggregates in Wireless Sensor Networks: Distributed Randomized Algorithms and Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1668063/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9083081","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Computation of Aggregates in Wireless Sensor Networks: Distributed Randomized Algorithms and Analysis","sourcePdf":"01668063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085064S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"34922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"34922","articleId":"1668063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1668065,"authors":[{"name":"Chenyang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/34922/1668065/1668065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenyang Lu received the BS degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1995, the MS degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1997, and the PhD degree from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in 2001, all in computer science.

Combining the horizontal expansion and vertical stacking of optical banyan networks is a general scheme for constructing banyan-based optical switching networks. The resulting horizontally expanded and vertically stacked optical banyan (HVOB) networks usually take either a high hardware cost or a large network depth to guarantee the nonblocking property. Blocking behavior analysis is an effective approach to studying network performance and finding a graceful compromise among hardware cost, network depth, and blocking probability; however, little has been done to analyze the blocking behavior of general HVOB networks. In this paper, we study the overall blocking behavior of general HVOB networks, where an upper bound on the blocking probability of a HVOB network is developed with respect to the number of planes (stacked copies) and the number of stages. The upper bound accurately depicts the overall blocking behavior of a HVOB network as verified by an extensive simulation study, and it agrees with the strictly nonblocking condition of the network. The derived upper bound is significant because it reveals the inherent relationship among blocking probability, network depth, and network hardware cost, so that a desirable tradeoff can be made among them. In particular, our bound gives network developers an effective tool to estimate the maximum blocking probability of a HVOB network, in which different routing strategies can be applied with a guaranteed performance in terms of blocking probability, hardware cost and network depth. Our upper bound model predicts some unobvious qualitative behaviors of HVOB networks, and it draws an important conclusion that a very low blocking probability (e.g., less than 0.001 percent) can be achieved in a HVOB network without introducing either a significantly high hardware cost or a large network depth","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2006.126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/34922/01668067.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2006.126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overall Blocking Behavior Analysis of General Banyan-Based Optical Switching Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Overall Blocking Behavior Analysis of General Banyan-Based Optical Switching Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668067/","volume":"17","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1668067/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9083085","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overall Blocking Behavior Analysis of General Banyan-Based Optical Switching Networks","sourcePdf":"01668067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068937S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"34922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"34922","articleId":"1668067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1668079,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The visual inspection is often carried out by a human expert. However, new technology features have made this inspection unreliable. For this reason, many researchers have been engaged to develop automatic analysis processes of manufactures and automatic optical inspections in the industrial production of printed circuit boards. Among the defects that could arise in this industrial process, those of the solder joints are very important, because they can lead to an incorrect functioning of the board; moreover, the amount of the solder paste can give some information on the quality of the industrial process. In this paper, a neural network-based automatic optical inspection system for the diagnosis of solder joint defects on printed circuit boards assembled in surface mounting technology is presented. The diagnosis is handled as a pattern recognition problem with a neural network approach. Five types of solder joints have been classified in respect to the amount of solder paste in order to perform the diagnosis with a high recognition rate and a detailed classification able to give information on the quality of the manufacturing process. The images of the boards under test are acquired and then preprocessed to extract the region of interest for the diagnosis. Three types of feature vectors are evaluated from each region of interest, which are the images of the solder joints under test, by exploiting the properties of the wavelet transform and the geometrical characteristics of the preprocessed images. The performances of three different classifiers which are a multilayer perceptron, a linear vector quantization, and a K-nearest neighbor classifier are compared. The n-fold cross-validation has been exploited to select the best architecture for the neural classifiers, while a number of experiments have been devoted to estimating the best value of K in the K-NN. The results have proved that the MLP network fed with the GW-features has the best recognition rate. This approach allows to carry out the diagnosis burden on image processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms, reducing the cost and the complexity of the acquisition system. In fact, the experimental results suggest that the reason for the high recognition rate in the solder joint classification is due to the proper preprocessing steps followed as well as to the information contents of the features","doi":"10.1109/TII.2006.877265","startPage":"200","endPage":"209","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

OPC is realized with difference frequency generation (DFG) in a periodically poled lithium-niobate (PPLN) waveguide, for transparent wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) operation with high conversion efficiency. We discuss extensively the principle behind optical phase conjugation and the realization of a polarization independent OPC subsystem. Using OPC for chromatic dispersion compensation WDM 40-Gb/s long-haul transmission is described. As well, transmission employing both mixed data rates and mixed modulation formats is discussed. No significant nonlinear impairments are observed from the nonperiodic dispersion map used in these experiments. The compensation of intrachannel nonlinear impairments by OPC is described for WDM carrier-suppressed return-to-zero (CSRZ) transmission. In this experiment, a 50% increase in transmission reach is obtained by adding an OPC unit to a transmission line using dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) for dispersion compensation. Furthermore, the compensation of impairments due to nonlinear phase noise is reviewed. An in-depth analysis is conducted on what performance improvement is to be expected for various OPC configurations and a proof-of-principle experiment is described showing over 4-dB improvement in Q-factor due to compensation of nonlinear impairments resulting from nonlinear phase noise. Finally, an ultralong-haul WDM transmission of 22times20-Gb/s return-to-zero differential quadrature phase-shift keying (RZ-DQPSK) is discussed showing that OPC can compensate for chromatic dispersion, as well as self-phase modulation (SPM) induced nonlinear impairments, such as nonlinear phase noise. Compared to a \"conventional\" transmission link using DCF for dispersion compensation, a 44% increase in transmission reach is obtained when OPC is employed. In this experiment, we show the feasibility of using only one polarization-independent PPLN subsystem to compensate for an accumulated chromatic dispersion of over 160 000 ps/nm","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/34924/01668091.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2006.876621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2006.876621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34924","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-haul DWDM transmission systems employing optical phase conjugation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Chromatic dispersion","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Phase noise","Optical waveguides","Optical frequency conversion","Wavelength conversion","Optical modulation","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium compounds","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre polarisation","optical frequency conversion","optical phase conjugation","phase noise","Q-factor","self-phase modulation","transparency","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-haul transmission systems","DWDM","optical phase conjugation","chromatic dispersion compensation","nonlinear impairments","difference frequency generation","periodically poled lithium-niobate waveguide","transparent wavelength-division multiplexing","polarization independent subsystem","mixed modulation formats","nonperiodic optical dispersion map","intrachannel impairments","carrier-suppressed return-to-zero transmission","transmission line","dispersion compensating fiber","nonlinear phase noise","return-to-zero differential quadrature phase-shift keying","self-phase modulation","40 Gbit/s","20 Gbit/s","440 Gbit/s","LiNbO3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dispersion compensation","differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)","differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK)","duobinary","fiber-optics communications","nonlinear phase noise","phase conjugation","phase-shift keying","periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN)","spectral inversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Long-haul DWDM transmission systems employing optical phase conjugation","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1668091/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9029021","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-haul DWDM transmission systems employing optical phase conjugation","sourcePdf":"01668091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132651S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"34924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"34924","articleId":"1668091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1668095,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The various types of FEC are classified as belonging to one of three generations. A third-generation FEC, based on a block turbo code, has been fully integrated in very large scale integration, and thanks to the use of 3-bit soft decision, a net coding gain of 10.1 dB was demonstrated experimentally.

Since the whole optical signal information is preserved with our receiver, various kinds of postprocessing of the received signal become possible. For example, we can demultiplex wavelength-division/optical time-division multiplexed channels and compensate for group velocity dispersion of fibers as well as the nonlinear phase noise in the electrical domain. We also experimentally evaluate the performance of our receiver.

In external frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation using single-sideband modulation technology, an optical upper/lower sideband (USB/LSB) component with respect to a carrier frequency is selectively generated. However, the FSK-modulated signal has phase discontinuities at the timings of frequency shifts. To overcome the problem, we propose a synchronous control technique that enables continuous phase modulation. In the external CPFSK modulation, the USB/LSB is allowed to shift to the other state when their phases coincide with each other. It is shown that CPFSK with a zero-to-peak frequency deviation of 0.5times(bit rate) is achieved with this synchronous control. Occupant bandwidth is less than half that of the externally modulated incoherent FSK with phase discontinuities. At a modulation speed of 10 Gb/s, higher order sidelobes are highly suppressed by more than 20 dB at the 20-GHz offset, comparing to a conventional binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). By the use of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with balanced photodetection, receiver sensitivity is 3-dB greater than that of an on-off keying, as well as a BPSK. In this paper, we report on the experimental demonstration of CPFSK modulation/demodulation.

While traditionally considered difficult to measure, its presence is shown to have significant impact on amplifier power excursion during dynamic wavelength add-drop, due to the energy transitions inherent to the Tm/sup 3+/ ion. For specific pumping scheme and operating conditions, gain increases with increasing signal input, a behavior significantly different from conventional three-level optical amplifiers. Numerical models are presented that correctly account for these phenomena. This promises to provide insight for gain control algorithms for TDFAs under bursty traffic conditions in a future reconfigurable wavelength division multiplexed environment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2006.876588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/34924/01668124.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"803","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2006.876588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ground state absorption in thulium-doped fiber amplifier: experiment and modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Ground state absorption in thulium-doped fiber amplifier: experiment and modeling","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1668124/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9029054","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground state absorption in thulium-doped fiber amplifier: experiment and modeling","sourcePdf":"01668124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060336S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"34924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"34924","articleId":"1668124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1668130,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Spatial discrete multitone modulation is introduced as a means to combat low-pass spatial distortion and to alleviate spatial alignment problems of previous systems. The capacity of pixelated wireless optical channels is estimated by way of a water-pouring spectrum.

In order to further investigate this effect and compare experimental findings with theory, a new test device that enables modulation of the damping interaction between a surface micromachined resonator and the substrate has been fabricated. The device consists of a surface micromachined polysilicon microresonator, which is self-elevated out of the plane of the substrate using a bimorph beam. A second, identical microresonator lying parallel to the plane of the substrate has also been fabricated. Both devices have been fabricated using the polysilicon multiuser microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) processes (polyMUMPs). The resonator-to-substrate separation of the elevated resonator is varied by changing the temperature of the bimorph beam, and the Q factors for different separations have been measured.

The particles are steered by creating a fluid flow that carries all the particles from where they are to where they should be at each time step. Our control loop comprises sensing, computation, and actuation to steer particles along user-input trajectories. Particle locations are identified in real-time by an optical system and transferred to a control algorithm that then determines the electrode voltages necessary to create a flow field to carry all the particles to their next desired locations. The process repeats at the next time instant. Our method achieves inexpensive steering of particles by using conventional electroosmotic actuation in microfluidic channels. This type of particle steering does not require optical traps and can noninvasively steer neutral or charged particles and objects that cannot be captured by laser tweezers. (Laser tweezers cannot steer reflective particles, or particles where the index of refraction is lower than (or for more sophisticated optical vortex holographic tweezers does not differ substantially from) that of the surrounding medium.)

We model the fluid dynamics by using Hele-Shaw type equations with a focus on including the relevant boundary phenomena. Specifically, we show that contact angle saturation and hysteresis are needed to predict the correct shape and time scale of droplet motion. We demonstrate this by comparing our simulation to experimental data for a splitting droplet. Without these boundary effects, the simulation shows the droplet splitting into three pieces instead of two and the motion is over 15 times faster than the experiment. We then show how including the saturation characteristics of the device, and a simple model of contact angle hysteresis, allows the simulation to better predict the splitting experiment. The match is not perfect and suffers mainly because contact line pinning is not included. This is followed by a comparison between our simulation, whose parameters are now frozen, and a new experiment involving bulk droplet motion. Our numerical implementation uses the level set method, is fast, and is being used to design algorithms for the precise control of microdroplet motion, mixing, and splitting","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2006.878876","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/34926/01668195.pdf","startPage":"986","endPage":"1000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2006.878876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the fluid dynamics of electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668195/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the fluid dynamics of electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD)","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9033776","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1668195/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the fluid dynamics of electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD)","sourcePdf":"01668195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114959S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"34926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"34926","articleId":"1668195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1668197,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Electrophysics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/34926/1668197/1668197-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongyu Yu (M'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from the Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Southern California in 2005.","He is currently working as a Postdoctorial Research Associate in the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California.

The self-focused waves from the PZT array propagate through 200-mum-thick silicon without any significant energy loss, and move the liquid contained in the channels and chambers (without a cover) on a micromachined silicon chip, up to 123 mm/s in-plane speed. The PZT array (consisting of a PZT sheet with an array of electrode patterns for sectored Fresnel rings) is bonded to the micromachined silicon chip to produce a fast in-plane liquid motion in the open channels and chambers.

Numerous coalition formation algorithms have been proposed in the software agent literature. Algorithms exist that form agent coalitions in both super additive and non-super additive environments. The algorithmic techniques vary from negotiation-based protocols in multi-agent system (MAS) environments to those based on computation in distributed problem solving (DPS) environments. Coalition formation behaviors have also been discussed in relation to game theory. Despite the plethora of MAS coalition formation literature, to the best of our knowledge none of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated with an actual multi-robot system. There exists a discrepancy between the multi-agent algorithms and their applicability to the multi-robot domain. This paper aims to bridge that discrepancy by unearthing the issues that arise while attempting to tailor these algorithms to the multi-robot domain. A well-known multi-agent coalition formation algorithm has been studied in order to identify the necessary modifications to facilitate its application to the multi-robot domain. This paper reports multi-robot coalition formation results based upon simulation and actual robot experiments. A multi-agent coalition formation algorithm has been demonstrated on an actual robot system.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2006.878948","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/34928/01668250.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"649","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2006.878948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-robot coalition formation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multi-robot coalition formation","volume":"22","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","accessionNumber":"9031330","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1668250/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-robot coalition formation","sourcePdf":"01668250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07719S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"34928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"34928","articleId":"1668250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1668259,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Inspired by the sensory feedback and neuromotor structure of insects, we propose a similar top-down hierarchical architecture to achieve high performance despite the MFIs' limited on-board computational resources. The flight stabilization problem is formulated as high-frequency periodic control of an underactuated system. In particular, we provide a methodology to approximate the time-varying dynamics caused by the aerodynamic forces with a time-invariant model using averaging theory and a biomimetic parametrization of the wing trajectories. This approximation leads to a simpler dynamical model that can be identified using experimental data from the on-board sensors and the voltage inputs to the wing actuators. The overall control law is a periodic proportional output feedback. Simulations, including sensor and actuator models, demonstrate stable flight in hovering mode.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9031341","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1668261/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flapping flight for biomimetic robotic insects: part II-flight control design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flapping flight for biomimetic robotic insects: part II-flight control design","sourcePdf":"01668261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094979S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"34928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"34928","articleId":"1668261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1668262,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Hui Liu","affiliation":["Joint Center of Intelligent Sensing and Systems, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China","Department of Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/34928/1668262/1668262-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun-Hui Liu (S'90\u2013M'92\u2013SM'98) received the B.Eng. degree in applied dynamics from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1985, the M.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematical engineering and information physics from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1992.","He wwas with the Electrotechnical Laboratory, MITI, Japan, from 1992 to 1995.

Using the depth-independent interaction matrix makes the unknown camera parameters appear linearly in the closed-loop dynamics so that a new algorithm is developed to estimate their values on-line. This adaptive algorithm combines the Slotine-Li method with on-line minimization of the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature points on the image plane.

The system in its current configuration is designed to enable distance training of students in real scenarios of robot manipulator programming. From a technological perspective, the research work presented in this paper is directed towards the adaptation of concepts and techniques developed in the field of telerobotics and virtual reality, and their integration in such e-laboratory settings. This paper focuses particularly on the educational impact of such systems. The goal is to assess the performance of e-laboratory scenarios in terms of the efficacy of training provided to students. The results of a pilot experimental study are presented, providing a comparative evaluation for three training modalities: real, remote, and virtual training on robot manipulator programming. The experiments were conducted according to an evaluation protocol specially designed for the considered target training task, using scoring charts to obtain quantitative performance measures and assess the performance of the student groups participating in the course. Training, as a dynamic process, is approached according to a classical three dimensional model, and performance scores are accordingly assessed in these dimensions (namely: low-level versus mid and high-level skills and understanding). The obtained results reveal certain differences between the three groups, particularly as related to the low-level skill training score, giving some insight about the training `dimensions' that are expected to be mostly affected by the absence of physical (or realistic virtual) presence in a real hands-on experimentation. Statistical analysis indicates, however, that, despite these apparent differences, such e-laboratory modules can be integrated quite effectively in practical scenarios, creating virtual training environments that can provide adequate learning elements, as related particularly to mid and high-level skill acquisition. Further work and large-scale studies are still needed, though, in order to explore the extent to which such a general conclusion is valid in different training settings, and to form the basis of a more theoretical evaluation for a comprehensive understanding of the pedagogical differences between real, virtual, and remote learning/training methodologies and experiences","doi":"10.1109/TE.2006.879255","startPage":"360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/34929/01668280.pdf","endPage":"369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2006.879255","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668280/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual and remote robotic laboratory: comparative experimental evaluation","volume":"49","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1668280/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9020879","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual and remote robotic laboratory: comparative experimental evaluation","sourcePdf":"01668280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069786S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"34929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"34929","articleId":"1668280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1668283,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Since electronics is an important grounding for other disciplines (computer science, signal processing, and communications), this approach proposes the development of multidisciplinary projects using the project-based learning (PBL) strategy for increasing the attractiveness of the curriculum. The proposed curriculum structure consists of eight courses: four theoretical courses and four PBL courses (including a compulsory Master's thesis). In PBL courses, the students, working together in groups, develop multidisciplinary systems, which become progressively more complex. To address this complexity, the Department of Electronic Engineering has invested in the last five years in many resources for developing software tools and a common hardware. This curriculum has been evaluated successfully for the last four academic years: the students have increased their interest in electronics and have given the courses an average grade of more than 71% for all PBL course evaluations (data extracted from students surveys). The students have also acquired new skills and obtained very good academic results: the average grade was more than 74% for all PBL courses. An important result is that all students have developed more complex and sophisticated electronic systems, while considering that the results are worth the effort invested","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A project-based learning approach to design electronic systems curricula","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","doi":"10.1109/TE.2006.879784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/34929/01668283.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2006.879784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668283","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"A project-based learning approach to design electronic systems curricula","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1668283/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9020882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A project-based learning approach to design electronic systems curricula","sourcePdf":"01668283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061516S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"34929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"34929","articleId":"1668283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":1668291,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The advantage of this technique is that it is derived entirely from load-pull measurements and provides an analytic method to utilize the load-pull measurements in practical designs.

Realizing that the most difficult problem stands on the phase measurement, it starts by reviewing the most common approaches used for the phase characterization of spectral regrowth components. It is demonstrated that these methods can be viewed as correlation processes, and are so framed in a common theory. This allows a unique and universal definition of the input-output amplitude and phase relations, even for mixing products that fall on frequency positions for which there are no components present at the input, and for those arising from incommensurate excitations. Finally, it shows how that theory can be implemented in a laboratory measurement scheme, thus giving the introduced theoretical variables a practical engineering value","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Microwave technology","Phase measurement","Distortion measurement","Microwave devices","Laboratories","Nonlinear systems","Testing","Telecommunications","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","microwave mixers","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear microwave devices","nonlinear mixing products","waveform analysis","amplitude characterization","phase characterization","spectral regrowth components","correlation process","input-output amplitude","phase relations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioral science","nonlinear systems","waveform analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.879171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34931/01668340.pdf","startPage":"3237","endPage":"3245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.879171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude and phase characterization of nonlinear mixing products","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude and phase characterization of nonlinear mixing products","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668340/","volume":"54","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1668340/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9031031","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude and phase characterization of nonlinear mixing products","sourcePdf":"01668340.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086048S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"34931","articleId":"1668340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1668341,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In this paper, a new RF amplifier linearization scheme using a compensating transistor combination is proposed. The devised approach ably utilizes all terminals of an additional transistor that offers a unified pre-post-distortion and cubic distortion characteristic for performance improvement. Meticulous modeling along with a power-dependent Volterra series is performed to identify contributions on each mechanism under various power levels. An experimental four-tone test reveals a maximum 28-dB reduction for the intermodulation distortion at 1.95 GHz, which outperforms typical pre-distortions of 5-10 dB. A single-ended two-stage amplifier module demonstrates a state-of-the-art power efficiency of 55% with 27-dB transducer gain at 24-dBm output power. Meanwhile, the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR/sub 1/) is maintained with good margins of -35dBc for a four-channel wideband code-division multiple-access signal under all output dynamics. Graceful degradations on modulation bandwidths, tone spacing, bias, and gain variations are also discussed, showing superb performance with virtually no dedicated retuning circuit parameters for multicarrier applications. By combining a bias control along with the proposed linearization technique, the average efficiency (12%) is 3/spl times/ higher than that of the fixed bias (3.94%), demonstrating the potential utility on further prolonging battery lifetime in practical scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.877815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.877815","startPage":"3255","endPage":"3266","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34931/01668342.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-efficiency linear RF Amplifier - a unified circuit approach to achieving compactness and low distortion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"High-efficiency linear RF Amplifier - a unified circuit approach to achieving compactness and low distortion","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2006","volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1668342/","accessionNumber":"9031033","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1668342/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-efficiency linear RF Amplifier - a unified circuit approach to achieving compactness and low distortion","sourcePdf":"01668342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090432S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"34931","articleId":"1668342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1668344,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Xu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/34931/1668344/1668344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Xu (S'06) was born in Bengbu, China, in 1976.

The increased use of power electronic converters as part of loading systems provides further problems for power quality by introducing harmonics, voltage dips, etc. It has been shown that knowledge of power system parameters (particularly the net power system impedance to source) at any instant in time is central to addressing these problems. This paper develops a method for ultra-fast real-time on-line power system impedance estimation, which has the potential to enhance the performance of power quality devices, distributed generation and power system protection.

The \"deep build-together\" strategy is proposed to simultaneously consider this rebuilding by transmission and distribution networks, thereby, to serve the maximum of customers in a minimum of time. The restoration problem has to be now formulated as a multilevel, multi-objective optimization problem with constraints.

The key or other sensitive information can be guessed by monitoring the execution time, the power variation and/or the electromagnetic radiation of the integrated circuit. This class of so-called side-channel attacks doesn't need expensive equipment or intrusive monitoring to be effective. We have shown that we can obtain the secret key out of a regular standard CMOS implementation of the AES encryption algorithm by monitoring the power consumption of only 2000 encryptions. This is orders of magnitude lower than the mathematical security of 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">128</sup>\n possible encryption keys to break the algorithm. The root cause of this problem is that standard CMOS is power efficient and it will only consume dynamic power when nodes are switching. Mathematical solutions have been proposed that include randomization and masking techniques. Our original approach is that we address the problem at circuit level. Instead of a full custom layout, a few key modifications are incorporated in a regular synchronous CMOS standard cell design flow.

The object of these measurements is to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves. It has been shown that these phenomena can be studied only by continued measurements. Curves are presented showing the field strengths on three successive days and nights once each month for the year February, 1923-January, 1924. In view of the agreement of the calculated values of field strength and the values actually found at night, it is concluded that the night value is to be regarded as the normal one and the day value as the abnormal or disturbed one. An explanation of the diminution of field intensity is given by assuming that the atmosphere is \"electrically turbid\" by day in consequence of the heating of the earth and the resulting vertical motion of masses of heated air. The waves are refracted, absorbed or reflected (and hence weakened) at the boundary surfaces of air masses of different densities. Diurnal and annual variations of field intensity can be readily explained by this theory. It was not possible to establish any difference between field intensity in a large city and in nearby open country. The derivation of a universally applicable formula giving the field strength, while taking account of all absorption losses, is regarded as impossible at present.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb. 1925","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1925","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1669511/","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1925","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Recent Investigations on the Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent Investigations on the Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves","sourcePdf":"01669511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03244S","chronDate":"Feb. 1925","isNumber":"34955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1669511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1925","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1669513,"authors":[{"name":"B.R.

The system is then shown in outline by means of a block diagram, the elements of which are subsequently discussed in greater detail. The theory, electrical design, and mechanical construction of the last two stages of the amplifier are outlined, including the output and antenna circuits. Means employed to prevent spurious oscillations are described. The method used in increasing the transmission band width to a value much greater than that of the antenna is explained. The power requirements of a single sideband installation are outlined and a description of the six-phase rectifier used as a source of high potential direct current is given, together with a brief theoretical treatment of its operation.

The aim in design for audio amplifiers is stated to be a reasonable voltage amplification for one tube and one transformer which is independent of the frequency over a range necessary for broadcast reception. The equivalent a.c. circuit for some types of transformers with tube source and tube load is set up and solved. The impedance and voltage amplification characteristics are explained from the solution of the equivalent circuit. Expressions for calculating the constants of the transformer are given. A study of the design relations and voltage amplification characteristics reveals difficulties which are encountered in design and some methods for overcoming these difficulties. The effect of the continuous flux in the core of the transformer is illustrated and a scheme is given for balancing out the continuous flux. A rather universal type of bridge for making the necessary impedance measurements in connection with transformer studies is shown. This bridge is adapted to measuring iron core coils, which carry both alternating and continuous currents, when either inductive or capacitive reactive.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34982","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547934/34982/01669943.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1928.221356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1928.221356","startPage":"1742","endPage":"1770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Design of Transformers for Audio-Frequency Amplifiers with Preassigned Characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 1928","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1928","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1669943/","displayDocTitle":"The Design of Transformers for Audio-Frequency Amplifiers with Preassigned Characteristics","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1928","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Design of Transformers for Audio-Frequency Amplifiers with Preassigned Characteristics","sourcePdf":"01669943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023839S","chronDate":"Dec. 1928","isNumber":"34982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1669943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1928","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1669991,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

(2) With a given direct current flowing through the winding of a choke coil, the inductance varies to a marked extent with the magnitude of the alternating current flowing through the winding. Methods of measurement which do not take into account or measure the magnitude of the alternating current are, therefore, unreliable. (3) The inductance for given conditions may be determined from the saturation curve of the coil. It is determined by the average slope of the saturation curve over the range within which the current varies. Three modifications of the ammeter-voltmeter method of measuring inductance are presented: (1) The circuit used in thefirst modification of this method is applicable where only a few approximate measurements are to be made and where simplicity of connection is of the greatest importance. (2) The second modification of the method involves simplicity of connection and permits of greater accuracy of measurement than does the first modification, but where a large number of measurements are to be made, it involves inconvenience of manipulation. (3) The third modification of the ammeter-voltmeter method of measuring the inductance of choke coils involves the use of apparatus not always available, but permits of accuracy of measurement and convenience of manipulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34984","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547934/34984/01669991.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1928.221404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1928.221404","startPage":"373","endPage":"384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Measurement of Choke Coil Inductance","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March 1928","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1928","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1669991/","displayDocTitle":"The Measurement of Choke Coil Inductance","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"March 1928","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Measurement of Choke Coil Inductance","sourcePdf":"01669991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027874S","chronDate":"March 1928","isNumber":"34984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1669991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1928","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
