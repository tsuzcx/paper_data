A unit energy constraint is imposed on the target response in a magnetic recording channel as well as a QC free constraint. A comparison to Partial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) is made in a magnetic recording system. Simulation results indicate that significant performance improvement over PRML can be achieved especially at high recording densities. A DC free constraint on the target response is shown to yield a better performance comparing to solutions without the constraint.

Recording spectral analysis and AFM measurement yield disk surface parameters, surface roughness, correlation lengths of the texturing process both parallel and perpendicular to the texture line direction, and cross-hatch angle, all of which are used to characterize the texture noise. An error rate model that includes correlated texture noise is developed. Results are presented for various recorded patterns on disks with different textures.

This hybrid approach is a solution to the issues stemming from the small size and odd shape of the SRM airgap, where meshing a FEM grid is difficult. In the past, the stator and rotor FEM domains kept their actual shapes, which resulted in problems with the definition of the unit outward normal vector n~ at the corner points of the SRM poles. So, the normal derivative of the magnetic vector potential, that is the tangential component of the flux density, was undefined at these points. In this paper, a new approach with new definitions of the stator and rotor FEM domains is presented. The new concept defines the SRM airgap as a ring in which circular boundaries permit the correct definition of the normal derivative quantities and exploits the natural Neumann condition. The electromagnetic parameters of a 7.5 kW SRM prototype machine were calculated using this new approach. They compare favorably with test data. Phase magnetization characteristics also have good precision and smoothness. These electromagnetic parameters were then used to assess and compare two different SRM models for the calculation of the torque on the motor shaft: the linear trapezoidal model; and the nonlinear model. The comparison between the measured torque and the torque as calculated with the two different models shows that the more simple trapezoidal model should be satisfactory in many cases, and could in particular be used in automated SRM designs.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1996.560166","publicationTitle":"IAS '96.

Based on a similar concept of the d q theory for conventional sinusoidal electric machines, this SRM with DC assisted excitation (SRDC) uses auxiliary DC windings to achieve the built-in field excitation in SRM structures. Since the field in this SRDC motor is established by the DC winding excitation, a larger percentage of the armature current is used to produce torque rather than building the field, which makes the SRDC motor have 50% higher torque density than that of the conventional SRM drive without losing performance. The detailed modeling of this SRDC motor drive, power density, machine performance comparison against conventional SRM drive and the proof of the theory by the experimental study are given in the paper. The results of this study show great potential for this technology in multiple industrial applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '96.

Of these three, predictive current control offers the potential for achieving more precise current control with minimum distortion and harmonic noise, but is generally more difficult to implement and usually must be matched to a specific load. Also, errors caused by computational delays create further problems in a real system. This paper presents algorithms for directly implementing a predictive current controller in a microprocessor for load situations where the back-EMF is both known and unknown. The algorithms fully compensate for sampling delays and discretisation errors, and are simple enough to be readily implemented in a practical system. Both simulation and experimental results are presented as confirmation of the approach presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '96.

The active filter is realized with small rated-1%-2%-of the load rating, square-wave inverters at the dominant harmonic frequencies. The controller achieves harmonic isolation even in the presence of supply voltage harmonic distortions for desired dominant harmonic frequencies such as 5/sup th/ and 7/sup th/ harmonics for six pulse rectifier loads or 11/sup th/ and 13/sup th/ for twelve pulse loads. A novel method of active filter inverter DC bus control, as proposed here, achieves power balancing by exchanging energy at the fundamental frequency and at the dominant harmonic frequency. The proposed controller directly generates inverter voltage commands and enables low switching frequency inverter implementations including square-wave inverters.

It is therefore important to ensure soft switching in the whole operating range; the penalty is a considerable worsening of converter efficiency and electromagnetic noise generation. In this paper a design approach of insulated converters with active voltage clamp is presented, which allows soft switching from no load to full load. The approach is described for the case of a flyback converter but is valid also for Sepic and Cuk topologies. Experimental results of a 100 W-300 kHz converter demonstrate the excellent performances obtained according to the proposed design procedure: switch overvoltage less than 20% of the nominal value in any operating condition and overall converter efficiency above 83% from 50% to 100% of rated load.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1996.560226","publicationTitle":"IAS '96.

This technique uses Gaussian basis functions to adaptively parameterize the data and, as a consequence, the point-scattering mechanisms and resonance phenomena can be readily separated based on the width of the Gaussian bases. The adaptive joint time-frequency ISAR algorithm is tested using data generated by the moment-method simulation of simple structures and the chamber measurement data from a scaled model airplane.

The method uses a coupled electric-field integral equation (EFIE) and magnetic-field integral equation (MFIE) formulation, referred to as the hybrid EFIE-MFIE (HEM), in which the EFIE and MFIE are applied to geometrically distinct regions of an object. The HEM is capable of modeling arbitrary three-dimensional (3-D) metallic structures, including wires and both open and closed surfaces. We show that current-based hybrid techniques that utilize physical optics (PO) are an approximation of the HEM formulation. A numerical solution procedure is given that combines the moment method (EFIE) with an iterative Neumann series technique (MFIE). This permits one to effectively utilize the PO approximation when appropriate, and provides a general and systematic mechanism to correct the errors introduced by PO. Consequently, the HEM overcomes the inherent limitations of hybrid techniques which rely upon ansatz-based improvements of PO. The method is applied to the problem of radiation from objects that can be modeled using wires and metallic surfaces as fundamental elements. A representative example is given to demonstrate that the method can handle the difficult problem of a parasitic monopole located in the deep shadow region.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/12218/00560345.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.560345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.560345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative current-based hybrid method for complex structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Optical surface waves","Optical scattering","Integral equations","Geometry","Wires","Physical optics","Moment methods","Surface waves","Diffraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","antenna radiation patterns","monopole antennas","electric fields","magnetic fields","integral equations","physical optics","approximation theory","method of moments","series (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative current based hybrid method","complex structures","antenna radiation patterns","scattering problems","electric field integral equation","magnetic field integral equation","MFIE","EFIE","hybrid EFIE-MFIE","3D metallic structures","wires","open surfaces","closed surfaces","physical optics","numerical solution","moment method","iterative Neumann series technique","PO approximation","parasitic monopole","deep shadow region","large platform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"An iterative current-based hybrid method for complex structures","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","accessionNumber":"5503948","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative current-based hybrid method for complex structures","sourcePdf":"00560345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047189S","chronDate":"Feb 1997","isNumber":"12218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"109","articleId":"560345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":560348,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

We argue that a watermark must be placed in perceptually significant components of a signal if it is to be robust to common signal distortions and malicious attack. However, it is well known that modification of these components can lead to perceptual degradation of the signal. To avoid this, we propose to insert a watermark into the spectral components of the data using techniques analogous to spread spectrum communications, hiding a narrow band signal in a wideband channel that is the data. The watermark is difficult for an attacker to remove, even when several individuals conspire together with independently watermarked copies of the data. It is also robust to common signal and geometric distortions such as digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion, resampling, quantization, dithering, compression, rotation, translation, cropping and scaling. The same digital watermarking algorithm can be applied to all three media under consideration with only minor modifications, making it especially appropriate for multimedia products. Retrieval of the watermark unambiguously identifies the owner, and the watermark can be constructed to make counterfeiting almost impossible. We present experimental results to support these claims.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12210/00560429.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"246 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure spread spectrum watermarking for images, audio and video","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Secure spread spectrum watermarking for images, audio and video","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5591051","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure spread spectrum watermarking for images, audio and video","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027203S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"256","articleId":"560429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":560435,"authors":[{"name":"U.

However, the application of rate-distortion optimization to current variable block size motion compensation (MC) systems is hampered by the fact that MV dependency introduced by the differential coding stage, e.g., the medium differential coding in the advanced prediction mode of the ITU-T standard H.263, makes the rate-distortion (R-D) optimization process extremely difficult. We propose two 1-D differential MV coding frameworks for variable block size MC systems. We show that for one of the proposed differential coding structures the optimal block sizes and the MVs can be jointly obtained by applying dynamic programming (DP) and tree-pruning techniques hierarchically without enumerating all combinations, while a near-optimal solution can be obtained for the other one by adopting a similar optimization procedure with little modification. By comparing the performance of our R-D encoding scheme with that of the H.263 test model TMN5, we find that our approaches achieve 30-60% bit-rate reductions in coding motion vectors, which results in greater than 1 dB gains within a MC hybrid coding environment for most head-and-shoulder videophone sequences under a low-bit-rate constraint.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560437","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12210/00560437.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"262 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and optimization of a differentially coded variable block size motion compensation system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560437/","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of a differentially coded variable block size motion compensation system","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5591055","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of a differentially coded variable block size motion compensation system","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030335S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"7","articleId":"560437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":560452,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Soo Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microelectronics, Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Seung-Soo Han","id":"37087291528"},{"name":"G.S.

However, model development is complicated by the fact that backpropagation neural networks contain several adjustable parameters whose optimal values are initially unknown. These include learning rate, momentum, training tolerance, and the number of hidden layer neurons. This paper investigates the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) to determine the optimal neural network parameters for modeling plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of silicon dioxide films. To find an optimal parameter set for the PECVD models, a performance matrix is defined and used in the GA objective function. This index accounts for both prediction error as well as training error, with a higher emphasis on reducing prediction error. Results of the genetic search are compared with a similar search using the simplex algorithm. The GA search performed approximately 10% better in reducing training error and 66% better in reducing prediction error.","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1996.560452","startPage":"200","endPage":"206","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/4127/12208/00560452.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1996.560452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of neural network structure and learning parameters using genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Semiconductor process modeling","Computer aided manufacturing","Virtual manufacturing","Semiconductor device manufacture","Neurons","Plasma applications","Plasma chemistry","Chemical vapor deposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","genetic algorithms","semiconductor device manufacture","backpropagation","performance index","search problems","error handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network structure optimization","learning parameter optimization","genetic algorithms","semiconductor manufacturing process model","generalization","backpropagation neural networks","adjustable parameters","learning rate","momentum","training tolerance","hidden layer neurons","plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition","silicon dioxide films","performance matrix","objective function","prediction error","genetic search","training error","simplex algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of neural network structure and learning parameters using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 1996","accessionNumber":"5437395","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of neural network structure and learning parameters using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"00560452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078268S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4127","citationCount":"4","articleId":"560452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":560464,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Il Chang","affiliation":["Image Communication Laboratory, Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Il Chang","id":"37347965800"},{"name":"Jun Seok Song","affiliation":["Image Communication Laboratory, Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun Seok Song","id":"37983586600"},{"name":"Seung Jun Lee","affiliation":["Image Communication Laboratory, Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung Jun Lee","id":"38185730500"},{"name":"Choong Woong Lee","affiliation":["Image Communication Laboratory, Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Choong Woong Lee","id":"37384513900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3259-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"560464","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Decoding","Encoding","Motion estimation","Image sequences","Delay","Entropy coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","video coding","image sequences","vectors","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion vector coding","multistage temporal motion compensation","interframe differential coding","motion vector field","residual vector fields","compensation vector field","video compression"]}],"abstract":"Motion vector field is generally encoded by using an intraframe differential coding, that is, the well known DPCM approach.

Based on this fact, dynamic coding algorithms have been designed. They try to find an optimal coding scheme for each image segment. They rely on an exhaustive search of the best coding algorithm. Evaluation of all algorithms is computationally very intensive and strongly limits the number of considered algorithms for a given application. Therefore, current standards rely on a single coding algorithm. This paper investigates a way to predict the coding quality from the image content. This prediction is based on a neural network. The coding quality is computed from image region features. Those features are easy and fast to compute, and are common to the whole set of considered coding algorithms. Therefore, the choice of the best algorithm can be based on those predicted coding qualities, and does not require the computation of all coding algorithms. The system is also fast enough to be used for dynamic bitrate allocation, and a simple algorithm to do this is proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560500/","accessionNumber":"5591075","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image quality prediction for bitrate allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image quality prediction for bitrate allocation","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027579S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"6","articleId":"560500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":560513,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The proposed vector prediction technique consists of five dedicated predictors (experts), where each expert predictor is optimized for a particular class of input vectors. An input vector is classified into one of five classes based on its directional variances. One expert is optimized for stationary blocks, and each of the other four experts are optimized to predict horizontal, vertical, 45/spl deg/, and 135/spl deg/ diagonally oriented edge-blocks, respectively. An integrating unit is then used to select or combine the outputs of the experts in order to form the final output of the modular network. Therefore, no side information is required to transmit to the receiver about the predictor selection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme gives an improvement of 1 to 1.5 dB better than a single multilayer perceptron (MLP) predictor. However, if the information about the predictor selection is sent to the receiver, the improvement could be up to 3 dB over the single MLP predictor. The perceptual quality of the predicted images is also significantly improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560523/","accessionNumber":"5591098","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A modular neural network vector predictor for predictive VQ","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modular neural network vector predictor for predictive VQ","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029901S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"4","articleId":"560523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":560534,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing & Information Systems, University of Western Ontario, Campbelltown, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Ming Zhang","id":"37087180518"},{"name":"J.

We describe a wavelet based video codec with motion compensation used to reduce temporal redundancy. The prediction error frames are encoded using an embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) approach which allows data rate scalability. Since motion compensation is used in the algorithm, the duality of the decoded video may decay due to the propagation of errors in the temporal domain. An adaptive motion compensation scheme is proposed to address this problem. We show that using our control scheme the quality of the decoded video can be maintained at any data rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560603","startPage":"69","endPage":"72 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12216/00560603.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A control scheme for a data rate scalable video codec","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"A control scheme for a data rate scalable video codec","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5572288","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560603/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A control scheme for a data rate scalable video codec","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029687S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"10","articleId":"560603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":560627,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The STARE (structured analysis of the retina) system is a sophisticated image management system that will automatically diagnose images, compare images, measure key features in images, annotate image contents, and search for images similar in content. The authors concentrate on automated diagnosis. The images are annotated by segmentation of objects of interest, classification of the extracted objects, and reasoning about the image contents. The inferencing is accomplished with Bayesian networks that learn from image examples of each disease. This effort at image understanding in fundus images anticipates the future use of medical images. As these capabilities mature, the authors expect that ophthalmologists and physicians in other fields that rely in images will use a system like STARE to reduce repetitive work, to provide assistance to physicians in difficult diagnoses or with unfamiliar diseases, and to manage images in large image databases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated diagnosis and image understanding with object extraction, object classification, and inferencing in retinal images","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560760","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12210/00560760.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"698 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Automated diagnosis and image understanding with object extraction, object classification, and inferencing in retinal images","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5595487","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated diagnosis and image understanding with object extraction, object classification, and inferencing in retinal images","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027117S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"65","articleId":"560760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":560766,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It consists of two phases: rendering and correction. The rendering phase is edge-directed. From the low resolution image data, we generate a high resolution edge map by first filtering with a rectangular center-on-surround-off filter and then performing piecewise linear interpolation between the zero crossings in the filter output. The rendering phase is based on bilinear interpolation modified to prevent interpolation across edges, as determined from the estimated high resolution edge map. During the correction phase, we modify the mesh values on which the rendering is based to account for the disparity between the true low resolution data, and that predicted by a sensor model operating on the high resolution output of the rendering phase. The overall process is repeated iteratively. We show experimental results which demonstrate the efficacy of our interpolation method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge-directed interpolation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560768","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12210/00560768.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"710 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Edge-directed interpolation","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5595490","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge-directed interpolation","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025191S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"242","articleId":"560768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":560780,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Moreover, due to the hierarchical structure of the MPEG-2 bitstream, the damage caused by channel noise depends on the position of the corrupted bit in the bitstream. Analysis shows that the most important (or most sensitive) bits are those of the MPEG-2 start codes. Loss of a start code usually causes the unrecoverable damage of an entire slice or even a whole sequence of pictures. An optimum detector for start codes is presented. In contrast to classical MPEG-2 decoders, this detector is based on the real-valued channel output (soft values), instead of already detected binary values (hard decisions). Performance analysis shows an SNR gain of about 6 dB compared to the classical hard decision detector.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560804","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12210/00560804.pdf","startPage":"751","endPage":"754 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On MPEG-2 decoding of noisy input data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"On MPEG-2 decoding of noisy input data","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5595501","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560804/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On MPEG-2 decoding of noisy input data","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03192S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"7","articleId":"560804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":560829,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Our new family of codes allows for encoding of prediction residuals at a complexity similar to that of Golomb codes, without recourse to the rough approximations used when a code designed for non-negative integers is matched to the encoding of any integer.

Five islands formed with controlled and uncontrolled load shedding, uncontrolled generation tripping, and with a blackout in Southern Idaho. The Western power system is operated by power companies belonging to the Western Systems Coordinating Council, which had a peak 1996 summer load of around 118,000 MW. July 2 was the third and, until the August 10 large-scale power failure, the most disruptive of a series of Western system breakups. The first was caused by the January 17, 1994, Northridge California earthquake. The second breakup occurred in the early morning hours of December 14, 1994, and, like July 2, originated in Southern Idaho and Wyoming. Modern computer and communication technologies greatly facilitated dissemination of information, analysis, report writing and event simulation for the July 2 cascading outage. This article analyzes the breakup, relying heavily on recordings from portable power system monitors which are installed at key locations and serve as primary components of a wide-area measurement system project.","doi":"10.1109/67.560830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel3/67/12213/00560830.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.560830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recording and analyzing the July 2 cascading outage [Western USA power system]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","displayDocTitle":"Recording and analyzing the July 2 cascading outage [Western USA power system]","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5488095","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recording and analyzing the July 2 cascading outage [Western USA power system]","sourcePdf":"00560830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060086S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"117","articleId":"560830","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":560833,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is often the case that adaptive quantization is achieved by defining a discrete set of quantizers from which one is chosen for a given set of coefficients. This type of forward adaptation thus requires that overhead information (the choice of quantizer) be sent to the decoder. Then, the quantized coefficients are transmitted using adaptive entropy coding, typically through backward adaptive arithmetic coding. We show that a combination of forward and backward adaptation methods can be used to update the quantizers thus reducing the overhead requirements while still providing good performance. Specifically, we present an algorithm where each coefficient is classified into several classes based on the past quantized data and where the quantizer to be used for each class can itself be adapted on the fly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560833/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5577277","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive quantization of image subbands with efficient overhead rate selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive quantization of image subbands with efficient overhead rate selection","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560833.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042081S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"10","articleId":"560833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":560835,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In particular, fast algorithms for finding best bases in an operational rate-distortion sense have been successfully used in image coding. Independently of this work, recent research has also explored the design of filter banks that optimize energy compaction for a single signal or a class of signals. In this paper we integrate these two different but complementary approaches to best-basis design and propose an image coder in which subband filter banks, tree structure and quantizers are chosen so as to optimize rate-distortion performance. These optimal filter banks, tree structure and quantizers represent side information. They are selected from a codebook designed from training data, using a rate-distortion criterion.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12216","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12216/00560835.pdf","endPage":"372 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transform image coding based on joint adaptation of filter banks and tree structures","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560835","startPage":"369","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Transform image coding based on joint adaptation of filter banks and tree structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560835/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5577279","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transform image coding based on joint adaptation of filter banks and tree structures","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037024S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"6","articleId":"560835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":560837,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

For each 16/spl times/16 macroblock, the encoder accumulates a metric representing the vulnerability to channel errors. As each new frame is encoded, the accumulated metric for each block is examined, and those blocks deemed to have an unacceptably high metric are sent using intra as opposed to inter coding.

We show that using this strategy, transmission of video over very noisy channels still renders acceptable visual quality, and outperforms schemes that use equal error protection only.

The detection is based on the pixel intensities recorded by each tracking block. The asymptotic probability that any pixel in the image plane is covered by some tracking blocks is shown to be l-e/sup -1/. The performance is analyzed and is fairly high. The results of simulation tests confirm to the theoretical analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4140/12210/00560856.pdf","startPage":"799","endPage":"802 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1996.560856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1996.560856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking and detection of moving point targets in noise image sequences by local maximum likelihood","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Target tracking","Image sequences","Pixel","Trajectory","Detection algorithms","Performance analysis","Gaussian noise","Signal to noise ratio","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise","image sequences","target tracking","maximum likelihood detection","motion estimation","image segmentation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving point targets","target detection","target tracking","noisy image sequences","local maximum likelihood","tracking blocks","maximum velocity","tracking block","pixel intensity","image region","asymptotic probability","performance analysis","simulation tests"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Tracking and detection of moving point targets in noise image sequences by local maximum likelihood","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5591153","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-19 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking and detection of moving point targets in noise image sequences by local maximum likelihood","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00560856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096247S","chronDate":"16-19 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4140","citationCount":"2","articleId":"560856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":560868,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

This article features PowerWorld, a comprehensive power system simulation package developed to help meet this need. The package is designed for the many new players in the power industry who will never operate an actual system but who must have a basic understanding of its operations. The package, which runs in the Microsoft Windows environment, is user friendly, interactive, and menu driven. It effectively uses visualization techniques to present the basics of power system operations and control simply, yet also with a level of detail to accurately model large-scale systems realistically and with the appropriate level of fidelity. The package has been demonstrated to policy makers, legislative analysts, small and large utilities, and regulatory decision makers both nationally and internationally. It has been found to be a very effective tool for communicating the many technical and economic impacts of third-party access.","doi":"10.1109/67.560868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel3/67/12213/00560868.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.560868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12213","startPage":"53","endPage":"58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualizing power system operations in an open market","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=560868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visualizing power system operations in an open market","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/560868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5488100","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualizing power system operations in an open market","sourcePdf":"00560868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023562S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"37","articleId":"560868","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":560871,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A test with seventy images shows an extraction rate of 92.8%, working well within real world situations.

Furthermore TCQ can be incorporated into a transform coding structure (such as the discrete cosine transform) for encoding monochrome and color images with fixed rate or entropy-constrained schemes. In all these cases an expanded codebook is partitioned into subsets used to label the branches of an appropriate graph (trellis). For a given data sequence, the Viterbi algorithm is then used to find the minimum mean square error path through the trellis. We present a generic architecture scheme that can be easily adapted to the different TCQ image compression methods.

For example, terrain and distances may preclude VHF/UHF line-of-sight communications, yet the HF environment may prove unsatisfactory from too many users in a limited bandwidth or intentional jamming. HF propagation, while favorable for over-the-horizon operations, allows relatively easy communications interception. The Correlated Hopping Enhanced Spread Spectrum (CHESS) waveform is introduced as an improved approach to high-speed, HF digital communications. In general terms, frequency hopping (FH) avoids narrowband interference better than direct sequence (DS) spread spectrum. CHESS improves upon current FH systems with a much shorter frequency dwell, and it does not modulate each hopped pulse. As a result, users sharing the spectrum with CHESS are less likely to experience adjacent or co-channel interference. Moreover, CHESS uses a differential frequency hopping (DFH) technique to encode data, which permits reconstruction of hops missed in the detection process. This error correction is over and above other methods that may be applied. The result is an exceptionally robust, low error rate communications system. Tests have yielded excellent bit error rates at up to 19.2 kbps over short- and long-haul propagation paths. The system uses relatively simple hardware. Essentially, an unmodulated direct digital synthesizer serves as a transmitter, and a fast Fourier transform card detects the signal. Digital signal processing as well as ADC and DAC form the basis of system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.1996.561099","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 Tactical Communications Conference.

This paper specifically discusses the implementation of these improvements in the radios. First, it discusses the implementation of Reed-Solomon forward error correction to increase throughput while improving range and significantly improving the interference protection of the radio against cosite and jamming. The discussion includes the investigation of several coding approaches and implementations, and the results of the analysis which led to the selection of a family of the Reed-Solomon codes. The second area of discussion is the implementation of a new frequency hopping waveform that increases the probability of synchronization and reduces transmission overhead. Thirdly, the implementation of an improved channel access algorithm that allows mixed voice and packet data operation on a common net with minimal impact of voice operation at high packet data throughput rates is discussed. In addition, the implementation of an efficient data interface, per MIL-STD-188-220 A, to ITT's Internet controller (INC) which provides for packet radio relay nodes across the battlefield is discussed. Finally, the implementation of the embedded GPS position information, and user ID, in voice and data messages to provide reporting of friendly force positions for situation awareness is discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Reed-Solomon codes","Forward error correction","Interference","Protection","Jamming","Frequency synchronization","Internet","Radio control","Packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military communication","forward error correction","Reed-Solomon codes","jamming","frequency hop communication","packet radio networks","data communication","voice communication","Global Positioning System","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SINCGARS system improvement program","airborne radios","ground radios","position awareness","data throughput","battlefield","Reed-Solomon forward error correction","range","jamming","frequency hopping waveform","synchronization probability","transmission overhead reduction","channel access algorithm","packet data operation","voice operation","high packet data throughput rates","data interface","MIL-STD-188-220 A","ITT Internet controller","packet radio relay nodes","embedded GPS position information","user ID"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=561109","doi":"10.1109/TCC.1996.561109","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 Tactical Communications Conference.

Reward and penalty functions are applied to it in order to emphasize environmental, economic, security, robustness, public policy and other considerations as they are predetermined by the philosophy of operation of the electric utility. These considerations (policies) become a part of the training set and operation of the neural network. The fitness function used by the genetic algorithm in order to rank the possible solutions is based on a load flow program. The binary nature of the genetic algorithm is particularly appropriate for the operation of switches. The result of the methodology is the equivalent of an online implicit load flow program used to redesign the configuration of the power system in real-time by opening and closing critical switches that are placed along the power system.

The authors have been involved for several years with the effort to develop procedures and standards for evaluating the EMC of ICs. One of these standards, SAE J1752/3, is being used by the IC industry to characterize high speed VLSI ICs and survey the variation of RF emissions due to changes in IC process and package parameters. This standard specifies a radiated emissions measurement system using a 1 GHz TEM cell with the IC under test on a test board that is a part of the wall above the septum of the TEM cell. In order to investigate the theoretical basis for this procedure, a model of the IC lead frame as a current loop was developed and analyzed for coupling to the septum of the TEM cell at different orientations. Test boards with current loops orientated both parallel and orthogonal to the TEM cell wall were evaluated for correlation with the model. Using a microprocessor on a test board, a comparison was made of the measured data from the 1 GHz TEM cell, the EMSCANTM circuit board analysis system and radiated field measurements using an antenna. Methods for calibration of the TEM cell were also investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/561202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Aug 1996","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"19-23 Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5545198","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the theoretical basis for using a 1 GHz TEM cell to evaluate the radiated emissions from integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the theoretical basis for using a 1 GHz TEM cell to evaluate the radiated emissions from integrated circuits","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00561202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033599S","chronDate":"19-23 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4031","citationCount":"21","articleId":"561202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":561211,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

The emission of EM noise depends on the transmission line structure and ground structure including the connection between the system ground (SG) and frame ground (FG). We applied the 3D-FEM analysis to the design of a thin film transistor liquid crystal display's (TFT-LCD) PCB. The calculation results were confirmed by experiments using model transmission lines. The 360 MHz noise emission from a strip line structure is about 1/10 of that from a microstrip line structure for a particular specification. Plural FGs generate loop currents and increase the noise emission. The distance between the noise source and FG is an important factor in deciding the noise emission.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1996.561255","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel3/4031/12221/00561255.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.1996.561255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D-FEM analysis of electromagnetic emission from PCB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=561255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/561255/","displayDocTitle":"3D-FEM analysis of electromagnetic emission from PCB","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5533190","conferenceDate":"19-23 Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-FEM analysis of electromagnetic emission from PCB","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00561255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049883S","chronDate":"19-23 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4031","citationCount":"2","articleId":"561255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":561261,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Shape modeling is a very important issue for shape recognition for robot vision, representing 3D shapes in the virtual world, and so on. Superquadrics are often used for shape modeling because they can represent various shapes by using a single equation. In this paper, we propose a new method for applying GAs to estimation of the superquadrics parameters of every objects in a shading image which are taken with a CCD camera. The superquadrics parameters are represented by strings. The string is evaluated by the similarity between the given 2D shading image and the calculated shading image from the 3D shape represented by the parameters. For finding the model parameters of each object in the image, sharing scheme is employed so that multiple solutions can be held in the population of the strings. Some results of the computer experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide good model descriptions of the 3D object in shading images.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.561290","startPage":"2463","endPage":"2468 vol.4","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

In this model, we use cache genetic algorithm to generate the possible patterns of the structure and the parameters directly for the MFNN. Using the proposed cache genetic algorithm, small population can be held to speed up the genetic process from cache pool and keep chromosomes fresh by extracting new blood from auxiliary pool. A modular fuzzy neural network is able to learn the set of simpler functions faster than a multilayer perceptron can learn the undecomposed function in complex systems. Combined with the cache genetic algorithm and the modular neural network to synthesize the fuzzy logic controller, the performance is better than usual fuzzy neural networks. We use the proposed model to solve the problem of the robot path planning and compare it with the other methods to realize its performance by considering four factors: safety factor, smoothness factor, length factor, and time factor. Experiments results show the proposed model is superior than other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.561478","startPage":"3089","endPage":"3094 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

By enforcing a \"reuse distance\" similar to the frequency reuse factor in AMPS cellular service, we can route and assign channels to (place) arriving calls in a peer-to-peer network so as to significantly reduce power requirements and interference.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4062/12222/00562623.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"502 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12222","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=562623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing and channel assignment for low power transmission in PCS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Power transmission","Personal communication networks","Spread spectrum communication","Bandwidth","Centralized control","Communication system control","Frequency","Cellular networks","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network routing","personal communication networks","self-adjusting systems","frequency hop communication","interference suppression","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","frequency allocation","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel assignment","routing","low power transmission","PCS","self-organization networks","multi-hop communications","fixed bandwidth","reuse distance","frequency reuse factor","AMPS cellular service","peer-to-peer network","power requirements","interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Routing and channel assignment for low power transmission in PCS","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5545322","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing and channel assignment for low power transmission in PCS","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00562623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0373S","chronDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062","citationCount":"105","articleId":"562623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":562640,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong Woo Lim","affiliation":["R&D Center, Shinsegi Telecomm, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeong Woo Lim","id":"37347275000"},{"name":"Ji Cheol Park","affiliation":["R&D Center, Shinsegi Telecomm, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ji Cheol Park","id":"38256806500"},{"name":"Dong Geun Jeong","affiliation":["R&D Center, Shinsegi Telecomm, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Geun Jeong","id":"37274431000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3300-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"562640","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Multiaccess communication","Cellular networks","Personal communication networks","Protocols","Mobile handsets","Distributed control","Costs","Portable computers","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cellular radio","data communication","land mobile radio","personal communication networks","digital radio","packet radio networks","facsimile","data communication equipment","telecommunication terminals","telephone sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless data services","CDMA cellular","PCS networks","digital cellular systems","personal communications services","asynchronous/fax data service","protocol stacks","data terminals","mobile phones","packet data service","UHF","800 MHz","1.8 to 2 GHz"]}],"abstract":"We consider the implementation issues of incorporating data service features into CDMA digital cellular systems (DCS), using the 800 MHz band, and personal communications services (PCS) networks, using the 1.8 GHz band.

In this paper the basic ideas of the integrated broadband mobile system (IBMS), supporting in a unified way a variety of communication classes ranging from high mobility with low data rates towards quasi-stationarity at high data rates, are presented. The key feature of this proposal is a closed system approach for both outdoor and indoor environment. Essential is the use of a single common, low bit-rate, generally available signalling channel for negotiation of the required service class or supporting the fallback to a lower service class if necessary. In the outdoor area, the use of smart antennas with strongly sectorized coverage will support high bit rates on behalf of reduced mobility speed, while simultaneously assuring efficient use of frequency spectrum. The same signalling channel will also be used to coordinate possible change of the mobile terminal to and forth between the outdoor provision and space limited indoor domains, operating on the picocell principle. Mobile terminals can be designed in a modular way to support all, or only some lower, bit rates. IBMS allows for an evolutionary extension starting from the infrastructure of today's digital cellular systems towards a multimedia and multiservice support of future universal personal communications using an ATM based communication backbone. IBMS is a joint research effort of Dresden University of Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Technical University of Berlin, and the Heinrich-Heaz-Institute Berlin sponsored by the German federal ministry of education, science, research and technology (BMBF) within the project line ATMmobil.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562665/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5551964","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A closed solution for an integrated broadband mobile system (IBMS)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A closed solution for an integrated broadband mobile system (IBMS)","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00562665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046164S","chronDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062","citationCount":"7","articleId":"562665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":562668,"authors":[{"name":"Seunghyeon Nahm","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seunghyeon Nahm","id":"37348872500"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wonyong Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3300-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"562668","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Spread spectrum communication","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Uncertainty","Probability distribution","Filters","Costs","Timing","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","quantisation (signal)","code division multiple access","stochastic processes","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acquisition performance","direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA","DS-SS CDMA","limited wordlength effects","quantization effects","hardware implementation","signal dependent distortion","optimum saturation limit","low-cost digital system implementations","system performance"]}],"abstract":"The effects of a limited wordlength and the saturation for the hardware implementation of direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA systems are stochastically analyzed.

Feedforward, though, requires automatic adaptation of key parameters for reliable distortion cancellation as operating conditions vary. With a novel and appropriate use of DSP, we have implemented a feedforward linearizer with adaptation driven by easily computed gradient signals. This overcomes the difficulties, such as DC offsets at the output of analog mixers and masking of weak signals by stronger ones, that slow and/or cause incorrect convergence of many previously reported implementations. The result is an average of 40 dB reduction in intermodulation spectra over a wide bandwidth, with extremely fast tracking.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562683","startPage":"788","endPage":"792 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4062/12222/00562683.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DSP controlled adaptive feedforward amplifier linearizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A DSP controlled adaptive feedforward amplifier linearizer","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5551981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562683/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSP controlled adaptive feedforward amplifier linearizer","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00562683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032426S","chronDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062","citationCount":"24","articleId":"562683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":562685,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Mo Koo","affiliation":["System Development Team, PCS Business Development Division, Korea Mobile Telecom, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun Mo Koo","id":"37345362400"},{"name":"Young Il Kim","affiliation":["System Development Team, PCS Business Development Division, Korea Mobile Telecom, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Il Kim","id":"38255750200"},{"name":"Jae Hwang Ryu","affiliation":["System Development Team, PCS Business Development Division, Korea Mobile Telecom, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Hwang Ryu","id":"38255661300"},{"name":"Jin Ick Lee","affiliation":["System Development Team, PCS Business Development Division, Korea Mobile Telecom, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Ick Lee","id":"37350934300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3300-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"562685","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Computer aided instruction","Telecommunications","Personal communication networks","Software prototyping","Protocols","Application specific integrated circuits","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","broadband networks","network interfaces","application specific integrated circuits","personal communication networks","land mobile radio","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prototype wideband CDMA system","common air interface protocol","system development","wideband CDMA ASIC","software implementation","hardware implementation","experimental results","cellular radio","PCS service","Korea Mobile Telecom"]}],"abstract":"Wideband CDMA technology has been investigated by Korea Mobile Telecom for the next generation PCS service.

Because the demand for land mobile communications is increasing rapidly, multi-level modulations have recently been drawing much attention. Although some field experiments using 16 QAM and time division multiple access (TDMA) have been made and some applications proposed, we have concluded that 16 QAM is suitable to be used for indoor communications because the delay spreads and the maximum Doppler frequencies in indoor environments are generally smaller than those in the outdoor environments. Consequently, we have designed this modem for wireless LANs on the ISM band which is one of the applications of indoor communications. From the simulations, we found that the frame error rate vs. signal to noise ratio curve of this modem was about 3 dB degraded compared with the theoretical one.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562690","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4062/12222/00562690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12222","startPage":"818","endPage":"821 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"16 QAM digital modem for indoor wireless packet communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=562690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"16 QAM digital modem for indoor wireless packet communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562690/","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5551987","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16 QAM digital modem for indoor wireless packet communications","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00562690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031366S","chronDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062","citationCount":"1","articleId":"562690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":562692,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

Eng., Queen's University, Kingston) that the asymptotic SNR loss in the capacity, relative to the AWGN channel, for ideal Rayleigh fading is no more than 2.51 dB, which is not very dramatic. By looking at the reliability function, we have found, on the other hand, that the loss in the cutoff rate due to Rayleigh fading is monotonically increasing with SNR and considerably longer codes are required for transmission over the Rayleigh channel at rates below capacity. Nevertheless, this loss can be regained by means of diversity, where it has been found that most of the loss can be reclaimed with the use of 2 or 3 antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562703","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC - 5th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4062/12222/00562703.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1996.562703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12222","startPage":"886","endPage":"890 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The information theoretic reliability function for multipath fading channels with diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=562703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The information theoretic reliability function for multipath fading channels with diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562703/","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5552000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The information theoretic reliability function for multipath fading channels with diversity","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00562703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035988S","chronDate":"29 Sep-2 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062","citationCount":"2","articleId":"562703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":562713,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyi Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Hongyi Liang","id":"37345151400"},{"name":"V.C.M.

All of these methods result in a considerable reduction in the complexity of VLSI implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ICASIC.1996.562741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASIC.1996.562741","publicationTitle":"2nd International Conference on ASIC","displayPublicationTitle":"2nd International Conference on ASIC","pdfPath":"/iel3/4267/12233/00562741.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A vector quantization algorithm suitable for VLSI implementation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5565644","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector quantization algorithm suitable for VLSI implementation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"00562741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02735S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267","articleId":"562741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":562751,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Institute, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jing Li","id":"37350625100"},{"name":"Bao-Sheng Hu","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Institute, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Bao-Sheng Hu","id":"37289807300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5439-0940-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"562751","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes","Control systems","Three-term control","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Signal processing algorithms","Very large scale integration","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","three-term control","gain control","field programmable gate arrays","process control","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy PID gain conditioner","FPGA prototype implementation","process control","FPGC","VLSI structure","virtual control system"]}],"abstract":"Tuning the parameters of PID controller is very important in process control.

However, existing FPGAs on the market all implement general purpose logic designs. They are not well defined for the coprocessing and codesign purpose. In this paper, an analysis and comparison of existing FPGA architectures against requirements from synthesis process on algorithm specifications is described. Based on this analysis, the design of a configurable ASynchronous Array Processor (ASAP) and the development of a data-driven multiple thread computation model for the processor are presented. The system's performance is data dependent and measured by average instead of worst cases in synchronous FPGAs. The ASAP easily out-performs other coprocessing systems as a frame buffer by embedding a fast forward difference polynomial evaluation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICASIC.1996.562774","publicationTitle":"2nd International Conference on ASIC","displayPublicationTitle":"2nd International Conference on ASIC","pdfPath":"/iel3/4267/12233/00562774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASIC.1996.562774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12233","startPage":"151","endPage":"154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASAP: an asynchronous array processor for hardware-software coprocessing and codesign","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=562774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ASAP: an asynchronous array processor for hardware-software coprocessing and codesign","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562774/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5565677","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASAP: an asynchronous array processor for hardware-software coprocessing and codesign","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"00562774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033162S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267","articleId":"562774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":562779,"authors":[{"name":"Weixin Gai","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Weixin Gai","id":"37342841700"},{"name":"Hongyi Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hongyi Chen","id":"37281176500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5439-0940-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"562779","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=562779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Frequency","Pipelines","Nearest neighbor searches","Flip-flops","Costs","Systolic arrays","Very large scale integration","Kernel","Public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","VLSI","CMOS logic circuits","multiplying circuits","systolic arrays","pipeline arithmetic","public key cryptography","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic linear array","modular multiplication","pipeline stage","nearest neighbour communication","high clock frequency","full adder","flip-flops","area efficient system","VLSI implementation","modular exponentiation","public-key cryptosystems","RSA","CMOS processing","200 MHz","0.8 micron","64 kbit/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASIC.1996.562779","endPage":"174","startPage":"171","publicationTitle":"2nd International Conference on ASIC","displayPublicationTitle":"2nd International Conference on ASIC","pdfPath":"/iel3/4267/12233/00562779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASIC.1996.562779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systolic linear array for modular multiplication","abstract":"In this paper, a novel systolic, linear-array modular multiplier is presented which ideally performs the algorithm of P.L.

With only one full adding in one pipeline stage and the purely nearest neighbor communication, it can operate at a high clock frequency. On the other hand, every processing element is simple, mainly consisting of one full adder and five flip-flops. For n-bit modular multiplication, the cost of implementation is 29n gates. So our designed systolic array for modular multiplication is a speed and area efficient system suitable for the VLSI implementation of modular exponentiation which is a kernel operation used in many public-key cryptosystems such as RSA. With clock frequency of 200 megahertz which is practical in 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS processing, the throughput can be 64k bits per second.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/562779/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5565682","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A systolic linear array for modular multiplication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systolic linear array for modular multiplication","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"00562779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044819S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267","citationCount":"1","articleId":"562779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":562790,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engmeering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianxin Wang","id":"37351084900"},{"name":"Zaiwang Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engmeering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zaiwang Dong","id":"37334035400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5439-0940-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"562790","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Testing","Viterbi algorithm","Convolutional codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Channel coding","Streaming media","Convolution","Digital audio broadcasting","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","application specific integrated circuits","digital audio broadcasting","multipath channels","channel coding","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","channel decoder","DAB test receiver","digital audio broadcasting","CD-quality sound","flexible data services","multipath environment","channel coding","modulation scheme","program selection","time de-interleaving","null symbol insertion","punctured bit-stream","Viterbi decoding"]}],"abstract":"The Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) system promises to provide CD-quality sounds and flexible data services to mobile, portable and fixed receivers.

Windowing is a technique used to mitigate the head of line blocking by relaxing the strict first-in-first-out queuing discipline of the input buffers.

The system takes the form of a cellular array the basic element of which is a sequential synchronous full adder. The proposed system is used to build a very high speed digital filter. The execution time of any term A/sub i/.X/sub i/ (i=0, 1, ..., N) of the digital filter equation is the time of three clock cycles. The time is constant and completely independent on the word length. The basic element of the proposed array consists of two flip-flops. The analysis of the logic capabilities of the flip-flop showed that it is possible to implement any of the sixteen possible functions of two variables directly in the flip-flop. The next state of the flip-flop represents the result of the logic function. The two flip-flops of the basic element are used to realise the function of the single-bit full adder, one to form the sum S and the other to form the carry C/sub i/, where: S=X/spl oplus/Y/spl oplus/C/sub i-1/, and C/sub i/=X.Y+(X~+Y~).C/sub i-1/ The complete hardware of the basic element, the cellular array and that of the digital filter are given. The new cellular array results in great saving in the computation time compared with the conventional techniques. A comparison is given between this new hardware and the conventional ones based on the time-hardware product as a criterion. The comparison proved that the new hardware reduces the time-hardware product.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New cellular array for the hardware implementation of very high speed digital filter","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

It is shown to be more efficient in terms of computational load requirements as compared to the least mean squares (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS) approaches or the linear solution using direct matrix inversion or solutions employing matrix decomposition algorithms such as Cholesky decomposition. The computational load of the ILTE approach is shown to be less than 1% that required when the taps are derived using iterative techniques such as LMS or RLS and of less than 5% that required when using direct matrix inversion to solve the equalisation linear equation problem. The significance of the results is seen when the technique is applied in distributed ad-hoc type digital radio networks where a channel has to be estimated and equalised on a packet-by-packet basis without buffering the received packets. Examples of equalisation of typical minimum and non-minimum phase three-ray channels using the technique are presented and show a good error rate performance with the PI/4 DQPSK detector. The ILTE method, which is based on inverse filter modelling, is compared with linear solution based on Cholesky decomposition and shown to perform much better in both minimum and non-minimum phase channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non iterative channel estimation and equalisation strategy for burst /spl pi//4 DQPSK transmission","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

Using geometrical arguments and a standard propagation model, all relevant contributions to the carrier-to-interference ratios (CIR) for the uplinks of the GSM and CDMA systems are numerically evaluated. Adapting standard limits for the CIRs, the capacity on the uplink can be increased by a factor of 4.8.

The UMTS therefore requires a balanced hybrid multiple access scheme. This paper presents an attempt to combine the F/TDMA and F/CDMA advantages in F/T/CDMA which facilitates a favourably high economical efficiency, regarding the investments of future network operators, as well as high channel efficiencies, in terms of a high number of traffic channels per transceiver. F/T/CDMA thus leads to a low number of small base stations (BSs) and a high spectral efficiency by dense frequency reuse. Furthermore, F/T/CDMA allows backward compatibility with GSM. The paper explains the basic relations of mobile radio systems in regard to spectral efficiency, economical efficiency and multiple access schemes as well as the most important ETSI-UMTS requirements. A novel approach to assessing F/T/CDMA by means of joint detection (JD) techniques, termed JD-CDMA, is presented.

It allows the use of mobile-transparent hand-off, a hand-off method which does not require sending a control signal to a mobile for its initiation. This reduces the hand-off related signaling overhead, therefore makes non-orthogonal forward links well suited to micro-cellular systems where there will be frequent hand-offs. Comparing with orthogonal forward links, it also allow much more flexibility in data rates and channel coding rates, hence readily accommodate high bit rate or VBR services. In addition, the possibility of using low-rate error control codes in non-orthogonal links provides a way to compensate for the loss in capacity due to non-orthogonality. Simulation results show that when the flexibility in error control coding is exploited, orthogonal and non-orthogonal forward links have comparable capacities in Rayleigh fading channels. In static channels (or very slowly fading Rician channels), orthogonal forward links have higher capacities, but the capacities of non-orthogonal forward links are not much worse than those of orthogonal forward links when the path loss exponent is small.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563183","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12242/00563183.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"534 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-orthogonal CDMA forward link offers flexibility without compromising capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563183/","displayDocTitle":"Non-orthogonal CDMA forward link offers flexibility without compromising capacity","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5630074","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-orthogonal CDMA forward link offers flexibility without compromising capacity","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041387S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"3","articleId":"563183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":563184,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An asynchronous DS/CDMA system with a multi-user receiver is modeled as a multi-dimensional or multi-input/out system with cross-coupling that is co-channel interference. From the system model it is shown that the multi-user detection is reduced to a problem of multi-dimensional equalization for multiaccess interference as well as intersymbol interference. The proposed multi-user equalizer can improve the equalizing error of the filter, compared with that of the multidimensional FIR transversal filter of which the number of taps is finite. The multi-dimensional lattice filter can adaptively achieve fast and stable convergence with less taps. Since the filter can resolve a correlative multiple input into an orthogonal output stage by stage, the CCI can be removed.

Simulation results related to the proposed multirate multiuser scheme are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12242/00563188.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"560 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible multirate CDMA concept with multiuser detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection","Modulation coding","Telecommunication standards","Bit error rate","GSM","Speech","3G mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","channel capacity","cellular radio","signal detection","encoding","multiplexing","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirate CDMA","multiuser detection","multirate coding","multirate modulation","third generation wireless communication systems","code division multiple access","flexible coding method","multiple services","service quality requirements","multiplexing","data rate","cellular radio","variable data rates","simulation results","multirate multiuser scheme","GSM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"A flexible multirate CDMA concept with multiuser detection","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637429","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible multirate CDMA concept with multiuser detection","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047912S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"2","articleId":"563188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":563189,"authors":[{"name":"Wai Ho Mow","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Univerist\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"lastName":"Wai Ho Mow","id":"37271223800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3567-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"563189","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Multiaccess communication","Code division multiplexing","Performance analysis","Design optimization","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","minimisation","synchronisation","matrix algebra","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","binary sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst-case interuser interference","interference minimization","CDMA systems","matrix approach","signature sequences","synchronous CDMA","matrix notation","sequence design problem","orthogonal coding","optimal sequence sets","asynchronous CDMA","SNR performance"]}],"abstract":"The problem of designing signature sequences that minimize the worst-case interuser interference experienced by any user in CDMA systems is traditionally considered to be a very important but difficult problem. The problem for synchronous CDMA was recently solved by Massey and Mittelholzer (1993). We show that their results can be derived in a simple way by properly applying the matrix notation. This matrix approach is used to solve the sequence design problem for synchronous CDMA with orthogonal coding, and a necessary and sufficient condition for optimal sequence sets is obtained for the first time. It turns out that optimal sequence sets are very easy to construct. The method is then applied to solve the sequence design problem for asynchronous CDMA in a simple way. This last result was previously used to explain why so many famous sequence sets possess very similar SNR performance. For the above three CDMA systems, the optimal sequence sets not only minimize the worst-case interuser interference, but also ensure that the interuser interference experienced by every user is (nearly) the same-the uniformly good property. However, the results also indicate that the conventional SNR measures, if used as the sole performance criterion, are insufficient.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563189","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12242/00563189.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"565 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing the worst-case interuser interference experienced by any user in CDMA systems: a matrix approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563189/","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the worst-case interuser interference experienced by any user in CDMA systems: a matrix approach","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637430","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the worst-case interuser interference experienced by any user in CDMA systems: a matrix approach","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098318S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"10","articleId":"563189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":563190,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We will cover in this overview article some aspects of FEC channel coding in CDMA systems: CDMA/FEC systems can be viewed as concatenated schemes with inner and outer decoding. We will show how such a system can be improved by using a soft-in/soft-out decoder which transfers a soft decision from the inner to the outer decoder. Further improvement is gained by using another soft-in/soft-out decoder for the outer code. In an iteration the soft values of the outer code bits are then used as a priori values for the inner CDMA decoder/despreader. This can he supplemented by soft decoded bits from the other users' outer decoder similar to an interference cancellation scheme. Applications to the IS 95 system with Hadamard codes show a remarkable gain from the soft-output and from the iterations. 'Turbo' decoding of two and more dimensional product-like codes with iterative decoding using 'soft-in/soft-out' decoders achieves almost channel capacity. We extend this concept to CDMA systems with PN spreading sequences where FEC coding in one dimension is performed in the time direction and FEC coding in the other dimension is performed by a systematic code in the CDMA code direction. The parity bits of this code are transmitted by extra CDMA codes. The additional interference degradation caused hereby is outweighted by the extra FEC coding gain achieved by iterative decoding.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563190","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12242/00563190.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"569 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward error correcting for CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Forward error correcting for CDMA systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5637431","volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward error correcting for CDMA systems","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057691S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"78","articleId":"563190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":563191,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Furthermore, the DS-CDMA system is a flexible system which can accommodate various user rates easily. As many user will occupy the same frequency band simultaneously, the traffic capacity of a DS-CDMA system is determined by the interference power. Interference cancellation is one of the important techniques in decreasing the interference power and increasing the traffic capacity. We propose the delayed symbol combining interference canceller which can suppress the interference from various users sending at different information rates. Its performance is calculated by computer simulations from the viewpoint of bit-error-rate (BER). In the flat fading environment, it is found that the E/sub b//N/sub o/ degradation by the interference is suppressed to 3 dB at a BER of 10/sup -3/ with 24 users. In the frequency selective fading environment, it is found that the required E/sub b//N/sub o/ of the frequency selective fading canceller is about 11 dB better than that of the flat fading canceller to establish the BER of 10/sup -3/.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The delayed symbol combining interference canceller for multi-rate DS-CDMA","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563197","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12242/00563197.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"603 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"The delayed symbol combining interference canceller for multi-rate DS-CDMA","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637438","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The delayed symbol combining interference canceller for multi-rate DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029353S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"1","articleId":"563197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":563198,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The users in the same cell are separated by the classical CTDMA scheme (which assigns one single spreading sequence to all users of the same cell), while the users in adjacent cells are separated by the use of different cell-specific spreading sequences. The construction of these sequence sets is the main topic of this paper. Requirements on these sets can be derived from intra-and intercell interference parameters that determine the signal-to-interference ratio. It is shown that EACF sequence sets, i.e., sequence sets that yield equal aperiodic autocorrelation functions, provide an optimum intra- and intercell performance in a least square sense, They are compared with the code frequency division multiple access (CFDMA) cell separation technique, which offers more sequences on the price of a diminished intercell performance.

The parametric form of the data is known via the knowledge of the chip sequences but the number of parameters (number of delays) is unknown, because total number of paths is unknown. A number of techniques for model order estimation have been proposed in the literature. Information-theoretic techniques are computationally costly or have modest performance. Methods based on singular value analysis often yield sub-optimal result and sometimes require selection of predetermined thresholds. We introduce a new approach for model order and parameter estimation. In the new method, different signal subspaces are compared to the test subspace using the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) estimator. The proposed method is simpler and more efficient than the popular information-theoretic minimum description length (MDL) criterion in the CDMA application.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563213","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12242/00563213.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"692 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A subspace method for model order estimation in CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563213/","displayDocTitle":"A subspace method for model order estimation in CDMA","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637454","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A subspace method for model order estimation in CDMA","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025785S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"5","articleId":"563213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563215,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A new type of SAW device for the spread spectrum (SS) transceiver and a low-loss SAW matched filter for the wireless LAN system is described. Two matched filters which correspond to bi-phase data modulation and bandpass filters for the intermediate frequency (IF) section are combined into one device. This SAW matched filter fabricated on ST cut quartz has been practically used in commercial wireless LAN systems and has good temperature stability. To reduce the conversion loss further we have developed an extremely low loss SAW matched filter. The output correlation peak of the matched filter is 3 dB larger than the input level at a 50 /spl Omega/ input and output impedance. This low loss SAW matched filter is fabricated on 128/spl deg/ Y-X LiNbO/sub 3/ substrate and consists of unidirectional transducers. The phase error caused by the temperature coefficient of delay is compensated by using a temperature dependent change of local frequency in the spread spectrum receiver.

It is found that spreading sequences of variable-period are useful in such image transmissions through CDMA channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563230","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12242/00563230.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12242","startPage":"781","endPage":"784 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image transmission systems through CDMA channels using spreading sequences of variable-period","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image transmission systems through CDMA channels using spreading sequences of variable-period","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563230/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637471","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image transmission systems through CDMA channels using spreading sequences of variable-period","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050591S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"3","articleId":"563230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":563233,"authors":[{"name":"G.

There is wide interest in the quantitative retrieval of water vapor, cloud liquid, and ice using brightness temperature observations in scientific studies such as Earth's radiation budget and microphysical processes of winter and summer clouds. Emission and scattering characteristics of hydrometeors depend on the frequency of observation. Thus, a multifrequency radiometer has the capability of profiling cloud microphysics. Sensitivities of vapor, liquid, and ice with respect to 20.6, 31.65 and 90 GHz brightness temperatures are studied. For the model studies, the atmosphere is characterized by vapor density and temperature profiles and layers of liquid and ice components. A parameterized radiative transfer model is used to quantify radiation emanating from the atmosphere. It is shown that downwelling scattering of radiation by an ice layer results in enhancement at 90 GHz brightness temperature. Once absorptive components such as vapor and liquid are estimated accurately, then it is shown that the ice water path can be retrieved using ground-based three-channel radiometer observations. In this paper the authors developed two- and three-channel neural network-based inversion models. Success of a neural network-based approach is demonstrated using a simulated time series of vapor, liquid, and ice. Performance of the standard explicit inversion model is compared with an iterative inversion model. In part II of this paper, actual radiometer, and radar field measurements are utilized to show practical applicability of the inverse models.","doi":"10.1109/36.563260","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/12234/00563260.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.563260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave radiometric technique to retrieve vapor, liquid and ice.

Real-time monitoring of continuous heart sound in patients detected by precordial Doppler ultrasound is, thus, vital for early detection of venous air embolism (VAE) during surgery. In this study, the multiscale feature of wavelet transforms (WT's) is exploited to examine the embolic Doppler heart sound (DHS) during intravenous air injections in dogs. As both humans and dogs share similar physiological conditions, the authors' methods and results for dogs are expected to be applicable to humans. The WT of DHS at scale 2/sup j/(j=1,2) selectively magnified the power of embolic, but not the normal, heart sound. Statistically, the enhanced embolic power was found to be sensitive (P<0.01 at 0.01 ml of injected air) and correlated significantly (P<0.0005, /spl tau/=0.83) with the volume of injected air from 0.01 to 0.10 ml. A fast detection algorithm of O(N) complexity with unit complexity constant for VAE was developed (processing speed=8 ms per heartbeat), which confirmed the feasibility of real-time processing for both humans and dogs.","doi":"10.1109/10.563293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/12235/00563293.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.563293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12235","startPage":"237","endPage":"246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast detection of venous air embolism in Doppler heart sound using the wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast detection of venous air embolism in Doppler heart sound using the wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563293/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5542544","pubMedId":"9125806","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast detection of venous air embolism in Doppler heart sound using the wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00563293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05817S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"34","articleId":"563293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":563315,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm, in which an initial estimate is sequentially projected onto the individual sets according to a periodic schedule, has been the most prevalent tool to solve such problems. Nonetheless, POCS has several shortcomings: it converges slowly, it is ill suited for implementation on parallel processors, and it requires the computation of exact projections at each iteration. We propose a general parallel projection method (EMOPSP) that overcomes these shortcomings. At each iteration of EMOPSP, a convex combination of subgradient projections onto some of the sets is formed and the update is obtained via relaxation. The relaxation parameter may vary over an iteration-dependent, extrapolated range that extends beyond the interval [0,2] used in conventional projection methods. EMOPSP not only generalizes existing projection-based schemes, but it also converges very efficiently thanks to its extrapolated relaxations. Theoretical convergence results are presented as well as numerical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/12240/00563316.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.563316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.563316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convex set theoretic image recovery by extrapolated iterations of parallel subgradient projections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hilbert space","Concurrent computing","Image converters","Fourier transforms","Wavelet transforms","Estimation theory","Constraint theory","Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","convergence of numerical methods","extrapolation","set theory","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex set theoretic image recovery","extrapolated iterations","parallel subgradient projections","convex sets","closed sets","Hilbert space","projection onto convex sets algorithm","periodic schedule","general parallel projection method","EMOPSP","subgradient projections","relaxation parameter","iteration-dependent extrapolated range","extrapolated relaxations","convergence results","numerical simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","displayDocTitle":"Convex set theoretic image recovery by extrapolated iterations of parallel subgradient projections","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5544113","pubMedId":"18282944","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex set theoretic image recovery by extrapolated iterations of parallel subgradient projections","sourcePdf":"00563316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028306S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"129","articleId":"563316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":563318,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

This paper presents two techniques for reconstruction of lost subband coefficients, one for low-frequency coefficients and one for high-frequency coefficients. The low-frequency reconstruction algorithm is based on inherent properties of the hierarchical subband decomposition. To maintain smoothness and exploit the high intraband correlation, a cubic interpolative surface is fit to known coefficients to interpolate lost coefficients. Accurate edge placement, crucial for visual quality, is achieved by adapting the interpolation grid in both the horizontal and vertical directions as determined by the edges present. An edge model is used to characterize the adaptation, and a quantitative analysis of this model demonstrates that edges can be identified by simply examining the high-frequency bands, without requiring any additional processing of the low-frequency band. High-frequency reconstruction is performed using linear interpolation, which provides good visual performance as well as maintains properties required for edge placement in the low-frequency reconstruction algorithm. The complete algorithm performs well on loss of single coefficients, vectors, and small blocks, and is therefore applicable to a variety of source coding techniques.","doi":"10.1109/83.563318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"523","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.563318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12240","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/12240/00563318.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Propagation losses","Filter bank","Forward error correction","Automatic repeat request","Decoding","Interpolation","Videoconference","Workstations","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image reconstruction","correlation methods","interpolation","decoding","edge detection","source coding","packet switching","telecommunication networks","two-dimensional digital filters","quadrature mirror filters","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband coded image reconstruction","lossy packet networks","digital subband coded image transmission","decoder","subband coefficients","low-frequency coefficients","high-frequency coefficients","low-frequency reconstruction algorithm","hierarchical subband decomposition","high intraband correlation","cubic interpolative surface","lost coefficients interpolation","edge placement","visual quality","edge model","high-frequency bands","linear interpolation","visual performance","source coding","2D filter","filter bank","quadrature mirror filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Subband-coded image reconstruction for lossy packet networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563318/","volume":"6","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5544115","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18282946","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband-coded image reconstruction for lossy packet networks","sourcePdf":"00563318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037438S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"49","articleId":"563318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":563319,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The smoothness measure and the constraints are combined in a Bayesian probabilistic formulation, and are implemented as a Markov random field (MRF) image model.

The model is based on the description of injection-locking by Lang (1982) which is shown to hold even under the condition of strong injection and large detuning of the input signals. The following results are obtained: the configuration allows all-optical wavelength conversion in the multigigabit range, and both logically noninverting and inverting conversion is possible. In both operation modes, the conversion mechanism is mainly attributed to dispersive switching which is shown to be very fast above threshold due to injection-locking. Operation up to data rates of 20 Gb/s is possible with reasonable output extinction ratio. The bandwidth is determined by the relaxation oscillation frequency of the laser. It will be extended by decreasing the resonator length, increasing the injected current, and increasing the injected optical power. The output signal is nearly chirp-free. The model is able to explain the main results of previously published experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/12238/00563389.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.563389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.563389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-signal analysis of all-optical wavelength conversion using two-mode injection-locking in semiconductor lasers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical wavelength conversion","Optical resonators","Signal analysis","Fabry-Perot","Laser mode locking","Optical modulation","Wavelength conversion","Dispersion","Extinction ratio","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor lasers","Fabry-Perot resonators","laser cavity resonators","optical frequency conversion","optical switches","laser modes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-optical wavelength conversion","two-mode injection-locking","semiconductor lasers","large-signal analysis","DC-biased Fabry-Perot laser","optical injection","CW signal","modulated signal","injection-locking","input signals","multigigabit range","inverting conversion","noninverting conversion","operation modes","conversion mechanism","dispersive switching","threshold","data rates","output extinction ratio","bandwidth","relaxation oscillation frequency","resonator length","injected current","injected power","20 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Large-signal analysis of all-optical wavelength conversion using two-mode injection-locking in semiconductor lasers","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5548591","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-signal analysis of all-optical wavelength conversion using two-mode injection-locking in semiconductor lasers","sourcePdf":"00563389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08052S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"53","articleId":"563389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563437,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

A review of several projects of CDMA based mobile LEO satellite communication system is given to demonstrate the ideas in practice. The contrast of the differences between terrestrial and satellite mobile communications based on CDMA will be presented with special emphasis on intercell versus interspot interference in land and multiple beam interference in satellite systems, respectively. Specific synchronisation issues due to high Doppler will be also addressed. This will include frequency compensation techniques based on pilot carrier. The reliability of Doppler estimation for different elevation angles as a function of the ratio of the pilot carrier to the overall signal power will be given. A review of the existing and new code acquisition techniques for very low signal to noise ratios will be also presented. Capacity issues and possible improvements by using multi-user detectors will be discussed in a realistic environment.

The proposed system is described, along with the CDMA performance of the prototype equipment with the non-geostationary ETS-VI satellite at the S-band (2.3/2.1 GHz) with Ka-band (30/20 GHz) feeder link. The use of FEC reduces the effect of multiple access interference, and enhances the bit error performance under CDMA conditions. Both the IF loop back and satellite link test performances of the prototype equipment prove it has the potential for personal and mobile satellite applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563440","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563440.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"931 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable data rate CDMA experiment with non-geostationary ETS-VI satellite","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563440/","displayDocTitle":"Variable data rate CDMA experiment with non-geostationary ETS-VI satellite","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637499","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable data rate CDMA experiment with non-geostationary ETS-VI satellite","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036414S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"3","articleId":"563440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":563441,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

In this paper, a class of root-of-unity sequence sets with certain interesting correlation properties is identified as a very important source of PRUS. By deriving a general construction of such sequence sets, a new, even more general unified PRUS construction is obtained. In addition, a new lower bound on the total number of PRUS with given alphabet size and sequence length is derived by determining the exact number of PRUS obtainable from the construction. The bound is tight for all cases, in which the exact values are known. Furthermore, it is proved that there is no new PRUS obtainable through the application of various perfectness-invariant transformations and the direct product construction. This gives strong evidences to support the conjecture that the new unified construction in fact describes all PRUS that exist.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","startPage":"955","endPage":"959 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563445.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new unified construction of perfect root-of-unity sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"A new unified construction of perfect root-of-unity sequences","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637503","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new unified construction of perfect root-of-unity sequences","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052148S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"46","articleId":"563445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":563446,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this article, the average interference parameter of concatenated sequences (also known as Kronecker sequences) is derived as a function of the interference parameters of the inner and the outer sequences. Bounds on the average interference parameter are given. Although the peak correlation parameters of families of concatenated spreading sequences are rather poor compared to those of 'linear' families of sequences of the same length (e.g. Gold-sequences), it is shown that the interference parameters are not worse. Moreover, the structure of concatenated sequences can be used to reduce receiver complexity and to speed up code acquisition in the high SNR-region. Additionally, families of concatenated sequences can be constructed with a greater flexibility in the choice of the parameters (size of the family, length of the sequences) than 'linear' families.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563446","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563446.pdf","startPage":"960","endPage":"964 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference parameters of concatenated spreading sequences for asynchronous CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563446/","displayDocTitle":"Interference parameters of concatenated spreading sequences for asynchronous CDMA","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637504","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference parameters of concatenated spreading sequences for asynchronous CDMA","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031554S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"2","articleId":"563446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":563449,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Presently investigated multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) concepts explicitly avoid the occurrence of intersymbol interference (ISI), which facilitates the use of simple receivers. Unfortunately, the application of such MC-CDMA concepts cannot be recommended in outdoor environments. In pt. I, an MC-CDMA concept, which overcomes this disadvantage, has been introduced and described mathematically for the first time. The presented MC-CDMA concept explicitly allows ISI. In order to mitigate the effects of multiple access interference (MAI) and ISI, the deployment of joint detection (JD) techniques is proposed. Four JD techniques which are suitable for the application in the presented MC-CDMA concept are introduced. Finally, the performance, which can be achieved by applying the proposed JD techniques in the presented MC-CDMA concept, is analyzed in the case of the uplink.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563454","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563454.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"1000 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint detection for multicarrier CDMA mobile radio systems.

But in a mobile system, it is unreasonable to assume perfect knowledge of the propagation delays for each mobile user at all times since these delays change when mobile units move. Therefore a method for tracking propagation delays in a practical asynchronous CDMA system is needed. In this paper, we introduce a multiuser detector which is able to track time-varying delays directly, and converges in a stationary environment to the decorrelating detector. It has the advantage of being a blind algorithm, in the sense that it does not require the use of training sequences, and therefore represents a more practical approach than other adaptive multiuser detectors based on linear filtering.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1005 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563455.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive delay tracking in asynchronous multiuser CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive delay tracking in asynchronous multiuser CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637512","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive delay tracking in asynchronous multiuser CDMA systems","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033841S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","articleId":"563455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":563460,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

This technique is shown to be highly resistant to near-far effects. A comparative performance analysis of conventional, optimum multiuser and NMF single user receivers is carried out via Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that the proposed single user NMF detectors have comparative, and even better, performance than the optimum multi-user receiver in severe near-far cases. This exalted performance is due to the implicit cancellation of cross-correlation between different users' codes. The suggested technique is also not sensitive to the code selection and does not necessitates the use of sophisticated optimized code families.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network matched filter receivers for CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563460","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563460.pdf","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1028 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Neural network matched filter receivers for CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637516","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network matched filter receivers for CDMA systems","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0444S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"3","articleId":"563460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":563462,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Conventional DS-CDMA mobile communication systems employ long codes in order to \"whiten\" the interference signals from other cells. The conventional long code randomizes not only the undesired signals but also the different delay components of the desired signal which, therefore, become noise and are not combined in the RAKE processing. This phenomena impairs the RAKE performance. A method is proposed in order to reduce this impairment by introducing a new long code with higher correlation between chip intervals. An analysis shows the relationship between the auto-correlation and de-spread signals, and its influence on the BER performance.

In a DS-CDMA system intracell co-channel interference has to be taken into account in addition to intercell interference. The available system capacity, which is one of the main important parameters for the system selection from the network operators point of view, is determined by the carrier/interference-ratio and the co-channel interference resistance of an air interface. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of multipath propagation on the downlink capacity based on the transmitter and receiver signal processing. The wideband radio channel is characterized by a time-variant tapped delay line including adjacent cell interference. For well defined conditions the downlink system capacity is evaluated with respect to a quality of service criterion. With increasing number of significant multipath components and decreasing mobile speed the capacity is decreasing considerably.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563468.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1067 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink performance of IS-95 DS-CDMA under multipath propagation conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Personal communication networks","Interchannel interference","Time division multiple access","GSM","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Signal processing","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","standardisation","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","multipath channels","radio links","land mobile radio","radiowave propagation","radiofrequency interference","signal processing","time-varying channels","delay lines","adjacent channel interference","channel capacity","cochannel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IS-95 DS-CDMA","multipath propagation conditions","downlink performance","PCS applications","USA","direct sequence code division multiple access","time division multiple access","PCS 1900","GSM","D-AMPS","intracell cochannel interference","intercell interference","system capacity","network operators","carrier/interference ratio","cochannel interference resistance","air interface","downlink capacity","receiver signal processing","transmitter signal processing","wideband radio channel","time-variant tapped delay line","adjacent cell interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Downlink performance of IS-95 DS-CDMA under multipath propagation conditions","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637524","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink performance of IS-95 DS-CDMA under multipath propagation conditions","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563468.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036392S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"1","articleId":"563468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563469,"authors":[{"name":"X.H.

The scheme can be applied in Doppler compensation of the received signals, to aid in the code acquisition under the severe Doppler conditions offered by the satellite channel.

The results show that Doppler estimation and compensation is possible with very high reliability, giving a probability of correct estimate >0.9995 down to 25/spl deg/ elevation with /spl plusmn/250 Hz accuracy. However, in the urban shadowed channel state the performance is poor and reliable Doppler estimation is not possible. The estimator is also able to track the variation of Doppler with time even under the worst-case Doppler rate conditions. The estimator structure is simple, requiring only an FFT with averaging as post processing. By assuming that the proposed Doppler compensation was achieved to /spl plusmn/250 Hz accuracy, code acquisition was demonstrated to be feasible with acceptable acquisition time by a 1-dimensional serial search instead of the considerably longer 2-dimensional search that would be required in the uncompensated case.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563487","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563487.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1161 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of pilot carrier based Doppler compensation for CDMA land mobile satellite links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of pilot carrier based Doppler compensation for CDMA land mobile satellite links","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563487/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5644003","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of pilot carrier based Doppler compensation for CDMA land mobile satellite links","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037635S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"1","articleId":"563487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":563488,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This suggested technique is motivated by the inherent interference rejection capability of such spread-spectrum type system, specially in circumstances where immunity against Doppler shift and fading due to multipath propagation are important. The used chirp signals are selected such that they all have the same power as well as the same bandwidth. Closed form expressions, as well as approximate analytical expressions, for the cross-coherence functions between the different forms of considered chirp signals are derived. The performance of a suggested coherent receiver structure is investigated and the corresponding error rates are presented. The results show that the proposed multiuser chirp signaling technique is efficient and promising as a multiple-access technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563498/","accessionNumber":"5644013","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient multiple-access communications using multi-user chirp modulation signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient multiple-access communications using multi-user chirp modulation signals","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038468S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"29","articleId":"563498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":563500,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For satellite diversity, the correlation of two independent channels is determined.

By simulating the intercell interference with directional subscriber antennas and the bit error rate performance in a slowly fading Rician channel, the capacity of both forward and reverse link are calculated.

MLDDs allow the reduction of memory occupation with respect to traditional ROBDDs by decomposing logic functions recursively into simpler-and more sharable-blocks. The representation is less sensitive to variable ordering, and because of this property, analysis of the MLDD graphs allows at times the identification of better variable orderings. The identification of more terminal cases by Boolean algebra techniques makes it possible to compensate the additional-small-CPU time required to identify the disjoint-support decomposition. We expect the properties of MLDDs to be useful in several contexts, most notably logic synthesis, technology mapping, and sequential hardware verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct 1996","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5437638","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Boolean function representation based on disjoint-support decompositions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boolean function representation based on disjoint-support decompositions","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00563527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046003S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4128","citationCount":"7","articleId":"563527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":563529,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The efficiency of a new low-cost vector-less test solution, known as oscillation-test, is investigated. During the test mode, the op-amps are converted to a circuit that oscillates. The oscillation frequency is evaluated to monitor faults. The tolerance band of the oscillation frequency is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis taking into account the nominal tolerance of all important technology and design parameters. Faults in the op-amps under test which cause the oscillation frequency to exit the tolerance band can therefore be detected. Some design for testability (DFT) rules to rearrange op-amps to form oscillators are presented and the related practical problems and limitations are discussed. The oscillation frequency can be easily and precisely evaluated using pure digital circuitry. The simulation and practical implementation results confirm that the presented method assures a high fault coverage with a low area overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1996.563529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1996.563529","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

In this scheme, communication between every pair of modules is done through an asynchronous FIFO channel; communication between a module and the FIFO is done using a request/acknowledge handshaking. Synchronization of handshaking signals to the local module clock is done in an unconventional way-the local clock built out of a ring oscillator is paused or stretched, if necessary, to ensure that the handshaking signal satisfies setup and hold time constraints with respect to the local clock. We constructed a test bed consisting of two synchronous modules with pausible clocking control and an asynchronous FIFO on a MOSIS 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS chip. The resulting system functions reliably up to the local clock frequency of 220 MHz (according to SPICE simulation)-the maximum clock rate is limited by the ring oscillator not the pausible clocking control. Preliminary test results indicate that the fabricated chips operate correctly as simulated.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4128/12215/00563543.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

This internal congestion control includes selective cell discard, priority service scheduling, and fuzzy controlled buffer management.

The SMXQ scheme assumes a queue length threshold is chosen for the logical queue pertaining to each output port, and if the queue length exceeds the threshold the arriving cells are discarded. Selective cell discard is performed per port basis when the shared buffer is full or the queue length of a particular output port exceeds its threshold. For each output port, {CLP=1} cells will be discarded before any {CLP=0} cell is discarded. The set of chosen queue length thresholds are computed directly by an on-chip fuzzy congestion controller (FCC) in sub microsecond intervals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CAM-based VLSI architecture for shared buffer ATM switch with fuzzy controlled buffer management","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

Since the computing resources needed for simulation depend on the size of the trace, it is not always practical to use the complete trace of an application for simulation. This paper proposes a new technique, profile-driven sampling, for obtaining a reduced trace that is representative of the complete trace. Inaccuracy in the prediction of performance using such a reduced trace, is generally less than that from reduced traces using published techniques. For example, the prediction inaccuracy due to profile-driven sampling is 50 percent less than that using periodic time-based sampling. Profile-driven sampling also eliminates sensitivity to sampling parameters, such as sample size and inter-sample interval of periodic window based trace sampling, resulting, in a simple and robust trace generation process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5437672","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Profile-driven generation of trace samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Profile-driven generation of trace samples","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00563560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033188S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4128","citationCount":"7","articleId":"563560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":563575,"authors":[{"name":"Gin Yee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Gin Yee","id":"37357650000"},{"name":"C.

The new algorithm presented here has the following features unlike other square root algorithms. First, the focus of the \"non-restoring\" is on the \"partial remainder\", not on \"each bit of the square root\", with each iteration. Second, it only requires one traditional adder/subtracter in each iteration, i.e., it does not require other hardware components, such as seed generators, multipliers, or even multiplexors. Third, it generates the correct resulting value even in the last bit position. Next, based on the resulting value of the last bit, a precise remainder can be obtained immediately without any correction or addition operation. And finally, it can be implemented at very fast clock rate because of the very simple operations at each iteration. We illustrate two VLSI implementations of the new algorithm. One is a fully pipelined high-performance implementation that can accept a new square-root instruction each clock cycle with each pipeline stage requiring a minimum number of gate counts. The other is a low-cost implementation that uses only a single adder/subtractor for iterative operation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1996.563604","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

Pan and C.L. Liu (1996). The time complexity of their algorithm, however, is O(K/sup 3/n/sup 4/ log(Kn/sup 2/) log n) for sequential circuits with n gates, which is too high for medium and large size designs in practice. In this paper, we present three strategies to improve the performance of that approach:(1) efficient label update with single K-cut computation based on the monotone property of labels that we showed for sequential circuits, (2) a novel approach for the K-cut computation in partial flow networks, which are much smaller in practice, (3) SCC (strongly connected component) partition to further speedup the algorithm. In practice, our algorithm works in O(Kn/sup 3/logn) time and O(Kn) space according to our experimental results. It is 2/spl times/10/sup 4/ times faster than SeqMapII-opt for computing optimal solutions and 2 times faster than SeqMapII-heu which uses very small expanded circuits as a heuristic.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1996.563608","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

A major problem in multi-carrier systems is the inter-modulation distortion due to the non-linearity of the power amplifier stage. Since the multi-carrier signal has a large amplitude variation it is subject to AM/AM and AM/PM distortion due to power amplifiers. This distortion adds to the co-channel interference and causes a significant degradation to the system performance. This paper studies the performance of the multi-carrier CDMA system in an AWGN channel without fading but with amplifier non-linearity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of cellular portable unit amplifier non-linearity on the performance of the multi-carrier CDMA system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563614","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12243/00563614.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1355 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"The effect of cellular portable unit amplifier non-linearity on the performance of the multi-carrier CDMA system","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637551","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of cellular portable unit amplifier non-linearity on the performance of the multi-carrier CDMA system","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053433S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"4","articleId":"563614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":563617,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Since the architecture computes weighted sums of this neighborhood, by using a \"B-template,\" it is limited to threshold logic, i.e., a logical operation to be computed by a single transient must be in the class of linearly separable Boolean functions. It was shown previously how a general logic function can be implemented on the CNNUM by cascading component functions from this class-namely by the direct implementation of the minterm or maxterm formulation of the desired function. However, for functions of a 3/spl times/3 input neighborhood this method may require up to 256 stages. We propose a more efficient method for implementing general logic functions on the CNNUM and other hardwares capable of performing a threshold logic function of an input neighborhood. The class of considered component functions is a superset of the minterms and maxterms but, for purposes of searchability, ease of implementation, and robustness, a subset of the general linearly separable Boolean functions. We have formulated an algorithm that will find a sequence of weight-restricted threshold logic functions (B-templates with weights from {-1, 0, +1} and a bias) that, when cascaded together using two-input logical operations, will result in the desired Boolean function. Two examples are given to exhibit the algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/12246/00563626.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.563626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.563626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient implementation of neighborhood logic for cellular automata via the Cellular Neural Network Universal Machine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Logic functions","Boolean functions","Automata","Turing machines","Computer architecture","Hardware","Robustness","Image processing","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","cellular neural nets","threshold logic","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neighborhood logic","cellular automata","cellular neural network universal machine","arbitrary logic functions","weighted sums","B-template","threshold logic","linearly separable Boolean functions","component function cascading","minterms maxterms superset","searchability","weight-restricted threshold logic functions","two-input logical operations","algorithm","ballterm class"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Efficient implementation of neighborhood logic for cellular automata via the Cellular Neural Network Universal Machine","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5556752","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient implementation of neighborhood logic for cellular automata via the Cellular Neural Network Universal Machine","sourcePdf":"00563626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039108S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"25","articleId":"563626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563627,"authors":[{"name":"P.

GASP (general automatic sensor planning) uses a feature inspection representation (the FIR), which contains the explicit solution for the simplest sensor positioning problem. The FIR is generated off-line, and is exploited by GASP to compute on-line plans for more complex tasks, called inspection scripts. Viewpoint optimality is defined as a function of feature visibility and measurement reliability. Visibility is computed using an approximate model. Reliability of inspection depends on both the physical sensors acquiring the images and on the processing software; therefore we include both these components in a generalized sensor model. These predictions are based on experimental, quantitative assessment. We show how these are computed for a real generalized sensor, which includes a 3-D range imaging system, and software performing robust outlier removal, surface segmentation, object location and surface fitting. Finally, we demonstrate a complete inspection session involving 3-D object positioning, planning optimal position inspection, and feature measurement from the optimal viewpoint.","doi":"10.1109/70.563641","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/12248/00563641.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.563641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based planning of optimal sensor placements for inspection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Model-based planning of optimal sensor placements for inspection","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5550124","publicationDate":"April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based planning of optimal sensor placements for inspection","sourcePdf":"00563641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074221S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"69","articleId":"563641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":563642,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

As polarization sensing not only measures intensity but also additional physical parameters of light, it can therefore provide a richer set of descriptive physical constraints for the understanding of images. Previously it has been shown that polarization cues can be used to perform dielectric/metal material identification, specular and diffuse reflection component analysis, as well as complex image segmentations that would be significantly more complicated or even infeasible using intensity and color alone. Such analysis has so far been done with a linear polarizer mechanically rotated in front of a CCD camera. The full automation of resolving polarization components using liquid crystals not only affords an elegant application, but significantly speeds up the sensing of polarization components and reduces the amount of optical distortion present in the wobbling of a mechanically rotating polarizer. In our system two twisted nematic liquid crystals are placed in front of a fixed linear polarizer placed in front of a CCD camera. The application of a series of electrical pulses to the liquid crystals in synchronization with the CCD camera video frame rate produces a controlled sequence of polarization component images that are stored and processed on Datacube boards. We present a scheme for mapping a partial linear polarization state measured at a pixel into hue, saturation and intensity producing a representation for a partial linear polarization image. Our polarization camera currently senses partial linear polarization and outputs such a color representation image at 5 Hz. The unique vision understanding capabilities of our polarization camera system are demonstrated with experimental results showing polarization-based dielectric/metal material classification, specular reflection and occluding contour segmentations in a fairly complex scene, and surface orientation constraints.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/12248/00563642.pdf","doi":"10.1109/70.563642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.563642","startPage":"195","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Liquid crystal polarization camera","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563642/","displayDocTitle":"Liquid crystal polarization camera","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5550125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Liquid crystal polarization camera","sourcePdf":"00563642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082134S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"56","articleId":"563642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563644,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The authors implemented two approaches that utilize MR data for PET reconstruction. The anatomical MR information is modeled as a priori distribution of the PET image and combined with the distribution of the measured PET data to generate the a posteriori function from which the expectation maximization (EM)-type algorithm with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is derived. One algorithm (Markov-GEM) uses a Gibbs function to model interactions between neighboring pixels within the anatomical regions. The other (Gauss-EM) applies a Gauss function with the same mean for all pixels in a given anatomical region. A basic assumption of these methods is that the radioactivity is homogeneously distributed inside anatomical regions. Simulated and phantom data are investigated under the following aspects: count density, object size, missing anatomical information, and misregistration of the anatomical information. Compared with the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) algorithm the results of both algorithms show a large reduction of noise with a better delineation of borders. Of the two algorithms tested, the Gauss-EM method is superior in noise reduction (up to 50%). Regarding incorrect a priori information the Gauss-EM algorithm is very sensitive, whereas the Markov-GEM algorithm proved to be stable with a small change of recovery coefficients between 0.5 and 3%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563658/","volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5547309","pubMedId":"9101322","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","displayDocTitle":"Expectation maximization reconstruction of positron emission tomography images using anatomical magnetic resonance information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expectation maximization reconstruction of positron emission tomography images using anatomical magnetic resonance information","sourcePdf":"00563658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052086S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"98","articleId":"563658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":563660,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A rebinning algorithm is one that first sorts the 3-D data into an ordinary two-dimensional (2-D) data set containing one sinogram for each transaxial slice to be reconstructed; the 3-D image is then recovered by applying to each slice a 2-D reconstruction method such as filtered-backprojection. This approach allows a significant speedup of 3-D reconstruction, which is particularly useful for applications involving dynamic acquisitions or whole-body imaging. The first new algorithm is obtained by discretizing an exact analytical inversion formula. The second algorithm, called the Fourier rebinning algorithm (FORE), is approximate but allows an efficient implementation based on taking 2-D Fourier transforms of the data. This second algorithm was implemented and applied to data acquired with the new generation of PET systems and also to simulated data for a scanner with an 18/spl deg/ axial aperture. The reconstructed images were compared to those obtained with the 3-D reprojection algorithm (3DRP) which is the standard \"exact\" 3-D filtered-backprojection method.

(2) The algorithms intrinsically accommodate nonnegativity constraints, unlike many gradient-based methods. (3) The algorithms are easily parallelizable, unlike the SCA algorithm and perhaps line-search algorithms. We show that the GCA algorithms converge faster than the SCA algorithm, even on conventional workstations. An example from a low-count positron emission tomography (PET) transmission scan illustrates the method.","doi":"10.1109/42.563662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/12249/00563662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.563662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12249","startPage":"166","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grouped-coordinate ascent algorithms for penalized-likelihood transmission image reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Grouped-coordinate ascent algorithms for penalized-likelihood transmission image reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5554194","pubMedId":"9101326","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grouped-coordinate ascent algorithms for penalized-likelihood transmission image reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00563662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048441S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"171","articleId":"563662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563663,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Using the model, cerebral images are segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The model accounts for random noise, magnetic field inhomogeneities, and biological variations of the tissues. Intensity measurements are modeled by a finite Gaussian mixture. Smoothness and piecewise contiguous nature of the tissue regions are modeled by a three-dimensional (3-D) Markov random field (MRF). A segmentation algorithm, based on the statistical model, approximately finds the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the segmentation and estimates the model parameters from the image data. The proposed scheme for segmentation is based on the iterative conditional modes (ICM) algorithm in which measurement model parameters are estimated using local information at each site, and the prior model parameters are estimated using the segmentation after each cycle of iterations. Application of the algorithm to a sample of clinical MR brain scans, comparisons of the algorithm with other statistical methods, and a validation study with a phantom are presented. The algorithm constitutes a significant step toward a complete data driven unsupervised approach to segmentation of MR images in the presence of the random noise and intensity inhomogeneities.","doi":"10.1109/42.563663","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/12249/00563663.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.563663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical approach to segmentation of single-channel cerebral MR images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","displayDocTitle":"Statistical approach to segmentation of single-channel cerebral MR images","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5554195","pubMedId":"9101327","publicationDate":"April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical approach to segmentation of single-channel cerebral MR images","sourcePdf":"00563663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082393S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"431","articleId":"563663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":563664,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.","doi":"10.1109/42.563664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/12249/00563664.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.563664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodality image registration by maximization of mutual information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563664/","displayDocTitle":"Multimodality image registration by maximization of mutual information","volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5554196","pubMedId":"9101328","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodality image registration by maximization of mutual information","sourcePdf":"00563664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046363S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"3020","articleId":"563664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":563665,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The circuit technique is designed using a pass-gate logic tree in DCVSPG instead of the nMOS logic tree in the conventional DCVS circuit, which eliminates the floating node problem. By eliminating the floating node problem, the DCVSPG becomes a new type of ratioless circuit, and it also provides superior performance with less power dissipation and better silicon area tradeoff. The basic DCVSPG design technique, the methodology for optimization, and synthesis of the pass-gate logic tree are described. The standard cell library development taking advantage of the dual-rail outputs of DCVSPG gates is also discussed. The performance comparisons with other existing pass-gate circuit techniques [complimentary pass-transistor logic (CPL), double pass-transistor logic (DPL), and swing restored pass-transistor logic (SRPL)] are presented. For more robust design, the DCVSPG with inverter buffers is also the best choice. A Viterbi macro design using the DCVSPG circuit technique is demonstrated. The process that the design is based upon is a 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS technology with 0.25-/spl mu/m effective channel length and five layers of metal. This macro can run up to 500 MHz at the nominal process condition. In comparison with other existing dynamic circuit techniques, the results also clearly show that the dynamic DCVSPG has the superior power-delay performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.563678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/12250/00563678.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"573","doi":"10.1109/4.563678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of differential cascode voltage switch with pass-gate (DCVSPG) logic for high-performance digital systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of differential cascode voltage switch with pass-gate (DCVSPG) logic for high-performance digital systems","volume":"32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5548353","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563678/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of differential cascode voltage switch with pass-gate (DCVSPG) logic for high-performance digital systems","sourcePdf":"00563678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028352S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"61","articleId":"563678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":563679,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Noise dependence on collector resistance and buried layer doping of the noisy bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is obtained by means of simulation. It is observed that trends are different depending on bipolar transistor biasing: in common-collector, a low collector resistance is desired, while in common-emitter biasing, large values of Rc make the transistor less noisy. A test chip is fabricated in 3-/spl mu/m BiCMOS technology to measure the substrate coupling produced by different BICMOS inverter gates.

Computational tasks that realize the control algorithms are usually scheduled by treating their execution times and periods as unchangeable parameters. Task scheduling therefore depends only on the limited computing resources available. On the other hand, controller design is primarily based on the continuous-time dynamics of the physical system being controlled. The set of tasks resulting from this controller design may not be schedulable with the limited computing resources available. Even if the given set of tasks is schedulable, the overall control performance may not be optimal in the sense that they do not make a full use of the computing resource. We propose an integrated approach to controller design and task scheduling. Specifically, task frequencies (or periods) are allowed to vary within a certain range as long as such a change does not affect critical control functions such as maintenance of system stability. We present an algorithm that optimizes task frequencies and then schedules the resulting tasks with the limited computing resources available. The proposed approach is also applicable to failure recovery and reconfiguration in real-time control systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4270/12245/00563693.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"21","publicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1996.563693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1996.563693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On task schedulability in real-time control systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Control systems","Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Digital control","Dynamic scheduling","System performance","Application software","Software engineering","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","real-time systems","computerised control","resource allocation","system recovery","software fault tolerance","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task schedulability","real-time control systems","controller design","digital implementation","computational tasks","execution times","computing resources","continuous-time dynamics","control performance","task scheduling","task frequencies","system stability","failure recovery","reconfiguration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","displayDocTitle":"On task schedulability in real-time control systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5485396","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On task schedulability in real-time control systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00563693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033035S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270","citationCount":"256","articleId":"563693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563710,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Mehra","affiliation":["Real-Time Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Ashish Mehra","id":"37087455911"},{"name":"A.

The design of the architecture is based on three key goals: maintenance of QoS guarantees on a per connection basis, overload protection between established connections, and fairness in delivered performance to best effort traffic. Using this architecture we implement real time channels, a paradigm for real time communication services in packet switched networks.

Among the protocols evaluated, the new optimistic commit protocol provides the best performance for a variety of workloads and system configurations.","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1996.563719","publicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4270/12245/00563719.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1996.563719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12245","startPage":"220","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Commit processing in distributed real-time database systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Commit processing in distributed real-time database systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563719/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5485417","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Commit processing in distributed real-time database systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00563719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051157S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270","citationCount":"32","articleId":"563719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":563725,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Processes are assigned a weight which determines a share (percentage) of the resource they are to receive. The resource is then allocated in discrete-sized time quanta in such a manner that each process makes progress at a precise, uniform rate. Proportional share allocation algorithms are of interest because: they provide a natural means of seamlessly integrating real and non-real-time processing; they are easy to implement; they provide a simple and effective means of precisely controlling the real-time performance of a process; and they provide a natural means of policing so that processes that use more of a resource than they request have no ill-effect on well-behaved processes. We analyze our algorithm in the context of an idealized system in which a resource is assumed to be granted in arbitrarily small intervals of time and show that our algorithm guarantees that the difference between the service time that a process should receive and the service time it actually receives is optimally bounded by the size of a time quantum. In addition, the algorithm provides support for dynamic operations, such as processes joining or leaving the competition, and for both fractional and non-uniform time quanta. As a proof of concept we have implemented a prototype of a CPU scheduler under FreeBSD. The experimental results shows that our implementation performs within the theoretical bounds and hence supports real-time execution in a general purpose operating system.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563725.png","displayPublicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4270/12245/00563725.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1996.563725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1996.563725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proportional share resource allocation algorithm for real-time, time-shared systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Real time systems","Operating systems","Processor scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis","Teleconferencing","Proportional control","Context-aware services","Prototypes","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","real-time systems","time-sharing programs","operating systems (computers)","software performance evaluation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proportional share resource allocation algorithm","real-time system","idealized system","real-time performance","time-shared operating systems","service time","optimally bounded","dynamic operations","CPU scheduler","FreeBSD","general purpose operating system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","displayDocTitle":"A proportional share resource allocation algorithm for real-time, time-shared systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5485423","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proportional share resource allocation algorithm for real-time, time-shared systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00563725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074222S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270","citationCount":"171","articleId":"563725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":563726,"authors":[{"name":"Namyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Namyun Kim","id":"37350195400"},{"name":"Minsoo Ryu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and ERC-ACI, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Minsoo Ryu","id":"37344735000"},{"name":"Seongsoo Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and ERC-ACI, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seongsoo Hong","id":"37291724800"},{"name":"M.

The prime objective of these experiments was to evaluate a real-time design produced using the period calibration method (Gerber et al., 1995) and thus identify the limitations of the method. We chose a computerized numerical control (CNC) machine as our target real-time system and built a realistic controller and a plant simulator. Our results were extracted from a controlled series of more than a hundred test controllers obtained by varying four test variables. This study unveils many interesting facts: average sensor-to-output latency is one of the most dominating factors in determining control quality; the effect of scheduling jitter appears only when the average sensor-to-output latency is sufficiently small; and loop processing periods are another dominating factor of performance. Based on these results, we propose a new communication scheme and a new objective function for the period calibration method.","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1996.563726","publicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"17th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4270/12245/00563726.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"310","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563726.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1996.563726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual assessment of a real-time system design: a case study on a CNC controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563726/","displayDocTitle":"Visual assessment of a real-time system design: a case study on a CNC controller","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5485424","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual assessment of a real-time system design: a case study on a CNC controller","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00563726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035612S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270","citationCount":"39","articleId":"563726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":563736,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

A new method for the high resolution of the electromagnetic field with respect to both the incidence direction and delay is presented. The underlying discrete propagation model relies on the assumption that a finite known number of transverse electromagnetic plane waves characterized by their complex amplitude, propagation delay, and azimuthal incidence direction are impinging in a neighborhood of the receiver position. A space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is proposed to replace the high-dimensional optimization procedure necessary to compute the joint maximum-likelihood estimate of the waves parameters by several separate maximization processes which can be performed sequentially. The resolution and the mean convergence rate of the scheme are evaluated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations considering discrete synthetic propagation environments. Finally, the applicability of the SAGE algorithm to real propagation environments is demonstrated.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563747.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563747.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"85 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband angle of arrival estimation using the SAGE algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Spatial resolution","Electromagnetic fields","Mobile communication","Electromagnetic propagation","Electromagnetic modeling","Electromagnetic scattering","Propagation delay","High performance computing","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","land mobile radio","delays","optimisation","convergence of numerical methods","maximum likelihood estimation","radiowave propagation","linear antenna arrays","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband angle of arrival estimation","SAGE algorithm","high resolution","electromagnetic field","incidence direction","linear array","discrete propagation model","transverse electromagnetic plane waves","complex amplitude","propagation delay","azimuthal incidence direction","receiver position","space alternating generalized expectation maximization","joint maximum-likelihood estimate","mean convergence rate","Monte-Carlo simulations","discrete synthetic propagation environments","real propagation environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Wideband angle of arrival estimation using the SAGE algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629347","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband angle of arrival estimation using the SAGE algorithm","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046214S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"49","articleId":"563747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563748,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Unfortunately, the Gaussian (wide sense) stationary uncorrelated scattering (GWSSUS) simulation concept which is most wide-spread adopted in fading simulators neglects any directional anisotropy of the propagation mechanism. In this paper a directional channel simulation model is introduced which is an extension to GWSSUS. Due to its relatively low structural complexity, this directional Gaussian scattering (DGS) concept is applicable not only to soft- but also to hardware fading simulators. The most important advantage of the DGS simulator is that it can easily be configured to match the properties of real-world propagation scenarios. This is achieved based on the information available from echo estimation, a method which recently was introduced for configuring statistical GWSSUS channel models directly from the results of wide-band channel sounding.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563748","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","startPage":"86","endPage":"90 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563748.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A statistical simulation model for the directional mobile radio channel and its configuration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A statistical simulation model for the directional mobile radio channel and its configuration","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563748/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629348","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical simulation model for the directional mobile radio channel and its configuration","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062382S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"18","articleId":"563748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":563752,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This model can be used to compare various existing transmission systems and those proposed for future mobile radio communications in a basic way. It allows conclusions with respect to the complexity of the algorithms at the receiving side and the overall performance to be expected. It incorporates all known basic techniques which can be used to separate the users of a mobile communication system and to create subchannels for a \"parallel\" transmission of symbol blocks from an arbitrary user to another. The basic techniques range from FDM/FDMA to CDM/CDMA and OFDM to OCDM. The core of this model, the \"channel matrix\", is used to describe the differences and commonalities of these basic techniques. It is demonstrated that the basic effect of combinations, which allow a tradeoff between performance and complexity, becomes easy to estimate. Furthermore it is pointed out that many different techniques become equivalent, also in the case case of frequency selective radio channels, as long as multiuser receiving algorithms are assumed. As a special example of a general multiuser/multisubchannel transmission system MC-CDMA (multicarrier code division multiple access) is considered in more detail. Some conclusions concerning channel coding are also made.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563753","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563753.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"121 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563753.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MC-CDMA and its relation to general multiuser/multisubchannel transmission systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563753/","displayDocTitle":"MC-CDMA and its relation to general multiuser/multisubchannel transmission systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629353","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MC-CDMA and its relation to general multiuser/multisubchannel transmission systems","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029768S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"7","articleId":"563753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":563754,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Secondly, the effect of chip timing jitter can be mitigated by using a simple time diversity technique in combination with forward error correction coding and an ARQ scheme, as in a type-I hybrid ARQ protocol.

with matched filter correlators has been very popular in direct-sequence spread spectrum systems. Conventionally, the analysis of this acquisition method is based on the assumption that the detections between cells are independent. However, there may be strong correlations between cell detections for the case that the cell size is less than a chip duration. In this paper, the mean acquisition time performance of the acquisition method is analyzed with the cell correlations being taken into account. Numerical results show that depending on the threshold value and other system parameters the effect of cell correlations may be over 20% of the mean acquisition time for signal to noise ratios of practical interest.

For very low BER, this method requires a high computational effort. Therefore, a lot of developments in theory and application of importance sampling (IS) techniques have been done especially for AWGN channels or time-varying uniformly distributed channels. In this paper we discuss the applicability of several IS techniques for the simulation of Rayleigh fading mobile radio channels. By using the system threshold characteristic (STC) we first make an analytical statement of the IS efficiency for an AWGN and a frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channel. It is shown that due to the Rayleigh distribution the efficiency is reduced. Furthermore, the so called overbiasing effect is graphically explained and simulation results illustrate that the theoretically possible efficiencies cannot be reached in practice because of this statistic effect. Finally, the influence of time-selectivity is analysed.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563775","startPage":"224","endPage":"228 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563775.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563775.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applicability of importance sampling for Rayleigh fading mobile radio channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Applicability of importance sampling for Rayleigh fading mobile radio channels","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5629375","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563775/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applicability of importance sampling for Rayleigh fading mobile radio channels","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0411S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"2","articleId":"563775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":563779,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We introduce a wideband testbed system developed by Ericsson. The air interface concept and the proposed generic transmission scheme on the physical layer permit an easy adaptation to particular service requirements and make it easy to introduce new services to the system. The flexibility of the air interface concept is maintained by the hardware architecture of the Ericsson wideband testbed. Fixed and variable-rate speech and data services are demonstrated.

Adaptive algorithms simulated are the stochastic gradient (LMS), and recursive and block least squares. Both decision-directed and recently proposed blind algorithms, which do not require a training sequence, are compared. In addition, we present a variation on the block least squares algorithm in which the received vectors are first projected onto components of the signal space (eigenvectors) with the largest energy (eigenvalues). The purpose of the projection is to eliminate low-level background interference and noise.

By implementing antenna arrays, diversity schemes or a combination of antenna arrays and diversity techniques, the receiver can discriminate between users by their temporal signatures, spatial signatures and also make use of the statistic independence of the received signal. In this study we are interested in IWC performance and therefore the channel model is assumed to be Nakagami distributed. At the receiver an array of M antennas is used to discriminate between the users based on their spatial diversity. The fading process at each of the antenna elements are statistically dependent and further improvements can be realized by making use of the independent fading characteristics of the received signal. To make use of this statistical independent information, the performance of a P branch maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver is also considered. We further investigate the performance of a combination of P clusters of M antennas separated by the coherence bandwidth of the channel, thereby making use of both forms of spatial diversity. A comparison of the three schemes (antenna arrays, MRC diversity and a combination of antenna arrays and MRC diversity) under equal complexity conditions are made under multipath fading conditions. It is shown that the performance and capacity of a MRC diversity receiver, under the given assumptions, outperforms the other two methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563788","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","startPage":"292","endPage":"296 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563788.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS-CDMA performance with maximum ratio combining and antenna arrays in Nakagami multipath fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DS-CDMA performance with maximum ratio combining and antenna arrays in Nakagami multipath fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563788/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629388","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS-CDMA performance with maximum ratio combining and antenna arrays in Nakagami multipath fading","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028576S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"3","articleId":"563788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":563789,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

This paper intends to quantify the possible performance enhancement with respect to spectral efficiency as a performance measure for mobile radio systems. In order to obtain quantitative results, a method to determine said spectral efficiency is proposed and applied in directional inhomogeneous mobile radio scenarios.

Within ACTS the project FRAMES (Future Radio Wideband Multiple Access System) has been set up with an objective to define the UMTS radio access system. The first target of FRAMES is to investigate hybrid multiple access technologies and based on thorough evaluation of several candidate schemes select the best combination as a basis for further detailed development of the UMTS radio access system. The two hybrid multiple access evaluated schemes integrate a range of multiple access techniques that will lead to an optimised selection of the multiple access method for the UMTS. The first hybrid, slotted multiple access (SMA), has basically a TDMA platform. Furthermore, it contains a CDMA component which overcomes the near far problem of conventional CDMA. Also multicarrier techniques are included. Different bit rates can be flexibly provided by assigning different numbers of time slots, of carriers and of CDMA codes to a user. The second hybrid, code and time division multiple access (CATS) has basically a CDMA platform. It also includes an option for OFDM techniques in the downlink. Furthermore, by using multiuser detection CATS eliminates some of the typical CDMA drawbacks; thus has a very good spectral efficiency, just as its SMA counterpart.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FRAMES-hybrid multiple access technology","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563793","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563793.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"324 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563793.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"FRAMES-hybrid multiple access technology","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629393","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FRAMES-hybrid multiple access technology","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057427S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"18","articleId":"563793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":563795,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The variance of the decision parameter due to multi-user interference from adjacent carriers is derived in terms of the power spectral densities. Numerical results illustrate how the integrator in the correlation receiver suppresses interference from co-carrier and adjacent carriers. Adjacent carrier interference and system capacity increase by overlapping of carriers are also presented. In all the numerical results, various spectral shapes of the transmitted signal are investigated and compared in order to show the degree of dependency of the capacity on the shapes of the power spectral densities of the transmitted signals. It is also shown that by this scheme a capacity increase of up to 56% is easily achievable at no extra complexity.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563803.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563803.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"379 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of the overlapped carriers scheme in FD/DS-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Multipath channels","Radio frequency","Power system reliability","Filters","Transmitters","Mobile communication","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","frequency division multiple access","code division multiple access","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","cochannel interference","adjacent channel interference","channel capacity","interference suppression","spectral analysis","radio receivers","correlation methods","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FD/DS-CDMA","overlapped carriers","system performance","coherent direct-sequence CDMA","SNR","decision parameter variance","correlation receiver","multiuser interference","interference suppression","power spectral densities","cocarrier","adjacent carrier interference","system capacity","spectral shapes","transmitted signal","multipath channel","integrator","integrate-and-dump detector","third generation mobile communication system","personal communication system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of the overlapped carriers scheme in FD/DS-CDMA","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629403","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of the overlapped carriers scheme in FD/DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074258S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"5","articleId":"563803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":563804,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Seung Kwon","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Seung Kwon","id":"37335531000"},{"name":"Heon Jin Hong","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heon Jin Hong","id":"37289697200"},{"name":"Sang Gee Kang","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Gee Kang","id":"37276370800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3567-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"563804","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":50},"abstract":"This paper derives a theoretical mobile intermodulation (MIM) interference prediction model based on the TIA/EIA IS-98 specification.

This interference is due to the strong third-order intermodulation products generated by the mobile station receiver, which produce co-channel interfering signals in the server's spectrum. This paper confirms the accuracy of the theoretical prediction model with a series of measurements.

There are a number of ways of realising an all-optical CDMA system, classified as incoherent, coherent and approaches based on encoding in the frequency spectrum. This paper reviews the progress made to date in the incoherent regime, the most straightforward implementation based on the power summation of optical pulses. The review covers the basic principles of incoherent CDMA, the nature of the codes used in this approach and the resultant limitations on system performance with respect to the number of stations (code cardinality), the number of simultaneous users (correlation characteristics of the families of codes) and hardware requirements. The paper presents the latest developments with respect to the integration of conventional time spread codes, used in the realisation of these networks to date, with wavelength division concepts, commonplace in optical networking. These new families of codes exhibit an unprecedented set of characteristics when compared to existing unipolar codes in terms of their efficiency and correlation properties, allowing the goal of a large, asynchronous high speed network to become more feasible.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563813","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","startPage":"424","endPage":"430 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00563813.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incoherent optical code division multiple access systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incoherent optical code division multiple access systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563813/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629413","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incoherent optical code division multiple access systems","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064031S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"7","articleId":"563813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":563814,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The number of such WDM virtual channels may be limited by physical effects such as wavelength crosstalk, four-wave-mixing, and the combinations of filter free spectral range and bandwidth over which the associated optical amplifiers have uniform gain, as well as by the number of WDM wavelengths available. Therefore, large (i.e., >10 nodes) networks or interconnection systems which depend on WDM require wavelength re-use, multihops, and/or incorporation of other physical multi-access techniques, such as time division multiplexing (TDM). Alternatively, as we discuss, the few WDM wavelengths can be considered to be a set of \"unit vectors\", orthogonal within the WDM crosstalk, in a WDM hyperspace. This alternative approach leads to a variety of new ways to define virtual channels, based on different ways of producing coding formats from these WDM wavelengths to define addresses for the transmitters (senders) or receivers (destinations). Since the number of WDM wavelengths are finite (such as in a WDM transmitter array) and well defined, the term discrete spectral encoding, or \"DSE\", is used to describe this new kind of coding and to differentiate it from spectral slicing WDM. Depending on the manner in which the wavelengths of a WDM array are used to define the code, a WDM array of n wavelengths can generate a space with many more than n addresses. This paper describes some varieties of DSE and the characteristics of their multi-access interference.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563815.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"444 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Varieties and characteristics of discrete spectral encoding (DSE)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical transmitters","Optical filters","Time division multiplexing","Bandwidth","Stimulated emission","Optical crosstalk","Optical interconnections","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","optical crosstalk","optical transmitters","optical receivers","encoding","spectral analysis","multi-access systems","telecommunication channels","optical fibres","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete spectral encoding","DSE","wavelength division multiplexing","wavelength crosstalk","discrete wavelengths","four-wave-mixing","WDM virtual channels","filter free spectral range","bandwidth","optical amplifiers","uniform gain","WDM wavelengths","interconnection systems","wavelength reuse","multihops","unit vectors","WDM crosstalk","WDM hyperspace","coding formats","receivers","WDM transmitter array","multiaccess interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Varieties and characteristics of discrete spectral encoding (DSE)","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629415","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Varieties and characteristics of discrete spectral encoding (DSE)","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042473S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"4","articleId":"563815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":563816,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Hence, better bandwidth utilization and increased number of the users in a fiber-optics local area network can be realized at the expense of increased complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4268/12241/00563816.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"449 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISSSTA'95 International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1996.563816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=563816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical S/CDMA using OOCs designed by the extended set concept","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Optical design","Autocorrelation","Optical fiber LAN","Delay","Optical fiber networks","Decoding","Optical design techniques","Argon","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre LAN","code division multiple access","codes","optical modulation","optical signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous code division multiple access","optical S/CDMA","extended set concept","intensity modulation","direct detection","fiber-optic local area networks","codeword design","optical orthogonal codes","S/CDMA system","shifted codewords","synchronized operation","codeword length reduction","bandwidth utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/563816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Optical S/CDMA using OOCs designed by the extended set concept","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629416","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical S/CDMA using OOCs designed by the extended set concept","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"00563816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040378S","chronDate":"22-25 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268","citationCount":"1","articleId":"563816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":563819,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.O.

It was decided that a decision directed DLL (DD-DLL) was simplest to implement for the high chip-rate application, and the synchronisation of a 100 Mchips/second indoor wireless-LAN was simulated using a measured 5 GHz radio channel.

These lamps are being considered for use in a pulsed DC mode of operation in the next generation of rapid thermal processing applications. Experiments have shown that the ignition potential and prebreakdown loading effect can be predicted reasonably well so long as the water wall conductivity is maintained at a low enough value. Reignition occurs infrequently therefore efficiency requirements for the ignition source are not important. The authors propose two circuit implementations of a high voltage Cockcroft Walton rectifier which can be used to trigger breakdown in the interelectrode gap region.

Furthermore, a much simpler processing sequence is presented revealing efficiencies well above 19% on Cz-silicon and 21% on float zone-silicon.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Twenty Fifth IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference - 1996","pdfPath":"/iel3/4263/12206/00564029.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"408","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Twenty Fifth IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference - 1996","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.1996.564029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.1996.564029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12206","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solar cells with efficiencies above 21% processed from Czochralski grown silicon","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic cells","Silicon","Conductivity","Production","Charge carrier lifetime","Temperature","Boron","Solar energy","Manufacturing processes","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon","crystal growth from melt","elemental semiconductors","solar cells","semiconductor device testing","semiconductor device models","electronic engineering computing","carrier lifetime","semiconductor growth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Czochralski-grown silicon","solar cells","LBSF/PERL processing sequence","computer simulation","carrier lifetime","PV performance","material resistivity","21.7 percent","1 to 13 ohmcm","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Solar cells with efficiencies above 21% processed from Czochralski grown silicon","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5526739","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-17 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar cells with efficiencies above 21% processed from Czochralski grown silicon","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00564029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035985S","chronDate":"13-17 May 1996","isNumber":"12206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263","citationCount":"40","articleId":"564029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":564042,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Computat. Phys., vol.114, p.185-200, 1994) perfectly matched layer (PML) is developed using polarization and magnetization fields. The PML material is found to be a passive lossy electric and magnetic medium with particular conductivity and Debye dispersion characteristics. Although it is recognized that the PML medium is physically unrealizable, this polarization and magnetization field interpretation reveals the necessary characteristics of a perfect electromagnetic absorber. A Maxwellian material that has perfect absorption properties and may be physically realizable is derived with these concepts. This Maxwellian absorber is based upon a time-derivative Lorentz material (TD-LM) model for the dispersive and absorptive electric and magnetic properties of a material. This TD-LM model represents a straightforward generalization of the standard Lorentz material model to include the time derivatives of the fields as driving mechanisms for the polarization and magnetization fields. The numerical implementation of the perfect absorber is given and the resulting reflection coefficients from a perfect electric conductor-backed slab of this material are characterized. It is shown for broad bandwidth pulsed fields that this Maxwellian TD-LM slab, like the non-Maxwellian PML, has absorption characteristics in the 70-110-dB range for large angles of incidence. Strategies are discussed for engineering this dispersive electric and magnetic TD-LM absorber artificially with a substrate that has an array of pairs of appropriately designed small coil-loaded dipole radiating elements embedded in it.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/12254/00564092.pdf","startPage":"656","endPage":"671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.564092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.564092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of Maxwellian absorbers for numerical boundary conditions and for practical applications using engineered artificial materials","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic materials","Conducting materials","Magnetization","Electromagnetic wave polarization","Dispersion","Slabs","Perfectly matched layers","Magnetic losses","Conductivity","Character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave polarisation","magnetic fields","electrical conductivity","dispersion (wave)","magnetic materials","magnetic anisotropy","dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Maxwellian absorbers design","numerical boundary conditions","practical applications","engineered artificial materials","perfectly matched layer","magnetization fields","polarization fields","passive lossy electric medium","passive lossy magnetic medium","conductivity","Debye dispersion characteristics","perfect electromagnetic absorber","absorption properties","time-derivative Lorentz material model","dispersive magnetic properties","dispersive electric properties","absorptive electric properties","absorptive magnetic properties","standard Lorentz material model","reflection coefficients","perfect electric conductor-backed slab","dipole antenna","broad bandwidth pulsed fields","coil loaded dipole radiating elements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"The design of Maxwellian absorbers for numerical boundary conditions and for practical applications using engineered artificial materials","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5561842","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of Maxwellian absorbers for numerical boundary conditions and for practical applications using engineered artificial materials","sourcePdf":"00564092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063816S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"56","articleId":"564092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":564093,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We propose an accurate method to determine jointly the azimuth and elevation angle and the delay of waves incoming at the receiver. The method is applied to measurements of the complex impulse response of the mobile radio channel, performed on a planar array placed on a mobile in an urban cellular environment. The directions-of-arrival (DOA) were obtained by the means of a direction finding algorithm-two-dimensional (2-D) unitary ESPRIT. Two-dimensional spatial smoothing as an extension of ordinary spatial smoothing is utilized to decorrelate coherent waves. The application of 2-D unitary ESPRIT increases the angular resolution over conventional Fourier analysis or the scattering function by an order of magnitude and overcomes difficulties due to secondary lobes. The time delay is determined from wideband channel sounder measurements. The results confirm some assumptions on propagation mechanisms: (1) the wave-guiding property of streets (canyon effect), which is especially pronounced for long-delayed paths; (2) the variation of the number of incoming waves with their excess delay-the larger the excess delay, the lower the number of paths comprising an echo in the power delay profile; (3) if a single path remains, the privileged DOA is the direction of the street; (4) the exponential part of the power delay profile due to scatterers all around the receiver; and (5) the elevation dependence or the impinging power. In the tested receiver locations, paths with elevations between 0/spl deg/ and 40/spl deg/ dominate, containing about 90% of the received power.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/12254/00564093.pdf","startPage":"672","endPage":"682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.564093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.564093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution 3-D direction-of-arrival determination for urban mobile radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation delay","Delay effects","Land mobile radio","Smoothing methods","Acoustic scattering","Radio communication","Azimuth","Receivers","Performance evaluation","Planar arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","land mobile radio","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","antenna arrays","transient response","smoothing methods","delays","telecommunication channels","signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution 3D DOA","direction of arrival","urban mobile radio","mobile radio channel","radio communication modeling","system design","elevation angle","azimuth","waves delay","receiver","complex impulse response measurements","planar array","urban cellular environment","direction finding algorithm","2D unitary ESPRIT","2D spatial smoothing","coherent waves decorrelation","angular resolution","scattering function","time delay","wideband channel sounder measurements","propagation mechanisms","power delay profile"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution 3-D direction-of-arrival determination for urban mobile radio","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5555094","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution 3-D direction-of-arrival determination for urban mobile radio","sourcePdf":"00564093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030766S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"133","articleId":"564093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":564094,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A considerable reduction in the scale of the DSP engine has been achieved by using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). To capture a satellite signal arriving from an unknown direction, a two-dimensional (2-D) spatial FFT signal processing provides orthogonal multibeam patterns on the broad side of a planar array antenna. The experimental results demonstrated the features of coarse acquisition and tracking of a signal arrival by selecting the strongest of the beams without assistance from direction finding sensors or microwave phase shifters.

It consists of a microstrip feed network designed to operate in dual standing and traveling-wave modes and provide uniform excitation to its elements with either mode. It, therefore, produces a uniform aperture distribution, regardless of the array element input impedances. The traveling wave propagates when radiating elements are matched, but resonant standing wave prevails if loads become mismatched. Since the feed network resonance does not alter the array excitation, it can be used in combination with the radiating patch resonance to broaden the impedance bandwidth. The physical reasons for such behaviors are explained and experimental verification are provided. The generalization of the concept to large arrays is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/8.564098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.564098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12254","startPage":"715","endPage":"722","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/12254/00564098.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564098","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Feeds","Microstrip antenna arrays","Impedance","Resonance","Microstrip antennas","Bandwidth","Microwave antenna arrays","Frequency","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antenna arrays","antenna feeds","impedance matching","antenna travelling wave arrays","electric impedance","antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-matching wideband feed network","microstrip feed network","microstrip antenna arrays","dual mode operation","uniform excitation","standing wave mode","traveling wave mode","uniform aperture distribution","array element input impedance","matched radiating elements","resonant standing waves","mismatched loads","feed network resonance","array excitation","radiating patch resonance","impedance bandwidth","experimental verification","large arrays","impedance matching","antenna radiation patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A self-matching wideband feed network for microstrip arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5555099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564098/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-matching wideband feed network for microstrip arrays","sourcePdf":"00564098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026393S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"564098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":564102,"authors":[{"name":"P.O.

We discuss joint encoder and channel rate control for variable bit-rate (VBR) video over packet-switched ATM networks. Since variable bit-rate traffic is allowed in such networks, an open-loop encoder without rate control can generate consistent quality video. However, in order to improve the statistical multiplexing gain (SMG), an encoder buffer is essential to meet traffic constraints imposed by networks and to smooth the highly variable video bitstream. Due to the finite buffer size, some forms of encoder rate control have to be enforced, and consequently, video quality varies. We argue that a rate control scheme has to balance both issues of consistent video quality on the encoder side and bitstream smoothness for the SMG on the network side. We present a joint encoder and channel rate control algorithm for ATM networks with leaky buckets as open-loop source flow control models. The algorithm considers constraints imposed by the encoder and decoder buffers, the leaky bucket control, traffic smoothing, and rate control. The encoder rate control is separated into a sustainable-rate control and a unidirectional instantaneous-rate control. It can improve the problem of leaky bucket saturation exhibited in previous works. Experimental results with MPEG video are presented. The results verify our analysis and show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint encoder and channel rate control of VBR video over ATM networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.564106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/12251/00564106.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.564106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Joint encoder and channel rate control of VBR video over ATM networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5563672","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint encoder and channel rate control of VBR video over ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00564106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047789S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"52","articleId":"564106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":564107,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Gark Choi","affiliation":["Video Communications Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Gark Choi","id":"38150797000"},{"name":"Si-Woong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Si-Woong Lee","id":"37067452300"},{"name":"Seong-Dae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong-Dae Kim","id":"37279272300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"564107","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":352},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Data mining","Image coding","MPEG 4 Standard","Shape","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Information filtering","Information filters","Image representation","Morphology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","brightness","mathematical morphology","filtering theory","image segmentation","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal video segmentation","joint similarity measure","morphological spatiotemporal segmentation algorithm","luminance information","motion information","morphological tools","morphological filters","watershed algorithm","joint marker extraction","boundary decision","motion based region fusion","homogeneous regions","redundant regions elimination","temporal information","spatial information","simulation results","video coding"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new morphological spatio-temporal segmentation algorithm.

Second, the spatio-temporal boundaries are decided by the watershed algorithm. For this purpose, a new joint similarity measure is proposed.

The segmentation part of the algorithm is interleaved with the estimation part in order to optimize the coding performance of the procedure. Furthermore, a technique is examined for propagating the segmentation information with time. A 3-D motion-compensated prediction technique is used for both intensity and depth image sequence coding. Error images and depth maps are encoded using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and Huffman methods. Alternately, an efficient wireframe depth modeling technique may be used to convey depth information to the receiver. Motion and wireframe model parameters are then quantized and transmitted to the decoder along with the segmentation information. As a straightforward application, the use of the depth map information for the generation of intermediate views at the receiver is also discussed.

The dominant motion is modeled by a global affine warping and estimated by a gradient-based estimation method. Two alternative algorithms are proposed for compensation of the dominant motion: a bilinear interpolation based on the affine model, and a projections onto convex sets (POCS) based method that takes into account blurring in the image formation. It is important to note that the latter must be used if the blurring is severe enough to act as an anti-alias filter, which imposes an irreversible limit on the resolution improvement ability of any motion-compensated filter. Global motion-compensated images are then input to a motion-adaptive filter to detect and correct for those pixels where there exists local motion. A dynamic thresholding for motion detection is presented, with weighted directional-filtering for regions where motion is detected, to obtain the best results. Experimental results with application to obtaining high quality stills from video camcorders demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/76.564111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/12251/00564111.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.564111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust methods for high-quality stills from interlaced video in the presence of dominant motion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Robust methods for high-quality stills from interlaced video in the presence of dominant motion","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5563677","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust methods for high-quality stills from interlaced video in the presence of dominant motion","sourcePdf":"00564111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059312S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"37","articleId":"564111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":564113,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In particular, we study the impact of code selection on the overall performance and provide a judicious code selection strategy. The use of FEC provides an active and powerful means of recovery from packet loss which is particularly useful when the encoded video material has high motion and scene changes. The best technique for applying FEC is to throttle the source coding rate so that the overall transmission rate after FEC application equals the original unprotected rate. However, the resulting performance then depends on the particular code selected. A well-chosen code provides good protection while allowing little sacrifice in quality and at the same time satisfies specified delay constraints. Our results show that a single code is generally insufficient to provide good performance under all operating conditions. However, a small group of codes can be preselected, using the efficient code-selection strategy described here, which will provide efficient and robust performance over a wide range of channel conditions. We show that this simple code selection strategy is sufficient to select codes judiciously for a wide range of operating conditions and constraints. Employing this selection strategy, we demonstrate that moderate length codes are sufficient to provide good performance while meeting the imposed delay constraint.","doi":"10.1109/76.564113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.564113","endPage":"376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/12251/00564113.pdf","startPage":"358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a transport coding scheme for high-quality video over ATM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564113/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a transport coding scheme for high-quality video over ATM networks","volume":"7","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5563679","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a transport coding scheme for high-quality video over ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00564113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034541S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"27","articleId":"564113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":564114,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

This paper presents a new FSVQ scheme, called finite-state residual vector quantization (FSRVQ), in which each state uses a residual vector quantizer (RVQ) to encode the input vector. This scheme differs from the conventional FSVQ in that the state-RVQ codebooks encode the residual vectors instead of the original vectors. A neural network predictor estimates the current block based on the four previously encoded blocks. The predicted vector is then used to identify the current state as well as to generate a residual vector (the difference between the current vector and the predicted vector). This residual vector is encoded using the current state-RVQ codebooks. A major task in designing our proposed FSRVQ is the joint optimization of the next-state codebook and the state-RVQ codebooks. This is achieved by introducing a novel tree-structured competitive neural network in which the first layer implements the next-state function, and each branch of the tree implements the corresponding state-RVQ. A joint training algorithm is also developed that mutually optimizes the next-state and the state-RVQ codebooks for the proposed FSBVQ. Joint optimization of the next-state function and the state-RVQ codebooks eliminates a large number of redundant states in the conventional FSVQ design; consequently, the memory requirements are substantially reduced in the proposed FSRVQ scheme. The proposed FSRVQ can be designed for high bit rates due to its very low memory requirements and the low search complexity of the state-RVQ's. Simulation results show that the proposed FSRVQ scheme outperforms conventional FSVQ schemes both in terms of memory requirements and the visual quality of the reconstructed image. The proposed FSRVQ scheme also outperforms JPEG (the current standard for still image compression) at low bit rates.","doi":"10.1109/76.564114","startPage":"377","endPage":"390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.564114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/12251/00564114.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-state residual vector quantization using a tree-structured competitive neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564114/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-state residual vector quantization using a tree-structured competitive neural network","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5563680","publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-state residual vector quantization using a tree-structured competitive neural network","sourcePdf":"00564114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05085S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","articleId":"564114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":564119,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Bum Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung Bum Pan","id":"37341876800"},{"name":"Rae-Hong Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Rae-Hong Park","id":"37267489900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"564119","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":157},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systolic arrays","Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete transforms","DH-HEMTs","Computer architecture","Frequency","Two dimensional displays","Speech coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic arrays","Hartley transforms","discrete cosine transforms","signal sampling","inverse problems","digital arithmetic","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT","DST","DHT","unified systolic arrays","discrete Hartley transform","discrete sine transform","discrete cosine transform","1D transforms","2D transforms","odd-numbered frequency sample","even-numbered frequency samples","latency","inverse DCT","inverse DST","inverse DHT","processing elements","algorithms"]}],"abstract":"We propose unified systolic arrays for computation of the one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) discrete cosine transform/discrete sine transform/discrete Hartley transform (DCT/DST/DHT).

This degradation is due to the fact that the sender must bear much of the complexity associated with reliable data transfer (e.g., maintaining state information and timers for each of the receivers and responding to receivers' ACKs). A potential solution to this problem is to shift the burden of providing reliable data transfer to the receivers-thus resulting in receiver-initiated multicast error control protocols based on the use of negative acknowledgments (NAKs). We determine the maximum throughputs for generic sender-initiated and receiver-initiated protocols for two classes of applications: (1) one-many applications where one participant sends data to a set of receivers and (2) many-many applications where all participants simultaneously send and receive data to/from each other. We show that a receiver-initiated error control protocol which requires receivers to transmit NAKs point-to-point to the sender provides higher throughput than a sender-initiated counterpart for both classes of applications. We further demonstrate that, in the case of a one many application, replacing point-to-point transfer of NAKs with multicasting of NAKs coupled with a random backoff procedure provides a substantial additional increase in the throughput of a receiver-initiated error control protocol over a sender-initiated protocol. We also find, however, that such a modification leads to a throughput degradation in the case of many-many applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/12252/00564137.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.564137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.564137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of sender-initiated and receiver-initiated reliable multicast protocols","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicast protocols","Throughput","Degradation","Error correction","Maintenance","Automatic repeat request","Wide area networks","Video sharing","Computational modeling","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","telecommunication channels","error correction","transport protocols","data communication","packet switching","receivers","transmitters","telecommunication network reliability","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sender-initiated reliable multicast protocols","receiver-initiated reliable multicast protocols","positive acknowledgments","performance degradation","reliable data transfer","state information","timers","receivers","multicast error control protocols","negative acknowledgments","maximum throughputs","one-many applications","many-many applications","receiver-initiated error control protocol","random backoff procedure","sender-initiated error control protocol","multicast transport protocols","packet transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of sender-initiated and receiver-initiated reliable multicast protocols","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5561235","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of sender-initiated and receiver-initiated reliable multicast protocols","sourcePdf":"00564137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044972S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"139","articleId":"564137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":564145,"authors":[{"name":"G.N.

Problems complicating the provision of multipoint, feedback-based real-time video service include: (1) implosion of feedback returning to the source as the number of multicast destinations increases and (2) variance in the amount of available bandwidth on different branches in the multipoint connection. A new service architecture is proposed for real-time multicast video, and two multipoint feedback mechanisms to support this service are introduced and studied. The mechanisms support a minimum bandwidth guarantee and the best effort support of video traffic exceeding the minimum rate. They both rely on adaptive, multilayered coding at the video source and closed-loop feedback from the network in order to control both the high and low priority video generation rates of the video encoder. Simulation results show that the studied feedback mechanisms provide, at the minimum, a quality of video comparable to a constant bit rate (CBR) connection reserving the same amount of bandwidth. When unutilized network bandwidth becomes available, the mechanisms are capable of exploiting it to dynamically improve video quality beyond the minimum guaranteed level.","doi":"10.1109/49.564146","startPage":"512","endPage":"530","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/12252/00564146.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.564146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback control mechanisms for real-time multipoint video services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","Bandwidth","Air traffic control","Bit rate","Communication system traffic control","Asynchronous transfer mode","Computer science","Traffic control","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time systems","asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication networks","telecommunication traffic","visual communication","video coding","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication channels","feedback","adaptive codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback control mechanisms","real-time multipoint video services","reactive congestion control","high video quality","channel utilization","point to multipoint video","ATM networks","feedback implosion","multicast destinations","bandwidth","multipoint connection","service architecture","real-time multicast video","multipoint feedback","video traffic","adaptive multilayered coding","video source","closed-loop feedback","video generation rates","video encoder","simulation results","constant bit rate connection","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Feedback control mechanisms for real-time multipoint video services","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5561244","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback control mechanisms for real-time multipoint video services","sourcePdf":"00564146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056838S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"44","articleId":"564146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":564148,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Yi Tzeng","affiliation":["ATM Networks Research Department, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Hong-Yi Tzeng","id":"37087207408"},{"name":"Kai-Yeung Sin","lastName":"Kai-Yeung Sin","id":"37086976890"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"564148","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564148","abstract":"In the ATM Forum activities, considerable efforts have focused on the congestion control of point-to-point available bit rate (ABR) service. We present a novel approach that extends existing point-to-point (unicast) congestion control protocols to a point-to-multipoint (multicast) environment. In particular, we establish a unified framework to derive a multicast congestion control protocol for an ABR service from a given rate-based unicast protocol. We generalize a known necessary and sufficient condition on the max-min fairness of unicast rate allocation for a multicast service. Using this condition, we show that the resulting multicast protocol derived using our framework preserves the fairness characteristics of the underlying unicast protocol. The practical significance of our approach is illustrated by extending a standard congestion control mechanism for an ABR service to a multicast environment. The performance of the resulting multicast protocol is examined using benchmark network configurations suggested by the traffic management subworking group at the ATM Forum, and simulation results are presented to substantiate our claims.","doi":"10.1109/49.564148","startPage":"545","endPage":"556","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/12252/00564148.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.564148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On max-min fair congestion control for multicast ABR service in ATM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asynchronous transfer mode","Communication system traffic control","Multicast protocols","Traffic control","Unicast","Bandwidth","Bit rate","Computer network management","Distributed computing","Communication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication network management","telecommunication traffic","protocols","telecommunication congestion control","minimax techniques","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["max-min fair congestion control","multicast ABR service","ATM Forum","point to point available bit rate service","point to point congestion control protocols","unicast congestion control protocols","multicast congestion control protocol","rate-based unicast protocol","sufficient condition","necessary condition","unicast rate allocation","performance","benchmark network configurations","traffic management subworking group","simulation results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"On max-min fair congestion control for multicast ABR service in ATM","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5561246","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On max-min fair congestion control for multicast ABR service in ATM","sourcePdf":"00564148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037833S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"76","articleId":"564148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":564157,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The pulse-based dead-time compensator (PBDTC) is less hardware- and software-intensive than other dead-time compensation methods providing a low-cost solution. The pulse-based technique is developed by analyzing the effects of dead time on a pulse-by-pulse basis and correcting each pulse accordingly. The technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. Other compensation methods are evaluated, and the results compared with the pulse-based technique.

However, when implemented using the principles which apply to voltage-source inverter PWM pattern generators, the switching frequency is equal to: (1) the carrier frequency in standard carrier-based implementations and (2) a function of the cycle frequency, sequence of space vectors, and selection of the zero space vector in space vector implementations. This paper shows that this frequency can be reduced to one-half of the respective frequencies. Two pattern generators are investigated: (1) an analog on-line carrier-based technique, namely, the modified dead-band technique and (2) a digital on-line space vector-based technique, where advantage is taken of the extra zero state available in current-source converters. It is shown that the switching frequency reduction is achieved with no penalty in the line current harmonic distortion. Moreover, a significant reduction of AC line current distortion is obtained with the modified dead-band technique for modulation indexes greater than 0.4. The principles of operation of the proposed schemes are explained, Experimental results on a 5 kVA current-source rectifier and a 5 kVA current-source inverter confirm the feasibility and features of the proposed pattern generators.","doi":"10.1109/41.564158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/12253/00564158.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.564158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12253","startPage":"198","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-source converter on-line pattern generator switching frequency minimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Current-source converter on-line pattern generator switching frequency minimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564158/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5547253","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-source converter on-line pattern generator switching frequency minimization","sourcePdf":"00564158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033724S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"133","articleId":"564158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":564159,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

SRMs are capable of functioning despite the presence of faults. Faults impart transient changes to machine inductances that are difficult to model analytically. After this transient period, SRMs are capable of functioning at a reduced level of performance. ANNs are applied for their well-known interpolation capabilities for highly nonlinear systems. A dynamical model for an SRM is constructed by feeding values for state variables back to ANN inputs. EAs are employed for their ability to search complex structural and parameter spaces to find good ANN solutions. Furthermore, the ANN structure and training regimen parameters are searched for using EAs. Finally, an analysis of the search is performed, and the resulting model is presented. The results of using the ANN-EA-based model to predict the performance characteristics of prototype SRM drive motion under normal and abnormal operating conditions are presented and verified by comparison to test data.","doi":"10.1109/41.564161","startPage":"226","endPage":"233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.564161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/12253/00564161.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling faulted switched reluctance motors using evolutionary neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564161/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling faulted switched reluctance motors using evolutionary neural networks","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5547256","publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling faulted switched reluctance motors using evolutionary neural networks","sourcePdf":"00564161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065462S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"28","articleId":"564161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":564168,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

We discuss fundamental properties, relations, and transform pairs of the three discrete ZT versions, and we summarize applications of these transforms. In particular, the discrete-time ZT and the cyclic discrete ZT are important for discrete-time Gabor (1946) expansion (Weyl-Heisenberg frame) theory since they diagonalize the Weyl-Heisenberg frame operator for critical sampling and integer oversampling. The polyphase representation plays a fundamental role in the theory of filter banks, especially DFT filter banks.

The approach has the following attractive features: it achieves O(N) complexity per scale, the filter coefficients can be analytically obtained by a simple integration, and the algorithm is faster than a least squares approach with negligible loss in accuracy. Our method is to use P wavelets per octave and to approximate them with their oblique projection onto a space defined by a compactly supported scaling function.

The coordinate registration process converts the group delays and azimuths (i.e., slant coordinates) from a set of multipath target returns to an estimate of its location (i.e., ground coordinates). This is performed by associating the target returns with ray modes determined using a computational electromagnetic propagation model. Not surprisingly, errors in the estimates of down-range ionosphere parameters can seriously degrade the accuracy of the target location estimate. The coordinate registration method presented is designed to achieve improved accuracy by employing a statistical model for uncertainties in the ionosphere. Modeling down-range ionospheric parameters as random variables with known statistics facilitates maximum likelihood (ML) target location estimation, which is more robust to errors in the measured ionospheric conditions. The statistics of down-range ionospheric parameters can be determined using current and historical soundings of the ionosphere. ML target localization consists of determining the most likely target ground coordinates over an ensemble of ionospheric conditions consistent with the data. For greater computational efficiency, the likelihood function is approximated by a hidden Markov model (HMM) for the probability of a sequence of observed slant coordinates given a hypothesized target location. The parameters of the HMM are determined via Monte Carlo execution of a ray tracing propagation model for random realizations of the ionosphere. A simulation study performed using a random ionospheric model derived from ionogram measurements made at Wallops Island suggests that the ML method can potentially achieve average absolute miss distances as much as five times better than a conventional coordinate registration technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Ionosphere","Maximum likelihood

This problem is of interest in a variety of applications, such as radar and sonar source localization. A vast number of estimation techniques have been proposed in the literature during the past two decades. Most of these can deliver consistent estimates only if the covariance matrix of the background noise is known. In many applications, the aforementioned assumption is unrealistic. Recently, a number of contributions have addressed the problem of signal parameter estimation in unknown noise environments based on various assumptions on the noise. Herein, a different approach is taken. We assume instead that the signals are partially known. The received signals are modeled as linear combinations of certain known basis functions. The exact maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the problem at hand is derived, as well as computationally more attractive approximation. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) on the estimation error variance is also derived and found to coincide with the CRB, assuming an arbitrary deterministic model and known noise covariance.","doi":"10.1109/78.564187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/12255/00564187.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"1004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.564187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood array processing in spatially correlated noise fields using parameterized signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564187/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood array processing in spatially correlated noise fields using parameterized signals","volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5556707","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood array processing in spatially correlated noise fields using parameterized signals","sourcePdf":"00564187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167032S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"92","articleId":"564187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":564188,"authors":[{"name":"P.D.

Spatial smoothing is a technique that can perform beamforming in such environments. This method can be incorporated into an adaptive algorithm, such as least mean squares (LMS), possibly altering the well-known performance characteristics of the algorithm. We discuss methods for combining spatial smoothing with the LMS algorithm in an array with a generalized side-lobe canceler (GSC) structure. The first of these methods is an electronic version of mechanically dithering the array. We show that this well-known method obeys a set of nonhomogeneous dynamical equations, resulting in a limit cycle that increases the misadjustment of the algorithm. The previously reported parallel spatial processing algorithm is also shown to have this increased misadjustment. We then introduce two methods that do not suffer from this misadjustment increase. We compare the methods' computational complexity and performance, in terms of stability and steady-state behavior, including weight misadjustment, GSC output power, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In conclusion, we find that the limit cycle of the first method can be avoided without any increase in complexity by using one of the new methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of the least mean squares algorithm combined with spatial smoothing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.564188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/12255/00564188.pdf","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.564188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","displayDocTitle":"The performance of the least mean squares algorithm combined with spatial smoothing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5556708","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of the least mean squares algorithm combined with spatial smoothing","sourcePdf":"00564188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05963S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","articleId":"564188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":564193,"authors":[{"name":"T.

For a general neural network conditional distribution model, we establish a fundamental information-theoretic connection, the equivalence of maximum PL estimation, and accumulated relative entropy (ARE) minimization, and obtain large sample properties of PL for the general case of dependent observations. As an example, the binary case with the sigmoidal perceptron as the probability model is presented. It is shown that the single and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models satisfy conditions for the equivalence of the two cost functions: ARE and negative log partial likelihood. The practical issue of their gradient descent minimization is then studied within the well-formed cost functions framework. It is shown that these are well-formed cost functions for networks without hidden units; hence, their gradient descent minimization is guaranteed to converge to a solution if one exists on such networks. The formulation is applied to adaptive channel equalization, and simulation results are presented to show the ability of the least relative entropy equalizer to realize complex decision boundaries and to recover during training from convergence at the wrong extreme in cases where the mean square error-based MLP equalizer cannot.","doi":"10.1109/78.564193","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/12255/00564193.pdf","startPage":"1051","endPage":"1064","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.564193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditional distribution learning with neural networks and its application to channel equalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Conditional distribution learning with neural networks and its application to channel equalization","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5556713","publicationDate":"April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditional distribution learning with neural networks and its application to channel equalization","sourcePdf":"00564193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072349S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","articleId":"564193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":564196,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this system, two MORRPH boards are used to perform the \"early\" processing, including: field-of-view operators, light-intensity monitoring, shading correction background extraction, color-quantization, gray-scale channel generation, and histogram generation. This functionality utilizes the following MORRPH board features: open support sockets are filled with various SRAMs depending on necessary requirements, functionality is time-multiplexed by reprogramming the FPGAs, one of three I/O Busses is used for high-bandwidth input of color camera data, the ISA Bus interface is used for low-bandwidth output of histogram data, user-programmable ports allow simple modification of operating parameters. The use of two MORRPH boards to perform the early processing provides almost 200 times the overall system throughput when compared to a system that used two 486-based PCs to perform the \"early\" processing.","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel3/4230/12265/00564738.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1996.564738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1996.564738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using MORRPH in an industrial machine vision system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","sorting","industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MORRPH","industrial machine vision system","FPGA-based CCM","color sorting problem","furniture manufacturing industry","wooden samples classification","field-of-view operators","light-intensity monitoring","shading correction background extraction","color-quantization","gray-scale channel generation","histogram generation","FPGAs","ISA Bus interface","modular reprogrammable real time processing hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Using MORRPH in an industrial machine vision system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5485126","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using MORRPH in an industrial machine vision system","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00564738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038656S","chronDate":"17-19 Apr 1996","isNumber":"12265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4230","citationCount":"7","articleId":"564738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":564741,"authors":[{"name":"Isshiki","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Isshiki","id":"37270643100"},{"name":"Dai","affiliation":["Computer Engineer, Applied Sciences Building, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Dai","id":"37275529500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7548-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"564741","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":67,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","adaptive filters","field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-serial pipeline synthesis","multi-FPGA systems","C++ design capture","large-scale configurable system","FPGA technology","high-level design entry support","computational algorithms","bit-serial pipeline networks","DSP applications","2D filters","adaptive filters","inverse discrete cosine transform","digital neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564741","abstract":"Developing applications for a large-scale configurable system composed of state-of-the-art FPGA technology is a grand challenge.

Without a careful circuit implementation strategy, one would waste a large portion of the potential capacity of the configurable hardware. Also, high-level design entry support is essential for such large-scale hardware. A C++ design tool has been implemented which maps the computational algorithms onto bit-serial pipeline networks which exhibit high performance and maximize the device utilization of each FPGA. With this tool, the designer is able to develop applications in a very short time, and also is able to try out different algorithm implementations easily to see the trade-offs in terms of performance and hardware size instantaneously. Based on this C++ design tool, a number of DSP applications such as 1D and 2D filters, adaptive filters, Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform, and digital neural networks were designed.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1996.564741","publicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel3/4230/12265/00564741.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1996.564741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-serial pipeline synthesis for multi-FPGA systems with C++ design capture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Bit-serial pipeline synthesis for multi-FPGA systems with C++ design capture","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5485128","conferenceDate":"17-19 April 1996","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-serial pipeline synthesis for multi-FPGA systems with C++ design capture","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00564741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040609S","chronDate":"17-19 Apr 1996","isNumber":"12265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4230","citationCount":"5","articleId":"564741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":564749,"authors":[{"name":"Villasenor","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Villasenor","id":"37272280100"},{"name":"Schoner","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Schoner","id":"37283972500"},{"name":"Kang-Ngee Chia","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kang-Ngee Chia","id":"38298824800"},{"name":"Zapata","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zapata","id":"38313860600"},{"name":"Hea Joung Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hea Joung Kim","id":"38331876200"},{"name":"Jones","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jones","id":"37279349600"},{"name":"Lansing","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lansing","id":"38342532000"},{"name":"Mangione-Smith","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Mangione-Smith","id":"38323041300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7548-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"564749","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":157,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","object recognition","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configurable computing solutions","automatic target recognition","FPGAs","bit-level operations","ATR target templates","design tools","implementation strategies"]}],"abstract":"FPGAs can be used to build systems for automatic target recognition (ATR) that achieve an order of magnitude increase in performance over systems built using general purpose processors.

Device resources are allocated to controlling and describing the computation on a per task basis.

The adaptability is made possible by a multi-level configuration scheme, a unified configurable network supporting both datapaths and instruction distribution, and a coarse-grained building block which can serve as an instruction store, a memory element, or a computational element. In a 0.5 /spl mu/ CMOS process, the 8-bit functional unit at the heart of the MATRIX architecture has a footprint of roughly 1.5 mm/spl times/1.2 mm, making single dies with over a hundred function units practical today.

It is well documented that the execution of large sections of a program within the \"virtual hardware\" offered by an attached FPGA processor can provide substantial speedup over the ordinary execution within a sequential, general-purpose processor. Unfortunately, the development tools currently available for FPGAs do not allow for easily configuring multi-FPGA custom computing machines. Configuration of an FPGA architecture requires scheduling: the mapping of computations onto existing functional units. To take advantage of all available logic, computations may span processing elements, calling for partitioning of a subroutine between one or more FPGAs.

An abstract field programmable gate array model is used to investigate the area and delay characteristics of arithmetic circuits implemented on FPGA architectures to determine the potential speedup of FPGA-based coprocessors. Analysis shows that integrated FPGA arrays are suitable as coprocessor platforms for realising algorithms that require only limited numbers of multiplication instructions. Inherent FPGA characteristics limit the data-path widths that can be supported efficiently for these applications.

The hardware implementation requires 4 FPGA's on a Splash 2 board and runs at 11 MHz. The software implementation was written in C++ and executed on a 125 MHz HP PA-RISC workstation. The software run time was more than four times that of the hardware (up to 50 times as many cycles). The paper analyses the contribution made to this performance difference by the following hardware features: hard-wired control, custom address generation logic, memory hierarchy efficiency, and both fine- and course-grained parallelism. The results indicate that the major contributor to the hardware performance advantage is fine-grained parallelism-RTL-level parallelism due to operator pipelining. This alone accounts for as much as a 38X cycle-count reduction over the software in one section of the algorithm. The next major contributors include hard-wired control and custom address generation which account for as much as a 3X speedup in other sections of the algorithm. Finally, memory hierarchy inefficiencies in the software (cache misses and paging) and coarse-grained parallelism in the hardware are each shown to have lesser effect on the performance difference between the implementations.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1996.564847","publicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel3/4230/12265/00564847.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1996.564847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms in software and in hardware-a performance analysis of workstation and custom computing machine implementations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms in software and in hardware-a performance analysis of workstation and custom computing machine implementations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5485146","publicationDate":"1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564847/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Apr 1996","conferenceDate":"17-19 April 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms in software and in hardware-a performance analysis of workstation and custom computing machine implementations","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00564847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029487S","chronDate":"17-19 Apr 1996","isNumber":"12265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4230","citationCount":"40","articleId":"564847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":564866,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

Incident energy levels are correlated with second degree burn criteria for unprotected human skin.

We examine a mechanism that gives rise to self-similar network traffic and discuss performance. The mechanism we study is the transfer of files or messages whose size is drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. In a realistic client/server network the degree to which file sizes are heavy-tailed can directly determine the degree of traffic self-similarity at the link level. This causal relationship is robust relative to changes in network resources, network topology, the influence of cross-traffic, and the distribution of interarrival times. Properties of the transport layer play an important role in preserving and modulating this relationship. The reliable transmission and flow control mechanisms of TCP serve to maintain the long-range dependency structure induced by heavy-tailed file size distributions. In contrast, if a non-flow-controlled and unreliable (UDP-based) transport protocol is used, the resulting traffic shows little self-similarity: although still bursty at short time scales, it has little long-range dependence. Performance implications of self-similarity are discussed as represented by various performance measures. Increased self-similarity as expected, results in degradation of performance. Queueing delay, in particular is discussed. Throughput-related measures such as packet loss and retransmission rate, however increase only gradually with increasing traffic self-similarity as long as reliable, flow-controlled transport protocol is used.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1996 International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP-96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4203/12260/00564935.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1996 International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP-96)","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.1996.564935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.1996.564935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12260","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=564935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the relationship between file sizes, transport protocols, and self-similar network traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transport protocols","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Local area networks","Wide area networks","File servers","Network servers","Communication system traffic control","Robustness","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication traffic","transport protocols","network topology","local area networks","wide area networks","performance evaluation","queueing theory","client-server systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file sizes","transport protocols","self-similar network traffic","LAN","WAN","performance","message","heavy-tailed distribution","realistic client/server network","network topology","network resource","interarrival times","transport layer","long-range dependency structure","performance measures","queueing delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/564935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"On the relationship between file sizes, transport protocols, and self-similar network traffic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5577035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the relationship between file sizes, transport protocols, and self-similar network traffic","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00564935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042581S","chronDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203","citationCount":"103","articleId":"564935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":565249,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

In this problem, one learns to input a maze description, and output a policy or value function, without having to relearn the policy when one encounters a new maze.

The problem is formalized as a constraint problem. In this paper, we present genetic algorithms to minimize the data transmission costs required for a distributed set query processing. Few approaches to the constraints problem in genetic algorithms have previously been proposed. One of them uses penalty functions as an adjustment to the optimized problem. However, our approach is based on appropriate data structures and incorporates the constraints into chromosomes. Simulations have been performed on a distributed database system with up to 700 nodes. The performance evaluation is carried out and compared among different algorithms.

A coin recognition system in this paper includes as a preprocessor the Fourier transform, which produces rotation invariant features. Those features are recognized by a multilayered neural network. The GA is utilized to reduce the number of input signals, Fourier spectra, into the neural network.

Although executing SPMD tasks on coarse-grained heterogeneous systems yields a cost-effective solution, heterogeneity introduces more complexity in data partitioning, mapping, and scheduling problems. In this paper, three image data partitioning schemes for parallel image processing in heterogeneous systems are investigated and implemented using the parallel virtual machine message passing library. The partitioning schemes are based on the system characteristics (processing capability) incorporated within the distributed computing primitives (DCP) environment using SpecInt92 benchmark and our DCP-based benchmark. We compare the results with the baseline (Eq-based) scheme that equally partitions images regardless of processing speed. The results from the experiments show that the DCP-based partitioning scheme outperforms the Eq-based and Spec-based schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.565508","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

The system can accomplish the following tasks: 1) obtain enhanced boundaries; 2) recover missing edges; and 3) eliminate false edges caused by noise. The research comprises two phases, namely, boundary extraction by a BP net and boundary enhancement by a modified Hopfield neural network. The BP net is trained by 560 typical boundary patterns to enable the network to determine the boundary elements with 8 orientations and to provide the boundary measurement for further processing. A modified Hopfield net is proposed to enhance boundary measurement. Based on constraint satisfaction and the competitive mechanism, interconnection between neural cells are determined. A criteria is provided to find the final stable result which contains the enhanced boundary measurement. The neural network was simulated on a SUN Sparc station. Test images were degraded by random noise up to 30% of the original images. Comparing with the Gaussian edge detection and optimum edge detection, the results are very promising: boundaries were extracted, noise was eliminated, and boundary elements missed in other methods were detected.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.565514","pdfPath":"/iel3/4232/12283/00565514.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2275 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

Unfortunately, such heterogeneity makes the development and maintenance of applications that make the best use of such networks difficult. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture specification created by the Object Management Group provides a stable model for distributed object-oriented systems that helps developers cope with heterogeneity and inevitable change. Applications written to the CORBA standard are abstracted away from underlying networking protocols and transports, instead relying on object request brokers to provide a fast and flexible communication and object activation substrated. The abstractions provided by CORBA ORBs are currently serving as the basis for applications in a wide variety of problem domains, including telecommunications, finance, medicine, and manufacturing, running on platforms ranging from mainframes down to test and measurement equipment. This article first provides an overview of the Object Management Architecture, then describes in detail the CORBA component of that architecture, and concludes with a description of the OMG organization along with some of its current and future work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CORBA: integrating diverse applications within distributed heterogeneous environments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.565655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/12278/00565655.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.565655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=565655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/565655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1997","displayDocTitle":"CORBA: integrating diverse applications within distributed heterogeneous environments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","accessionNumber":"5523036","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CORBA: integrating diverse applications within distributed heterogeneous environments","sourcePdf":"00565655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035389S","chronDate":"Feb.  1997","isNumber":"12278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"374","articleId":"565655","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":565667,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Multitier networks are useful when there are a multitude of traffic types with drastically different parameters and/or different requirements, such as different mobility parameters or quality-of-service requirements. In such situations, it may be cost-effective to build a multitude of cellular infrastructures, each serving a particular traffic type. The network resources (e.g., the radio channels) are then partitioned among the multitude of tiers. In general terms, we are interested in quantifying the cost reduction due to the multitier network design, as opposed to a single-tier network.

Modern networks are becoming mobile networks which must accommodate a broad range services with differing mobility characteristics. Consequently, there is an impetus to understand mobility and its effect on communications systems. Of particular interest are the unique stresses imposed by mobile computing and especially mobile computer programs (agents). As an aid to greater understanding, we propose a theoretical framework for the study of mobility tracking based on user/service/host location probability distributions. We show how this methodology, using stochastic ordering and information theory, can enable quantitative comparison of various mobility management schemes as well as insight into the mobility tracking problem over a wide range of mobility characteristics. This general approach should aid both applications and future research.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Mobile computing","Databases","Computer networks","Communication systems","Stress","Probability distribution","Stochastic processes","Information theory","Mobile radio mobility management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking","computer network management","software agents","knowledge based systems","stochastic processes","information theory","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location uncertainty","mobile networks","communications systems","mobile computing","mobile computer programs","agents","mobility tracking","stochastic ordering","information theory","mobility management schemes"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.565669","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/12278/00565669.pdf","doi":"10.1109/35.565669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location uncertainty in mobile networks: a theoretical framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Location uncertainty in mobile networks: a theoretical framework","accessionNumber":"5523042","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","volume":"35","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/565669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location uncertainty in mobile networks: a theoretical framework","sourcePdf":"00565669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053478S","chronDate":"Feb.  1997","isNumber":"12278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"45","articleId":"565669","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":565813,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.

For each of these clusters we execute a bus generation algorithm which schedules bus accesses in order to minimize the total communication costs. Other than previous approaches, we infer RAM, if necessary, and consider data-dependencies as well as periodic execution of processes, like in VHDL. An example demonstrates the efficiency of the developed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISSS.1996.565880","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th International Symposium on Systems Synthesis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th International Symposium on Systems Synthesis","pdfPath":"/iel3/4200/12259/00565880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSS.1996.565880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12259","startPage":"65","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bus-based communication synthesis on system-level","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=565880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bus-based communication synthesis on system-level","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/565880/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5450814","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bus-based communication synthesis on system-level","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00565880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032975S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4200","citationCount":"28","articleId":"565880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":565886,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is designed for efficiency maximization. It consists of two ANN for estimation of speed and torque, and efficiency optimization. The first neural network (ANN1) is trained to estimate speed and torque of the machine to use in the feedback loop of the control system. The second neural network (ANN2) is used for commanding optimum voltage and frequency that maximizes the drive efficiency. ANN1 has been trained with the data obtained using the machine model operating under different speed, load, temperature and flux density. To provide the required data to train and test ANN2, a simulation program was written to calculate commanded voltage and frequency that would drive the induction machine with maximum efficiency at different load, speed, and temperature conditions. The controller is able to control the induction machine over a wide speed range from standstill to high speeds in the flux weakening region. The trained neural networks are employed for the control of a 7.5 kW induction machine under different loads. The proposed controller is an appropriate technique for speed sensor-less control of an induction machine to drive an electric vehicle (EV). The performance of this control system has been found to be as good as those controllers which use the induction machine model. The description of the control system, training procedure of the neural network are also given. The test results obtained for a torque control scheme suitable for the control of an EV is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/565922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","conferenceDate":"24-25 Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5490470","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new technique for highly efficient sensor-less control of electric vehicles by using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new technique for highly efficient sensor-less control of electric vehicles by using neural networks","confLoc":"Dearborn, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00565922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032197S","chronDate":"24-25 Oct. 1996","isNumber":"12201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261","citationCount":"2","articleId":"565922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":565934,"authors":[{"name":"L.

By using the optimum SP, failures can be sensitively detected and the failure types can be distinguished. However, there is no acceptable method for extracting the optimum SP. In order to overcome this difficulty and insure highly accurate failure diagnosis, in this paper, a new method called \"self-reorganization of symptom parameters\" has been proposed by using genetic algorithms (GA). And the new method can also be applied to other pattern recognition problems. By applying the method to many practices, the optimum SP can be quickly discovered. Several examples show that this method is very effective.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Machinery","Pattern recognition","Signal processing","Computer science","Genetic engineering","Systems engineering and theory","Length measurement","Medical diagnosis","Acoustic sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","genetic algorithms","parameter estimation","machine testing","electric machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-reorganization method","symptom parameters identification","failure diagnosis","genetic algorithms","plant rotating machinery","pattern recognition problems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.1996.565985","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4195/12282/00565985.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"835 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1996.565985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-reorganization method of symptom parameters for failure diagnosis by genetic algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=565985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Self-reorganization method of symptom parameters for failure diagnosis by genetic algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/565985/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5533792","conferenceDate":"9-9 Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-reorganization method of symptom parameters for failure diagnosis by genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00565985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030803S","chronDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195","citationCount":"1","articleId":"565985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":565986,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Generally, the motor system has nonlinearities in friction, load disturbance and magnetic saturation. It is necessary to treat the nonlinearities for improving performance in servo control. An FNN can be applied to control and identify a nonlinear dynamical system by learning capability. In this study, at first, a robust speed controller is developed by Lyapunov stability theory. However, the control input has discontinuity which generates an inherent chattering. To solve the problem and to improve the performances, an FNN is introduced to convert the discontinuous input to a continuous one in error boundary. The FNN is applied to identify the inverse dynamics of the motor and to control using coordination of feedforward control combined with inverse motor dynamics identification. The proposed controller is developed for an SR (switched reluctance) motor which has high nonlinearities and it is compared with MRAC (model reference adaptive controller). Experiments on the SR motor illustrate the validity of the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1996.565997","startPage":"898","endPage":"903 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4195/12282/00565997.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1996.565997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A speed control of motor systems with a feedforward neural network-its application to SR motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Velocity control","Reluctance motors","Fuzzy control","Servomotors","Control nonlinearities","Strontium","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Motor drives","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","neurocontrollers","feedforward neural nets","velocity control","control system synthesis","power engineering computing","Lyapunov methods","stability","learning (artificial intelligence)","controllers","model reference adaptive control systems","reluctance motor drives","machine theory","nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speed control","speed controller","feedforward neural network","switched reluctance motor","friction nonlinearities","load disturbance nonlinearities","magnetic saturation nonlinearities","servo control","nonlinear dynamical system","learning capability","robust speed controller","Lyapunov stability theory","inherent chattering","discontinuous input","continuous input","error boundary","feedforward control","inverse motor dynamics identification","model reference adaptive controller","MRAC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/565997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A speed control of motor systems with a feedforward neural network-its application to SR motor","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-9 Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5539889","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A speed control of motor systems with a feedforward neural network-its application to SR motor","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00565997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044163S","chronDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195","citationCount":"1","articleId":"565997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":565998,"authors":[{"name":"Q.P.

This modeling approach has been applied to various PWM converters, boost, buck and buck-boost types, operating in the discontinuous conduction mode, and the results are verified.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12282","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4195/12282/00566018.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1996.566018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1996.566018","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1022 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral modeling of switched-mode power converters in discontinuous conduction mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566018/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral modeling of switched-mode power converters in discontinuous conduction mode","conferenceDate":"9-9 Aug. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5539910","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral modeling of switched-mode power converters in discontinuous conduction mode","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00566018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031749S","chronDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195","citationCount":"2","articleId":"566018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566022,"authors":[{"name":"T.-F.

The robust controller which is based on a disturbance observer compensates disturbances due to parameter variations, mechanical nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. In doing so, it provides robustness and makes the whole system stable, and makes easy to design learning controllers which acquire good performance. A novel iterative learning control scheme comprising a unique feedforward learning controller and a robust controller is presented. In this paper, two kinds of learning controller are designed: firstly, the learning controller solves the zero initial problem; secondly, it solves the nonzero initial position problem. The convergence and robustness of the proposed controller is proved by a method based on Lyapunov stability theorem. The results of numerical simulation are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Robot control","Manipulator dynamics","Control nonlinearities","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Control systems","Convergence","Robust stability","Lyapunov method","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","robust control","learning systems","control system synthesis","observers","feedforward","control system analysis","Lyapunov methods","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot manipulators","robust learning control algorithm","disturbance observer","parameter variations","control design","disturbance compensation","mechanical nonlinearities","unmodeled dynamics","control simulation","external disturbances","control performance","zero initial problem","nonzero initial position problem","convergence","robustness","Lyapunov stability theorem","numerical simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566063","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1996.566063","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4195/12282/00566063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1996.566063","startPage":"1276","endPage":"1282 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12282","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust learning control for robot manipulators based on disturbance observer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust learning control for robot manipulators based on disturbance observer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","conferenceDate":"9-9 Aug. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5533831","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust learning control for robot manipulators based on disturbance observer","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00566063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039592S","chronDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195","citationCount":"14","articleId":"566063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566084,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For realizing DBF, there are three important technologies, phase detection technology, multi-beam forming technology and adaptive beam forming technology. In order to establish these key technologies, the DBF array test equipment was manufactured. These technologies and the data of the test equipment are presented. In order to realize high DBF performance, it is necessary to convert antenna element signals to digital signals with high accuracy. In order to solve this problem, an IF (intermediate frequency) direct sampling phase detection method is used with uniquely developed LSI. Regarding multi-beam forming, very high speed circuits are necessary in a radar application. The systolic array method is applied. In the systolic array, arbitrary and independently controlled multi-beams can be formed by controlling complex weights of each beam. In the DBF technology, an adaptive technique can easily be applied. The systolic array using the Gram-Schmidt transformation method is applied. This adaptive circuit was developed and tested in an open site. The jammers were transmitted and the antenna patterns were measured before and after adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/PAST.1996.566090","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/4211/12262/00566090.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAST.1996.566090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of DBF radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566090/","displayDocTitle":"Development of DBF radars","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5614334","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of DBF radars","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00566090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029315S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4211","citationCount":"8","articleId":"566090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":566100,"authors":[{"name":"U.R.O.

This effect is distinct for mainbeam jammers. With an adaptive array that uses the subarray outputs one can, in principle, correct this bias. The previously developed correction formula for element adaptive arrays are generalized to subarray output arrays with arbitrary sum and difference patterns, e.g., for patterns with low sidelobes. We assume that a low sidelobe sum beam is formed by element tapering and low sidelobe difference beams are formed by subarray output weighting. The bias can be further reduced by switching the beams at the subarray level to the estimated direction and repeating the procedure. This is called the multistep monopulse procedure.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAST.1996.566100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12262","startPage":"283","endPage":"288","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/4211/12262/00566100.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monopulse estimation with subarray output adaptive beamforming and low sidelobe sum and difference beams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Monopulse estimation with subarray output adaptive beamforming and low sidelobe sum and difference beams","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5614344","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monopulse estimation with subarray output adaptive beamforming and low sidelobe sum and difference beams","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00566100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034114S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4211","citationCount":"5","articleId":"566100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":566115,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

A multifunction radar (MFR) with a single rotating or multiple fixed phased array antennas is often the key element in this sensor suite because it can perform not only surveillance functions but also missile support. Since the MFR must be able to execute multiple functions concurrently, a scheduling mechanism is required that allocates the time and energy resources of the MFR to the radar functions in such a way that the overall performance of the sensor suite is optimized. This paper describes an efficient scheduling algorithm that is able to schedule the dwell requests of each function on the basis of their priority and transmission window. Some results are shown of the scheduling algorithm in a typical scenario in which a number of seaskimmers is engaged by semi-active surface-to-air missiles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566115/","accessionNumber":"5614359","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient scheduling algorithm for a multifunction radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient scheduling algorithm for a multifunction radar","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00566115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047196S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4211","citationCount":"42","articleId":"566115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":566128,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

By delivering very high bandwidth-thousands of times higher than standard Ethernet-at low latencies, Spider is ideal for CPU interconnect applications, high-end network switches, or high-performance graphics interconnects. The Spider chip design drew on the principles of computer communications architecture. Isolation between the physical, data link, and message layers led to a well-structured design that is transportable and more easily verified than a nonlayered solution. Because the chip implements all layers in hardware, latency is very low. Thus, we could realize the benefits of layering without sacrificing performance.","doi":"10.1109/40.566196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel1/40/12299/00566196.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/40.566196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12299","startPage":"34","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spider: a high-speed network interconnect","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spider: a high-speed network interconnect","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566196/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1997","accessionNumber":"5502598","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spider: a high-speed network interconnect","sourcePdf":"00566196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025127S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","isNumber":"12299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"159","articleId":"566196","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566199,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

We are currently developing 0.5-micron CMOS transmitter and receiver circuits that use active equalization to overcome the frequency-dependent attenuation of copper lines. The circuits will operate at 4 Gbps over up to 6 meters of 24AWG twisted pair or up to 1 meter of 5-mil 0.5-oz. PC trace. In addition to frequency-dependent attenuation, timing uncertainty (skew and jitter) and receiver bandwidth are also major obstacles to high-data rates. To address all of these issues, we've given our system the following characteristics: An active transmitter equalizer compensates for the frequency-dependent attenuation of the transmission line. The system performs closed-loop clock recovery independently for each signal line in a manner that cancels all clock and data skew and the low-frequency components of clock jitter. The delay line that generates the transmit and receive clocks (a 400-MHz clock with 10 equally spaced phases) uses several circuit techniques to achieve a total simulated jitter of less than 20 ps in the presence of supply and substrate noise. A clocked receive amplifier with a 50-ps aperture time senses the signal during the center of the eye at the receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566199/","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5502600","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter equalization for 4-Gbps signaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter equalization for 4-Gbps signaling","sourcePdf":"00566199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033613S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","isNumber":"12299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"101","articleId":"566199","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":566245,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Application of the proposed algorithm to subband motion estimation is studied and simulation results demonstrate that great improvement in performance can be obtained with similar computational complexity as the MAD measure.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP'96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4274/12308/00566275.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1062 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP'96)","doi":"10.1109/ICSIGP.1996.566275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIGP.1996.566275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution motion compensation coding for video compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Video compression","Motion estimation","Computational complexity","Distortion measurement","Redundancy","Video coding","Computational modeling","Video sequences","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","motion compensation","motion estimation","computational complexity","image resolution","data compression","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution motion compensation coding","video compression","subband motion estimation","block matching algorithms","temporal redundancy","video coding","mean squared error","MSE","mean absolute difference","computational complexity","multiple candidates approach","simulation results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution motion compensation coding for video compression","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5644438","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution motion compensation coding for video compression","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00566275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026336S","chronDate":"14-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4274","articleId":"566275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":566339,"authors":[{"name":"Jiehui Yuan","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jiehui Yuan","id":"37859850000"},{"name":"Yuanlong Cai","lastName":"Yuanlong Cai","id":"37086997335"},{"name":"Zhenggang Wei","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Zhenggang Wei","id":"37851170100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2912-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"566339","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Image edge detection","Data mining","Image reconstruction","Transform coding","PSNR","Discrete cosine transforms","Humans","Visual system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image reconstruction","edge detection","data compression","transform coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","visual primary component model","biorthogonal wavelet transform","LoG operator","edge information","residual image","ringing effect","hybrid scheme","PSNR","visual quality","image compression","image reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a visual primary component (VPC) model is proposed.

The aim of the project was to demonstrate the automatic detection and localisation of traffic signs along the roads, in order to trigger the selective acquisition of a high resolution digital picture for sign inventory purpose. A Kalman tracker has been implemented to localise the signs (in 3D) from their apparent motion within the field of view of a wide angle camera, taking into account the camera motion. The whole image processing chain has been tuned on synthetic road-scene image sequences of a custom virtual circuit then validated in the field on the real vehicle demonstrator using the motion information of the embedded inertial navigation system. The results obtained show the successful coupling of an inertial navigation system, providing an accurate camera motion information, with a real time image processing system performing multi-target detection and tracking. It is shown how this application takes advantage of the Kalman filter implementation as an optimal estimator in the case of a moving camera analysing a static scene.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1996.566368","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Conference on Intelligent Vehicles","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Conference on Intelligent Vehicles","pdfPath":"/iel3/4275/12309/00566368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1996.566368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12309","startPage":"141","endPage":"146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic signs localisation for highways inventory from a video camera on board a moving collection van","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Traffic signs localisation for highways inventory from a video camera on board a moving collection van","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566368/","conferenceDate":"19-20 Sept. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5501589","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic signs localisation for highways inventory from a video camera on board a moving collection van","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00566368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026419S","chronDate":"19-20 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275","citationCount":"14","articleId":"566368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566369,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

The project consists of two parts: lane extraction and obstacle detection. Our lane extraction system is based on a parameterized model for the appearance of the lanes in the images. This model captures the position, orientation and width of the lane as well as the height and inclination of the stereo rig with respect to the road. A robust lane recognition procedure is employed to recover the position of the vehicle within the lane. This scheme is able to recover and track the lane markers in real time (20 Hz) even in the presence of a significant number of spurious lane features. We have developed a new real time stereo system (20 Hz) that has been optimized for use in a highway navigation system. The algorithm first extracts vertical line features from a subset of the scan lines in the left and right images. Correspondences are made between line features in the left and right images by a region-based correlation scheme. The results of this process can then be passed to the grouping and tracking process. The paper also describes the implementation of these algorithms on our network of TMS320C40 DSPs. This computational architecture allows us to handle the demanding computational and I/O requirements of these applications. These algorithms have been tested on video data obtained from a test vehicle that was driven in typical highway traffic. Results from these experiments are presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1996.566379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12309","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Conference on Intelligent Vehicles","pdfPath":"/iel3/4275/12309/00566379.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time approach to stereopsis and lane-finding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"A real-time approach to stereopsis and lane-finding","conferenceDate":"19-20 Sept. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5501600","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time approach to stereopsis and lane-finding","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00566379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060825S","chronDate":"19-20 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275","citationCount":"43","articleId":"566379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":566380,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We propose supplementing the conventional instruction cache with a trace cache. This structure caches traces of the dynamic instruction stream, so instructions that are otherwise noncontiguous appear contiguous. For the Instruction Benchmark Suite (IBS) and SPEC92 integer benchmarks, a 4 kilobyte trace cache improves performance on average by 28% over conventional sequential fetching.

On the SPEC95 benchmarks, path profiling overhead averaged 31%, as compared to 16% for efficient edge profiling.

In some situations, resource allocation can be better optimized if a confidence level is assigned to a branch prediction; i.e. if the quantity of resources allocated is a function of the confidence level. To support such optimizations, we consider hardware mechanisms that partition conditional branch predictions into two sets: those which are accurate a relatively high percentage of the time, and those which are accurate a relatively low percentage of the time. The objective is to concentrate as many of the mispredictions as practical into a relatively small set of low confidence dynamic branches. We first study an ideal method that profiles branch predictions and sorts static branches into high and low confidence sets, depending on the accuracy with which they are dynamically predicted. We find that about 63 percent of the mispredictions can be localized to a set of static branches that account for 20 percent of the dynamic branches. We then study idealized dynamic confidence methods using both one and two levels of branch correctness history. We find that the single level method performs at least as well as the more complex two level method and is able to isolate 89 percent of the mispredictions into a set containing 20 percent of the dynamic branches. Finally, we study practical, less expensive implementations and find that they achieve most of the performance of the idealized methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assigning confidence to conditional branch predictions","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture.

Instruction prefetch algorithms attempt to reduce the performance degradation by bringing lines into the instruction cache before they are needed by the CPU fetch unit. There have been several algorithms proposed to do this, most notably next line prefetching and target prefetching. We propose a new scheme called wrong-path prefetching which combines next-line prefetching with the prefetching of all control instruction targets regardless of the predicted direction of conditional branches. The algorithm substantially reduces the cycles lost to instruction cache misses while somewhat increasing the amount of memory traffic. Wrong-path prefetching performs better than the other prefetch algorithms studied in all of the cache configurations examined while requiring little additional hardware. For example, the best wrong-path prefetch algorithm can result in a speed up of 16% when using an 8 K instruction cache. In fact, an 8 K wrong-path prefetched instruction cache is shown to achieve the same miss rate as a 32 K non-prefetch cache. Finally, it is shown that wrong-path prefetching is applicable to both multi-issue and long L1 miss latency machines.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1996.566459","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture.

This paper proposes a new technique-value prediction-for exceeding that limit that allows data dependent instructions to issue and execute in parallel without violating program semantics. This technique is built on the concept of value locality which describes the likelihood of the recurrence of a previously-seen value within a storage location inside a computer system. Value prediction consists of predicting entire 32- and 64-bit register values based on previously-seen values. We find that such register values being written by machine instructions are frequently predictable. Furthermore, we show that simple microarchitectural enhancements to a modern microprocessor implementation based on the PowerPC 620 that enable value prediction can effectively exploit value locality to collapse true dependences, reduce average result latency and provide performance gains of 4.5%-23% (depending on machine model) by exceeding the dataflow limit.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Registers","Parallel processing","Strain control","Computer aided instruction","Microarchitecture","Pipelines","Arithmetic","Modems","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets","parallel architectures","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dataflow limit","value prediction","serialization constraints","program semantics","value locality","microarchitectural enhancements","storage location","machine instructions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566464","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1996.566464","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture.

The first method dependence speculation, is used to eliminate address generation-load dependences. This is enabled by address prediction that permits load instructions to proceed speculatively without waiting for their address operands. The second technique, dependence collapsing, is used to eliminate data dependences by combining a dependence among multiple instructions into one instruction. The potential of these techniques for improving processor performance is demonstrated via trace-driven simulation. When both techniques are used with maximum issue widths of 4, 8, 16, and 32, the overall speedups in comparison to a base instruction level parallel machine are 1.20, 1.35, 1.51, and 1.66, respectively. In general, dependence collapsing contributes the majority of the improvement in performance. Under the dependence collapsing model, 298 to 478 of the total number of instructions in a trace may be collapsed. The distance separating the collapsed instructions is nearly always less than 8. Our experimentation also suggests that further performance improvements can be achieved by incorporating mechanisms that increase the address prediction rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance potential of data dependence speculation and collapsing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture.

High level loop transformations such as fission, fusion, tiling, interchanging and outer loop unrolling (e.g., unroll and jam) are well known to be capable of improving all these aspects of performance. Difficulties arise because these machine characteristics and these optimizations are highly interdependent. Interchanging two loops might, for example, improve cache behavior but make it impossible to allocate registers in the inner loop. Similarly, unrolling or interchanging a loop might individually hurt performance but doing both simultaneously might help performance. Little work has been published on how to combine these transformations into an efficient and effective compiler algorithm. In this paper we present a model that estimates total machine cycle time taking into account cache misses, software pipelining, register pressure and loop overhead. We then develop an algorithm to intelligently search through the various possible transformations, using our machine model to select the set of transformations leading to the best overall performance. We have implemented this algorithm as part of the MIPSPro commercial compiler system. We give experimental results showing that our approach is both effective and efficient in optimizing numerical programs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining loop transformations considering caches and scheduling","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture.

The system uses a product-quality compiler that generates very aggressive VLIW code. We retarget the compiler until we have found a VLIW architecture idealized for the application on the basis of performance, a cost function and a hardware budget. We show that we can automatically select architectures that achieve large speedups on color and image processing codes. Specialization is shown to be very valuable: The differences between architectural choices, even among reasonable-seeming architectures having similar costs, can be very great, often a factor of 5 (and sometimes much more). We show also that specialization is also very dangerous. A reasonable choice of architecture to fit one algorithm can be a very poor choice for another even in the same domain. There is sometimes an architecture, near in cost and performance to the best, that does much better on a second algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566472/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5485010","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Custom-fit processors: letting applications define architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Custom-fit processors: letting applications define architectures","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00566472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041624S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4226","citationCount":"36","articleId":"566472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":566476,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Jincheng","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Jincheng","id":"37266213600"},{"name":"Yang Baozong","lastName":"Yang Baozong","id":"37086996545"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2912-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"566476","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet domain","Decorrelation","Fourier transforms","Wavelet analysis","Quantization","Data visualization","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","rendering (computer graphics)","transform coding","wavelet transforms","tree data structures","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volume rendering","3D image compression","wavelet transform","efficient classified quantization","bit allocation strategy","zero-tree structure","zero coefficients"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a 3D image compression method which is volume rendering oriented and uses wavelet transforms.

CNNs are well known for their image processing capabilities, specially for grey-scale medical images and images of a natural scene. In many applications it would be very useful if the operation of a template or a complex analogic algorithm were highly illumination independent.

The first class includes autonomous oscillatory neural networks while the second includes chaotic synchronizing CNNs. Allowing interconnection weights to adapt during the state evolution of such systems, higher degree of order is achieved for both classes of systems, and based on this observations we introduce a conjecture regarding the relationship between system entropy and self-organization. This result seems to have a universality characteristic. Within the CNN's framework, the above mentioned phenomena may be exploited as new classes of computational behaviors. Some applications are suggested including image processing, template design, pattern formation and intelligent chaotic synchronization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566505/","accessionNumber":"5507972","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Getting order in chaotic cellular neural networks by self-organization with Hebbian adaptation rules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Getting order in chaotic cellular neural networks by self-organization with Hebbian adaptation rules","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"00566505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038245S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"12314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279","articleId":"566505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":566507,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These algorithms can usually be implemented on parallel computing structures. CNN is a fast parallel processor array for image processing. However, CNN is basically a deterministic analog circuit. We use the CNN-UM architecture for statistical image segmentation. With a single random in-put signal, we were able to implement a (pseudo) random field generator using one layer (one memory/cell) of the CNN. The whole algorithm needs 8 memories/cell. We can introduce this pseudo-stochastic segmentation process in the CNN structure. Considering the simple structure of the analog VLSI design, we use simple arithmetic functions (addition, multiplication) and very simple nonlinear output functions (step, jigsaw). With this architecture, a real VLSI CNN chip can execute a pseudo-stochastic relaxation algorithm of about 100 iterations in about 1 msec. In the Markov random field (MRF) theory, one important problem is parameter estimation. The random segmentation process must be preceded by the estimation of the gray-level distribution of the different classes on small image segments. This process is basically supervised. Usually the histograms of noisy images can be modelled as simple Gaussian distributions. This approach cannot be held in a CNN structure, since there should be as many additional layers as the number of classes. We should follow another way. We have developed a pixel-level distribution model.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1996.566509","pdfPath":"/iel3/4279/12314/00566509.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","publicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1996.566509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular neural network for Markov random field image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Cellular neural network for Markov random field image segmentation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5507976","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular neural network for Markov random field image segmentation","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"00566509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056181S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"12314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279","citationCount":"2","articleId":"566509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":566512,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Therefore, there have been several attempts to introduce cell circuits suitable for large-scale integration. Up to now, all of these cells need energy and therefore power supply. Recently attempts have been made to build up circuitry able to work without an external energy supply by using the energy stored in the initial state. This principle can provide two major advantages. First, since no or at least not much energy is dissipated during computation, the circuit does not produce much heat. Therefore, there are no \"hot spots\" in integrated circuits, which limit integration density and operation speed. Furthermore, since there is no need for a power supply, the absence of voltage supply lines supports a high integration density. In this work an architecture for the realisation of a lossless CNN is proposed. Further, since standard learning algorithms turn out to fail for lossless systems, a way to amend these is introduced.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1996.566515","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4279/12314/00566515.pdf","publicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1996.566515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless cellular neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Differential equations","Electronic mail","Power supplies","Coupling circuits","Jacobian matrices","Circuit synthesis","Image processing","Circuit simulation","Large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","neural chips","backpropagation","recurrent neural nets","large scale integration","neural net architecture","nonlinear network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossless cellular neural networks","cell circuits","large-scale integration","high integration density","recurrent backpropagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Lossless cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","accessionNumber":"5507981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"00566515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.18869S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"12314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279","articleId":"566515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":566516,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Conventional neurobiological method study single cells, and activity is recorded in response to simple stimuli as a function of time. By modeling retina activity using cellular neural network (CNN) one can begin to think about retinal interactions in space/time, and consider the activity of large populations of cells as the deformation of surfaces. Using CNN we predicted a powerful form of edge enhancement mediated by a novel space-time interaction. This is the first known form of edge enhancement that is not mediated by lateral inhibition.

In almost any analogic CNN algorithm that performs an image processing task, binary CNNs play an important role. We observed that all binary CNNs reported in the literature, except for a connected component detector, exhibit monotonic dynamics. In the paper we show that the local stability of a monotonic binary CNN represents sufficient condition for its functionality, i.e. convergence of all initial states to the prescribed global stable equilibria. Based on this finding, we propose a rigorous design method, which results in a set of design constraints in a form of linear equalities. These are obtained from a simple local rules similar to that in elementary cellular automata without having to worry about continuous dynamics of a CNN. In the end we utilize our method to design a new CNN template for detecting holes in a 2D object.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1996.566593","startPage":"321","endPage":"326","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4279/12314/00566593.pdf","publicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1996.566593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of monotonic binary-valued cellular neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis","Detectors","Neural networks","Image processing","Stability","Sufficient conditions","Convergence","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monotonic binary-valued cellular neural network design","learning techniques","image processing","monotonic dynamics","local stability","CNN","functionality","convergence","linear equalities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Design of monotonic binary-valued cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","accessionNumber":"5508007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of monotonic binary-valued cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"00566593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051214S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"12314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279","citationCount":"7","articleId":"566593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":566594,"authors":[{"name":"M.-D.

The system consists of three processing units: i) transformation of a 1-dimensional (1-D) signal into a sequence of 2-dimensional (2-D) signals, so called images obtained by a low pass filter cascade incorporated with a grid like correlation process ii) concentrating an image sequence into a single image by a linear threshold template CNN, iii) classification of the resulting image by discrete-valued perceptrons. In this paper, a discrete WT incorporating a grid like correlation process has been used for transforming a 1-D acoustic signal into an image sequence. All other operations needed for the classification has been performed for the sake of comparison. The WT based technique proposed in this paper gives the possibility of acoustic alarm signal classification by using CNNs of small size, e.g., 13/spl times/13.

A 3/spl times/3 CNN IC test prototype was designed and fabricated for this purpose. The study considers both the manufacturability and computing performance power of hypothetical large CNN arrays. The manufacturability analysis has been geared towards IC yield prediction using our actual IC layout along with some realistic parameters representing the \"cleanliness\" of the manufacturing line. Additionally, from experimental results we have found that offset effects are dominant and if they are not properly canceled they can produce incorrect processing results. As a one-on-one mapping between image pixels and CNN cells is practically impossible, the computing performance analysis concentrates on the optimal array size needed to efficiently implement a multiplexing scheme versus the hypothetical fully parallel CNN architecture. Our results indicate that a 50/spl times/50 array is feasible for a time multiplexing scheme. This array will consume around 4 W. The predicted yield of such array is about 70%. The implementation cost is around 30% of a 100/spl times/100 array, or alternatively only 2% of a 200/spl times/200 array, and only 0.04% slower than a hypothetical fully parallel processing architecture.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1996.566605","publicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications Proceedings (CNNA-96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4279/12314/00566605.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1996.566605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal manufacturable CNN array size for time multiplexing schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566605/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal manufacturable CNN array size for time multiplexing schemes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","accessionNumber":"5508018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal manufacturable CNN array size for time multiplexing schemes","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"00566605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052552S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"12314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279","articleId":"566605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566606,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The approach, time-multiplexing, is prompted by the need to simulate hardware models and test hardware implementations of CNN. For practical size applications, due to hardware limitations, it is impossible to have a one-on-one mapping between the CNN hardware processors and all the pixels in the image involved. This paper presents a practical solution by processing the input image block by block, with the number of pixels in a block being the same as the number of CNN processors in the hardware.

The object is assumed to be an infinite cylinder of known cross section illuminated by a TM plane wave and the scattered field is measured on a line segment perpendicular to the direction of incidence. Measurement data are carried out at three different frequencies for a homogeneous cylinder of known dielectric constant. The location and contour shape are determined using two different reconstruction algorithms, a Newton-Kantorovich (NK) method and the modified gradient (MG) method whose effectiveness and robustness are compared. Both methods are based on domain integral representations of the field in the body. They involve an iterative minimization of the defect between an integral representation of the field measured on the line and the actual measured data. The NK method involves a linearization of the nonlinear relation between the field and the contrast, as well as the solution of a direct scattering problem at each iteration. The MG method seeks the simultaneous reconstruction of the field and the characteristic function of the support of the scatterer without solving a direct problem at each step. Both methods employed the same initial guess and the a priori information that the characteristic function is nonnegative.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave imaging-Location and shape reconstruction from multifrequency scattering data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.566625","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel4/22/12320/00566625.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.566625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Microwave imaging-Location and shape reconstruction from multifrequency scattering data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5561864","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave imaging-Location and shape reconstruction from multifrequency scattering data","sourcePdf":"00566625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055985S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"112","articleId":"566625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566629,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Wen Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Jin-Wen College of Business and Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Wen Chiu","id":"37365136900"},{"name":"Ruey-Beei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ruey-Beei Wu","id":"37279512600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"566629","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","Coplanar waveguides","Metallization","Equations","Finite element methods","Finite difference methods","Waveguide discontinuities","Transmission line discontinuities","Microstrip","MMICs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coplanar waveguides","waveguide discontinuities","capacitance","metallisation","waveguide theory","finite element analysis","variational techniques","perturbation techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance computation","CPW discontinuities","finite metallization thickness","hybrid finite-element method","variational equation","coplanar waveguide structures","static potential","slot region","perturbation formula","equivalent capacitances","hybrid FEM"]}],"abstract":"A variational equation is derived for the capacitances of coplanar waveguide (CPW) structures with finite metallization thickness. The equation is expressed in terms of the static potential in the slot region and is solved by applying the hybrid finite-element method (FEM). In the case of small metallization thickness, it is reduced to a perturbation formula for the incremental capacitances. Numerical results for the equivalent capacitances of various discontinuities with finite metallization thickness are presented and compared with measured data. The reasonable agreement between the measured data and the theoretical results validates the present approach. Being simple and computationally efficient, the method is suitable for dealing with extensive CPW discontinuity problems where the metallization thickness is not negligible.","doi":"10.1109/22.566629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel4/22/12320/00566629.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.566629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12320","startPage":"498","endPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitance computation for CPW discontinuities with finite metallization thickness by hybrid finite-element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacitance computation for CPW discontinuities with finite metallization thickness by hybrid finite-element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5561868","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitance computation for CPW discontinuities with finite metallization thickness by hybrid finite-element method","sourcePdf":"00566629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038941S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"13","articleId":"566629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566633,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This model is used in the analysis of the performance of a C-class amplifier at 4 GHz over a -50/spl deg/ to 100/spl deg/C temperature range and for different bias conditions. The dependencies of the elements of the equivalent circuit, as well as the amplifier gain on the temperature and the operating point, are evaluated. The gain optimization and the analysis as a function of temperature of the MESFET amplifier are done by using the describing function technique. Optimum bias device conditions in the C-class are obtained for maximum gain and also the flattest gain versus input power rate. A comparison between theoretical and measured results over temperature and bias ranges is shown. Experimental results show an excellent agreement with the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5561872","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the bias and temperature dependence of a C-class MESFET amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the bias and temperature dependence of a C-class MESFET amplifier","sourcePdf":"00566633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030708S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"3","articleId":"566633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":566647,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Joo Maeng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung Joo Maeng","id":"37659924300"},{"name":"Il-Taek Lim","affiliation":["Gold Star Central Research Laboratory, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Il-Taek Lim","id":"37345226200"},{"name":"Byeong Gi Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeong Gi Lee","id":"37281113300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"566647","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transfer functions","Riccati equations","Polynomials","Matrix converters","Digital systems","Stability","Digital arithmetic","Limit-cycles","Finite wordlength effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","transfer functions","cascade systems","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LBR realization","lossless bounded real realization","multi-input multi-output systems","two-pair cascades","systematic extraction procedure","HR transfer function","TDF transfer matrix","rotation blocks"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a lossless bounded real (LBR) realization method of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems using rotation blocks.

In this paper we analyze the performance of both p-i-n and optical preamplifier receivers for spectrum-sliced WDM using actual noise distributions, and the results are compared with those using the Gaussian approximation. This extends prior results of Marcuse for the detection of deterministic signals in the presence of optical amplifier and receiver noise. Although the methodology is similar, the results are considerably different when the signal is itself noise-like. For the case of noise-like signals, it is shown that when an optical preamplifier receiver is used, there exists an optimum filter bandwidth which minimizes the detection sensitivity for a given error probability. Moreover the evaluated detection sensitivity, in photons/bit, represents an order of magnitude (>10 dB) improvement over conventional detection techniques that employ p-i-n receivers. The Gaussian approximation is shown to be overly conservative when dealing with small ratios of the receiver optical to electrical bandwidth, for both p-i-n and preamplifier receivers.","doi":"10.1109/50.566678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.566678","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/12323/00566678.pdf","startPage":"576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical preamplifier receiver for spectrum-sliced WDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566678/","displayDocTitle":"Optical preamplifier receiver for spectrum-sliced WDM","volume":"15","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5561368","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical preamplifier receiver for spectrum-sliced WDM","sourcePdf":"00566678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069371S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"23","articleId":"566678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":566689,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper we present techniques for compression of laser line scan and camera images, as well as format-specific data compression for quick-look sonar mapping data. For image compression JPEG and a wavelet-based technique (EPIC) are examined. JPEG is found to be less efficient than the wavelet transform but has the advantage that it is robust with respect to lost data packets. The wavelet-based transform is more efficient at high compression rates though below a certain rate both offer similar performance. The specific context for this work is the autonomous minehunting and mapping technology (AMMT) demonstration which utilizes the DARPA large diameter underwater vehicle. The ultimate goal of the project is identification and imaging of mine-like objects. The algorithms presented here were implemented in real-time and operated in the field for this program.

The methodology combines the use of a heat transfer solver for the prediction of the temperature distribution among the electronic components and a genetic algorithm for the adaptive search of optimal or near optimal solutions and a multiobjective optimization strategy (Pareto optimization and Multiattribute utility analysis). After proper validation of the elements of the solution methodology (heat transfer solver/genetic algorithm) in isolation, the methodology under consideration is tested using a placement problem (case study) that considers as optimization criteria the minimization of an estimate of the failure rate of the system of components due to thermal overheating (via an Arrhenius relation) and the minimization of the total wiring length (given some interconnectivity requirements). Results corresponding to the case study are presented and discussed for both Pareto optimization and Multiattribute utility analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566786/","accessionNumber":"5591284","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization of component placement on planar printed wiring boards","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization of component placement on planar printed wiring boards","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00566786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040466S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan 1997","isNumber":"12329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284","citationCount":"2","articleId":"566786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":566797,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Pairwise data clustering is a combinatorial optimization method for data grouping which extracts hidden structure from proximity data. We describe a deterministic annealing approach to pairwise clustering which shares the robustness properties of maximum entropy inference. The resulting Gibbs probability distributions are estimated by mean-field approximation. A new structure-preserving algorithm to cluster dissimilarity data and to simultaneously embed these data in a Euclidian vector space is discussed which can be used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. The suggested embedding algorithm which outperforms conventional approaches has been implemented to analyze dissimilarity data from protein analysis and from linguistics.

Minutiae are essentially terminations and bifurcations of the ridge lines that constitute a fingerprint pattern. Automatic minutiae detection is an extremely critical process, especially in low-quality fingerprints where noise and contrast deficiency can originate pixel configurations similar to minutiae or hide real minutiae. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature; although rather different from each other, all these methods transform fingerprint images into binary images. In this work we propose an original technique, based on ridge line following, where the minutiae are extracted directly from gray scale images. The results achieved are compared with those obtained through some methods based on image binarization. In spite of a greater conceptual complexity, the method proposed performs better both in terms of efficiency and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/34.566808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"27","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/12296/00566808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.566808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct gray-scale minutiae detection in fingerprints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Fingerprint recognition","Bifurcation","Pixel","Image matching","Optical noise","Biomedical optical imaging","Robustness","Feature extraction","Biometrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","image matching","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct gray-scale minutiae detection","fingerprint comparison","minutiae matching","terminations","bifurcations","noise","contrast deficiency","pixel configurations","binary images","ridge line following","image binarization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","displayDocTitle":"Direct gray-scale minutiae detection in fingerprints","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5493196","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566808/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct gray-scale minutiae detection in fingerprints","sourcePdf":"00566808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040145S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"387","articleId":"566808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566809,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We formulate a new approach for establishing invariant features. Our approach is unique in the field since it considers not just surface reflection and surface geometry in the specification of invariant features, but it also takes into account internal object composition and state which affect images sensed in the nonvisible spectrum. A new type of invariance called thermophysical invariance is defined. Features are defined such that they are functions of only the thermophysical properties of the imaged objects. The approach is based on a physics-based model that is derived from the principle of the conservation of energy applied at the surface of the imaged object.","doi":"10.1109/34.566809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/12296/00566809.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.566809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermophysical algebraic invariants from infrared imagery for object recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566809/","displayDocTitle":"Thermophysical algebraic invariants from infrared imagery for object recognition","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5493197","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermophysical algebraic invariants from infrared imagery for object recognition","sourcePdf":"00566809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040257S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"10","articleId":"566809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":566819,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is characterized by the intensive use of the most advanced digital modulation formats (8VSB, QAM, OFDM) in combination with high power RF amplifiers. To date the linearity required for these digital formats has only been accomplished in cumbersome low efficiency class A amplifier or even more cumbersome feed-forward systems. A potentially more efficient and cost effective approach is the combination of nonlinear power amplifiers and a predistortion technique capable of compensating for the nonlinear amplifiers. Digital predistortion will provide a highly linear output and improved efficiency. Itelco has developed a digital adaptive base band predistorter to provide for improved performance and cost. The technique is independent of the modulation type, the output frequency, or the signal bandwidth. Furthermore the capability of automatic adaptive predistortion to compensate for the environment (temperature, power supply variations, aging, and even operation during replacement of a faulty module) is highly desirable.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/12301/00566819.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/11.566819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.566819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital linearizer for RF amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency amplifiers","Predistortion","Costs","Power amplifiers","Broadcast technology","Digital modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","OFDM","Linearity","Feedforward systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital audio broadcasting","digital television","linearisation techniques","radiofrequency amplifiers","power amplifiers","electric distortion","adaptive systems","quadrature amplitude modulation","frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM","digital linearizer","broadcast technology","digital modulation formats","8VSB","nonlinear power amplifiers","OFDM","high power RF amplifiers","predistortion technique","digital predistortion","Itelco","linear output","efficiency","digital adaptive baseband predistorter","performance","cost","output frequency","signal bandwidth","automatic adaptive predistortion","temperature compensation","power supply variations","aging","digital video broadcasting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Digital linearizer for RF amplifiers","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5515891","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital linearizer for RF amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00566819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028495S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"30","articleId":"566819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":566826,"authors":[{"name":"L.

COFDM is a channel coding and modulation scheme which mitigates the adverse effects of fading by using wideband multicarrier modulation combined with time interleaving and a convolutional error correcting code. A guard interval is inserted at the transition between successive symbols to absorb the intersymbol interference created by the time domain spread of the mobile radio channel. The decoding process is performed using differential demodulation in conjunction with a soft decision Viterbi decoder. The COFDM evaluation is done by means of computer simulations. A parametric study of the proposed COFDM system is done in this first of a series of papers to determine the optimal system parameter values for operation at a radio frequency of 1.5 GHz. The results show that the parameter values proposed in the standard are indeed well suited for operation at 1.5 GHz. Using the set of optimal parameter values found, the COFDM performance is then evaluated in mobile radio channels typical of different geographical environments. Simulation results confirm the benefit that the system gains from frequency diversity found in the urban and hilly terrain areas.","doi":"10.1109/11.566826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/12301/00566826.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.566826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of COFDM for digital audio broadcasting.

However, understanding the organizational context and rationales (the \"Whys\") that lead up to systems requirements can be just as important for the ongoing success of the system. Requirements modelling techniques can be used to help deal with the knowledge and reasoning needed in this earlier phase of requirements engineering. However most existing requirements techniques are intended more for the later phase of requirements engineering, which focuses on completeness, consistency, and automated verification of requirements. In contrast, the early phase aims to model and analyze stakeholder interests and how they might be addressed, or compromised, by various system-and-environment alternatives. This paper argues, therefore, that a different kind of modelling and reasoning support is needed for the early phase. An outline of the i* framework is given as an example of a step in this direction. Meeting scheduling is used as a domain example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Jan 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5496533","conferenceDate":"6-10 Jan. 1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Towards modelling and reasoning support for early-phase requirements engineering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards modelling and reasoning support for early-phase requirements engineering","confLoc":"Annapolis, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00566873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068855S","chronDate":"6-10 Jan 1997","isNumber":"12313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278","citationCount":"575","articleId":"566873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":566907,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Also in this article, a new compression algorithm is introduced, based on analysis by synthesis coding. In our compression system the encoder consists of a long term and a short term predictors and a quantizer with an adaptive number and values of levels, which are depended on the definition of maximum permitted distortion for each segment in the signal. The algorithm exhibits better results than other known compression algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 19th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel3/4282/12326/00566907.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 19th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEIS.1996.566907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEIS.1996.566907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=566907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A diagnostic meaningful distortion measure for ECG compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion measurement","Electrocardiography","Shape measurement","Compression algorithms","Patient monitoring","Information rates","Weight measurement","Solid state circuits","Mean square error methods","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","data compression","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic meaningful distortion measure","ECG signal compression","diagnostic distortion measure","weighted diagnostic distortion","P wave duration","P wave amplitude","P wave shape","QT duration","ST elevation","original ECG signal","reconstructed ECG signal","synthesis coding","short term predictor","quantizer","long term predictor","maximum permitted distortion","signal segment","compression algorithm","electrodiagnostics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"A diagnostic meaningful distortion measure for ECG compression","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5622094","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-6 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A diagnostic meaningful distortion measure for ECG compression","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"00566907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028314S","chronDate":"5-6 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282","citationCount":"9","articleId":"566907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":566912,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The coefficients of the FIR PPFs can be analytically derived, but the use of these structures is limited by their high passband gain-peak and modest stopband attenuation. It has been shown that by introducing feedback terms to the basic FIR structure, these shortcomings can be effectively remedied. Previously, no well-developed method has existed for the choice of the feedback coefficients, however. We present a method for optimizing the feedback coefficients of the IIR PPFs based on an arbitrary desired (lowpass) magnitude response provided by the user. Simple genetic algorithm is employed in the optimization because of its ability to effectively solve even highly nonlinear problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/566974/","accessionNumber":"5636916","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of polynomial predictive IIR filters using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of polynomial predictive IIR filters using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00566974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03943S","chronDate":"14-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4274","citationCount":"3","articleId":"566974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":566980,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxia Zou","affiliation":["Electronics and Information Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Xiaoxia Zou","id":"37087905819"},{"name":"S.

A systematic study of 1/f noise in CMOS transistors is reported under various bias conditions ranging from subthreshold to strong saturation regions of operation. In the present study, in the saturation region, the range of gate and drain bias voltages is limited to values where the decrease in surface mobility is very small and practically negligible. The voltage range corresponding to this assumption is obtained from the measured transconductance. A useful model for analog designers is presented for such large area transistors with a practically constant surface mobility. The measured input-referred noise in strong inversion of such transistors is well modeled with S/sub VG/=M/(C/sub ox//sup 2/ZLf/sup /spl beta//) where M is a process dependent empirical constant, as verified by measurements. The measured values of M for several n-mos and p-mos transistors with different areas and process runs (but exposed to the same \"low noise process\") vary, respectively, between 4/spl plusmn/2 10/sup -31/ Cb/cm/sup 2/ and 2/spl plusmn/1 10/sup -32/ Cb/cm/sup 2/. Below threshold voltage, a significant reduction is observed in the input-referred noise as gate voltage is decreased, corresponding to the prediction of the model and due to the exponential reduction of the inversion capacitance with gate voltage. This behavior is observed for both n-mos and p-mos transistors. From the measurements and modeling it is concluded that to reduce 1/f noise in analog applications it is recommended to design the largest area transistor in the available chip area, to rely on p-channel transistors and to operate in subthreshold. If operation in saturation is required, it is advised to limit the bias voltages to values corresponding to a constant mobility since in p-mos transistors M increases with higher gate voltages.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEIS.1996.567039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12326","startPage":"557","endPage":"560","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 19th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel3/4282/12326/00567039.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1/f noise in CMOS transistors for analog applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"1/f noise in CMOS transistors for analog applications","conferenceDate":"5-6 Nov. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5622194","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1/f noise in CMOS transistors for analog applications","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"00567039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037491S","chronDate":"5-6 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282","citationCount":"4","articleId":"567039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":567049,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Zhijin","affiliation":["Hangzhou Institute of Electronics Engineering, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Zhijin","id":"37643223600"},{"name":"Qian Huisheng","affiliation":["Hangzhou Institute of Electronics Engineering, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qian Huisheng","id":"37845753000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2912-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"567049","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Sliding mode control","Tiles","AC generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","computational complexity","numerical stability","signal processing","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transform","recursive algorithms","digital signal processing","regular structure","DCT-II","multiplication coefficients","DCT-I","DCT-IV","algorithm complexity","stability"]}],"abstract":"The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is one of the most widely used transforms in digital signal processing.

The control is based on flux feedback with a flux simulator. Since the simulator is based on a rotor current model, it is independent of the primary resistance, but uses the magnetizing inductance and secondary time constant values to estimate the flux. Parameter mismatch in the simulator detrimentally affects flux and torque responses. In order to compensate for degradation of the responses, an identifier for the magnetizing inductance and the secondary time constant is introduced. The identifier is insensitive to the primary resistance because it is based on instantaneous reactive power of the motor. Also, a leakage inductance identifier is introduced to achieve perfect compensation, which is robust against other parameters owing to instantaneous harmonic reactive power. To verify feasibility of the proposed technique, digital simulations and experimental tests have been conducted. The results have proven excellent characteristics of the drive system, which confirms validity of the scheme.","doi":"10.1109/28.567074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"35","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/12303/00567074.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.567074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field-oriented control of an induction motor with robust on-line tuning of its parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Robust control","Inductance","Magnetic flux","Reactive power","Torque control","Feedback","Rotors","Degradation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine control","torque control","parameter estimation","compensation","robust control","inductance","magnetic flux","magnetisation","electric resistance","feedback","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor","robust on-line tuning","field-oriented control","torque control","robust control","leakage inductance","magnetizing inductance","secondary time constant","flux feedback","flux simulator","rotor current model","primary resistance","flux estimation","parameter mismatch","torque response compensation","drive system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Field-oriented control of an induction motor with robust on-line tuning of its parameters","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5504169","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567074/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field-oriented control of an induction motor with robust on-line tuning of its parameters","sourcePdf":"00567074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085051S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","isNumber":"12303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"78","articleId":"567074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":567075,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Mok Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jang-Mok Kim","id":"37087177146"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37086965531"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"567075","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":296,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":4713},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567075","abstract":"A novel flux-weakening scheme for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) is proposed.

When lamp power is below 50 W these lamps cannot be connected to power line directly because a low input voltage, between 6 and 24 V, is needed. Traditional supply equipments for low-power halogen lamps are 50/60-Hz transformers, but they are bulky and heavy. A low-cost, reliable, high-frequency supply system (an electronic transformer) for low-power halogen cycle lamps, based on a self-oscillating half-bridge inverter, is described in this paper. Compared with a 50-Hz transformer, weight and size have been minimized. Moreover, a high power factor, more than 0.9, has been achieved, and the circuit is reliable and flexible.","doi":"10.1109/28.567124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.567124","startPage":"246","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/12303/00567124.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved electronic transformer for low-power halogen cycle lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"An improved electronic transformer for low-power halogen cycle lamps","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5510079","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567124/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved electronic transformer for low-power halogen cycle lamps","sourcePdf":"00567124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028641S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","isNumber":"12303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"5","articleId":"567124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":567217,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For a nine-tone test (with uniformly distributed random phase), a fifth order predistorter, if properly adapted will give an IMD improvement of between 8.5 dB and 40 dB from the worst IMD level, provided by the raw nonlinear amplifier.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567396","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12327/00567396.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"271 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predistort-linearisation method for future basestation amplifiers of cellular radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Predistort-linearisation method for future basestation amplifiers of cellular radio","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657947","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567396/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predistort-linearisation method for future basestation amplifiers of cellular radio","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023265S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","articleId":"567396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":567401,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

This bound is first evaluated over time-varying frequency-selective fading channels by treating this information theoretic value of the capacity as a random variable. The total system sum-of-rates capacity is then evaluated for both multiple-access schemes using a multi-cell simulator and the 99% reliability level of the radio link capacity. System capacity is compared as a function of the number of cells per cluster and the use of power control in the FD-TDMA system, the spreading gain in the CDMA system, the receiver space diversity level, the number of channel multipath components as well as large-scale propagation parameters such as the shadowing standard deviation and the path-loss exponent. According to this methodology, it is observed that CDMA system capacity can be but is not always superior to FD-TDMA capacity. The spectral efficiency advantage (in terms of capacity per unit bandwidth) of CDMA over FD-TDMA systems is however much larger for larger spreading gains.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567422","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12327/00567422.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"391 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative evaluation of CDMA and FD-TDMA cellular system capacities with respect to radio link capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567422/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative evaluation of CDMA and FD-TDMA cellular system capacities with respect to radio link capacity","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657972","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative evaluation of CDMA and FD-TDMA cellular system capacities with respect to radio link capacity","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033921S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"1","articleId":"567422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":567423,"authors":[{"name":"G.

As the throughput performance of such a scheme becomes critical when the number of mobile stations increases, in this paper we propose an adaptive contention window mechanism, which dynamically selects the optimal backoff window according to the estimate of the number of contending stations. We show that this technique leads to stable behavior, and it outperforms the standard protocol when the network load and the number of mobile stations are high. We also investigate the CSMA/CA with the optional RTS/CTS technique, and we show that our adaptive technique reaches better performance only when the packet size is short.

Four different channel conditions were considered: good urban, bad urban, light shadowed rural and medium shadowed rural state. To get the insight of the performance of the code tracking algorithm the mean and standard deviation values of steady state code tracking errors were calculated. Also the convergence time of the recovered code phase from initial code phase error of 0.5 chips was calculated.

The emphasis in this paper is on the jitter and error performance of QPR-TCM and neural network equivalent models in the fading environment with ideal channel state information (CSI) and no side information exist on the phase noise process. Analytical upper bounds are derived using Chernoff bounding technique, combined with the modified generating functional approach. One interesting result is that the bit error probability upper bounds of the proposed scheme is better than 4QAM-TCM for SNR values greater than a threshold, which have the best error performance till now. Neural network models of QPR-TCM schemes are introduced for the first time in the literature for fading channels and the bit error event curves are derived using the back propagation algorithm. It is shown that neuro-computing results confirm the analytical approach.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567436","startPage":"457","endPage":"461 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12327/00567436.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jitter and error performance analysis of QPR-TCM and neural network equivalent systems over mobile satellite channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Performance analysis","Neural networks","Fading","Upper bound","Bandwidth","Partial response signaling","Modulation coding","Channel state information","Phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis coded modulation","jitter","partial response channels","telecommunication signalling","telecommunication computing","error statistics","backpropagation","neural nets","fading","Rayleigh channels","phase noise","mobile satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","error performance analysis","QPR-TCM","neural network equivalent systems","mobile satellite channels","bandwidth efficiency","partial response signaling","trellis coded modulation","fading environment","ideal channel state information","upper bounds","Chernoff bounding technique","modified generating functional approach","bit error probability upper bounds","SNR values","neural network models","fading channels","bit error event curves","back propagation algorithm","neuro-computing results","Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Jitter and error performance analysis of QPR-TCM and neural network equivalent systems over mobile satellite channels","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5657986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jitter and error performance analysis of QPR-TCM and neural network equivalent systems over mobile satellite channels","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035804S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","articleId":"567436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":567437,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The performance results are presented in terms of the AFC loop acquisition time, the rms frequency error and the rms phase error. The results indicate that a two-step frequency acquisition strategy is useful to reach a good compromise between short acquisition time and low rms frequency error. The worst-case acquisition times of the AFC loop were achieved at low elevations, being below 297 ms at signal-to-noise ratios of 9 dB or higher.

It is a difficult task to analytically compute the average bit error probability of multiuser DS-CDMA systems. In this paper we aim to use bounds to accurately evaluate the optimal performance of a multiuser DS-CDMA system, both synchronous and asynchronous. We present a general algorithm to compute the partial distance spectrum of the multiuser system. Numerical results for both systems with binary random signature waveforms of length 31 are used to illustrate the method. It has been found that the optimal bounds for the asynchronous system have a lower bit error probability (BEP) than synchronous systems. Focus is given to two areas namely 1) computing bit error probability (BEP) given a particular correlation matrix, 2) applying optimal conditional importance sampling and computing bit error probability for randomly generated correlation matrices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounds for optimum multiuser DS-CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567455","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12327/00567455.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"554 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Bounds for optimum multiuser DS-CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5658005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds for optimum multiuser DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035184S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","articleId":"567455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":567456,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We further investigate the performance of the successive IC scheme subject to the delay constraint, which may be imposed typically on most speech and video applications. It has been shown that the successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme is more resistant to fading than the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) scheme.

Such receivers have the potential to dramatically increase capacity of CDMA systems compared to systems with conventional correlator receivers, without the high complexity associated with many proposed multi-user receivers. To be practical for many applications, the convergence rate of the adaptive algorithms must be improved, while maintaining low residual mean-squared error (MSE), robustness to noise and realisable complexity. The slow convergence of the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm is highlighted for this application. Recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms are shown to give much quicker convergence, but have much higher sensitivity to thermal noise. Algorithms normally termed \"Fast-RLS\", are shown to more complex than the conventional RLS algorithm when used in a CDMA receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12327/00567462.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"587 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive algorithms for asynchronous DS-CDMA receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive algorithm","Multiaccess communication","Least squares approximation","Convergence","Additive white noise","Noise robustness","Gaussian noise","Resonance light scattering","Channel capacity","Australia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","radio receivers","least mean squares methods","convergence of numerical methods","adaptive signal detection","channel capacity","computational complexity","adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive algorithms","asynchronous DS-CDMA receivers","minimum mean square error","direct sequence code division multiple access","convergence rate","least mean squares algorithm","LMS algorithm","recursive least squares algorithms","RLS algorithms","thermal noise sensitivity","MMSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive algorithms for asynchronous DS-CDMA receivers","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5658011","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive algorithms for asynchronous DS-CDMA receivers","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039283S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"4","articleId":"567462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":567463,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Wei Huang","id":"37345823200"},{"name":"V.K.

The impacts of power level and power control error on the capacity, throughput and delay are analyzed. It is shown that system performance can be improved by selecting appropriate power levels for different services and having a tight power control, especially on voice calls. When the source rate of a data call is twice as high as that of a voice call, two schemes of transmitting data are compared.

Using these results, the network throughput figures of finite user DS/CDMA-ALOHA are presented for various spatial node distributions. Fairness in terms of equal share for all nodes on the network throughput is not always given.

Although the positional inhomogeneity of structure types gives rise to some variation from one measured position to another, these positional variabilities are not large, The overall trend of reflection coefficients calculated by multi-layer dielectric models thus mainly agrees well with the trend of the measurements. We have shown that the use of circular polarization can reduce the reflection even if the interior parts of the structure have complicated structures. In addition, the shadowing effects of several types of partitions were measured. The transmission coefficients of partitions depend on the materials. The losses due to plywood partitions are very low, but a metallic partition shields millimeter waves.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567504","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567504.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements of reflection and transmission characteristics of interior structures of office building in the 60 GHz band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567504/","displayDocTitle":"Measurements of reflection and transmission characteristics of interior structures of office building in the 60 GHz band","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657428","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements of reflection and transmission characteristics of interior structures of office building in the 60 GHz band","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045017S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"7","articleId":"567504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":567506,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper will investigate the uplink and downlink interference of microcell and macrocell systems under hierarchical conditions. The pilot signal and power control for downlinks are also considered. We use analytical and simulation methods to investigate the problem. However the results are discouraging. The capacity of microcells and macrocells is limited by the downlink and uplink respectively.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567522","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","startPage":"88","endPage":"92 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-channel interference and capacity for two-tier CDMA cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Co-channel interference and capacity for two-tier CDMA cellular systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567522/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657443","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-channel interference and capacity for two-tier CDMA cellular systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02505S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"3","articleId":"567522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":567523,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To overcome these problems, macro-micro cellular systems have been proposed recently. The interference, however, between both cell classes in the macro-micro cellular system is a critical problem, particularly in CDMA systems. This report describes the performance of a CDMA subband system in which the CDMA frequency band is divided into several subbands and both cell classes use the subbands simultaneously. Through evaluations of the uplink simulation, it is found that the characteristics of coverage probability are improved at both the macrocell and microcell by the CDMA frequency band division.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of coverage probability by subband scheme in CDMA macro-micro cellular system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567523","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567523.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"97 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of coverage probability by subband scheme in CDMA macro-micro cellular system","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657444","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of coverage probability by subband scheme in CDMA macro-micro cellular system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023336S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"2","articleId":"567523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":567524,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Liu","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Zhao Liu","id":"37346546100"},{"name":"M.J.

However, the interference model typically used with conventional DS-CDMA cellular systems - a large number of low-power mobiles uniformly distributed in cells - may not hold. In MC-CDMA cellular systems, it is possible for a high-rate mobile, perhaps near the boundary of a cell, to have all the codes for high-rate transmission - therefore transmitting at high power and causing significant interference to the neighboring cell. In this study, we analyze the effects of MC-CDMA intercell interference on the reverse link (i.e., mobile to cell site) and investigate a maximum capacity power allocation (MCPA) criterion that exploits the sub-code concatenation property of MC-CDMA transmission. When the transmission rate is high, power control with MCPA criterion can significantly reduce reverse-link MC-CDMA intercell interference. However, with only four codes per mobile (e.g., as in IS-95), the reduction in intercell interference is less than 1 dB.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567524","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567524.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"102 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference issues in multi-code CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567524/","displayDocTitle":"Interference issues in multi-code CDMA networks","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657445","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference issues in multi-code CDMA networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036373S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"44","articleId":"567524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":567525,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In MCLSP, a hub station continuously senses channel load for a certain number of slots, and computes the probability with which each user station should transmit its packet, then broadcasts the computed value. As the access control is based on this probability, we can apply it to slotted system. We show that MCLSP can achieve significant improvement in throughput performance of CDMA slotted ALOHA systems even in large offered load. One of the issues in such a protocol is the access timing delay, which is the sum of process time and propagation time for the packet access control. We also show the effect of the access timing delay on the throughput performance.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567525","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567525.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","startPage":"103","endPage":"107 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput improvement of CDMA slotted ALOHA system by modified channel load sensing protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Throughput improvement of CDMA slotted ALOHA system by modified channel load sensing protocol","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567525/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657446","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput improvement of CDMA slotted ALOHA system by modified channel load sensing protocol","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076375S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"7","articleId":"567525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":567526,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The channel is assumed Rayleigh and the propagation delay differences between the users are assumed to be a fraction of the symbol time. The receiver employs two structures: a decorrelator structure for channel estimation based on pilot symbols, and a successive interference cancellation scheme (SIC) for data detection. We refer to this receiver as a hybrid receiver and its performance will be compared with that of a pure SIC receiver for both channel estimation and data detection. To facilitate channel estimation in the presence of propagation delay differences, we shortened the correlation interval for the pilot symbols but increased the pilot power accordingly. The numerical results indicate that as far as the bit error rate is concerned, a one-stage hybrid receiver is as good as a two-stage pure SIC receiver. Although the decorrelation receiver has to perform matrix inversions, the matrix updates can be obtained by a computational efficient order recursive procedure. Moreover, the matrix calculations can be spread over a frame, allowing us to keep the computational load per symbol on a moderate level. Therefore, we believe our hybrid receiver scheme offers a good performance at an acceptable level of implementation complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reference symbol assisted interference cancelling hybrid receiver for an asynchronous DS/CDMA system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567526","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567526.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"112 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A reference symbol assisted interference cancelling hybrid receiver for an asynchronous DS/CDMA system","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664569","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reference symbol assisted interference cancelling hybrid receiver for an asynchronous DS/CDMA system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039699S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"2","articleId":"567526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":567527,"authors":[{"name":"X.H.

The system supports service groups with different quality of service (QoS) requirements specified in terms of both transmission bit rate and bit error rate (BER). The optimal received power level for each service group is obtained by minimizing a cost function consisting of the weighted sum of the blocking rates of different service groups subject to their QoS requirements. The performance is compared to a similar system with fixed power assignment (FPA) in which the received power level for each service group is assigned based only on its transmission bit rate. Simulation results show that DPA algorithm can support much higher offered traffic loads, on merit of the blocking probability. By implementing the cost function with different weighting coefficients, we can assign different blocking probabilities to different service groups to cope with the demands in the system. The DPA algorithm therefore plays the role of a \"movable blocking boundary\" in the system which can accommodate multimedia traffic and priority-based capacity access.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567543","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567543.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"192 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power assignment strategies and traffic control for wireless multimedia DS-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567543/","displayDocTitle":"Power assignment strategies and traffic control for wireless multimedia DS-CDMA systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657461","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power assignment strategies and traffic control for wireless multimedia DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027273S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"4","articleId":"567543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":567551,"authors":[{"name":"Shou-Sheu Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shou-Sheu Lin","id":"37854672300"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Rong Wu","id":"37280430600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3692-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"567551","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Decision feedback equalizers","Least squares approximation","Resonance light scattering","Time division multiple access","Mobile communication","Adaptive systems","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time division multiple access","digital radio","cellular radio","decision feedback equalisers","least mean squares methods","application specific integrated circuits","adaptive equalisers","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","multipath channels","fading","intersymbol interference","VLSI","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC design","LMS-based decision feedback equalizer","TDMA digital cellular radio","TDMA mobile communication system","adaptive decision feedback equalizer","intersymbol interference","multipath effect","fast fading characteristic","multiple-training LMS algorithm","multiple-tracking LMS algorithm","hardware implementation","North American IS-54 systems","efficient architecture","decision device","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"In a TDMA mobile communication system, an adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is the common device to compensate the intersymbol interference caused by the multipath effect. Due to the fast fading characteristic of channels, most conventional DFEs use the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm. However, it is known that the RLS algorithm is computationally intensive and not easy to implement. The LMS is well known for its simple structure, however, due to its poor tracking property, it cannot be used. Recently, a multiple-training and multiple-tracking LMS (MTT-LMS) algorithm was developed. It was shown that the DFE trained by the MTT-LMS algorithm can yield a satisfactory result at moderate mobile speed. The MTT-LMS algorithm retains the simple structure of the LMS algorithm and is suitable for hardware implementation. In this paper, we consider the ASIC design of the MTT-LMS DFE for application to North American IS-54 systems. We have designed an efficient architecture which not only has small chip area but low clock rate. We also develop a new decision device to provide the desired signal for the MTT-LMS algorithm and the implementation of the device is simpler than the conventional one.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567551","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12307/00567551.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"222 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.567551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ASIC design of an LMS-based decision feedback equalizer for TDMA digital cellular radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567551/","displayDocTitle":"The ASIC design of an LMS-based decision feedback equalizer for TDMA digital cellular radio","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5657467","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ASIC design of an LMS-based decision feedback equalizer for TDMA digital cellular radio","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00567551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029972S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"1","articleId":"567551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":567556,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This behavior was exploited in generating the constrained fractal surfaces in the work of Szeliski and Terzopoulos (1989), which were generated by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm. The algorithm involves locally perturbing a constrained spline surface with white noise until the spline surface reaches an equilibrium state. In this paper, we introduce a very fast generalized Gibbs sampler that combines two novel techniques, namely a preconditioning technique in a wavelet basis for constraining the splines and a perturbation scheme in which, unlike the traditional Gibbs sampler, all sites (surface nodes) that do not share a common neighbor are updated simultaneously. In addition, we demonstrate the capability to generate arbitrary-order fractal surfaces without resorting to blending techniques. Using this fast Gibbs sampler algorithm, we demonstrate the synthesis of realistic terrain models from sparse elevation data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567598","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271/12277/00567598.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"35","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast Gibbs sampler for synthesizing constrained fractals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 27 1996-Nov. 1 1996","displayDocTitle":"A fast Gibbs sampler for synthesizing constrained fractals","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5456759","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567598/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast Gibbs sampler for synthesizing constrained fractals","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00567598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032638S","chronDate":"Oct. 27 1996-Nov. 1 1996","isNumber":"12277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271","articleId":"567598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":567599,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Qin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhigang Qin","id":"37087292882"},{"name":"F.F.

The result for a 20-node test case is presented and it is shown that the algorithm we propose has a very good convergence property.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.1997.567599","startPage":"140","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOT.1997.567599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12328","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4283/12328/00567599.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing B-ISDN network topologies using the genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567599/","displayDocTitle":"Designing B-ISDN network topologies using the genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5664861","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Jan. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Jan 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing B-ISDN network topologies using the genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Haifa, Israel","sourcePdf":"00567599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032242S","chronDate":"12-15 Jan 1997","isNumber":"12328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4283","citationCount":"5","articleId":"567599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":567624,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

In particular, room temperature RF output power on the order of 4 W/mm with power-added efficiency approaching the ideal values for class A and B operation is available.

Such codes were studied systematically by Bredeson and Hakimi (1967) and Hakimi and Bredeson (1968) who were concerned with the problems of augmenting C to a larger [q,k,g]-code and of efficiently decoding such augmented graphical codes. We give a new approach to these problems by requiring the augmented codes to be graphical. On one hand, we present two construction methods which turn out to contain the methods proposed by Hakimi and Bredeson as special cases. As we show, this not only gives a better understanding of their construction, it also results in augmenting codes of larger dimension. We look at the case of 1-error-correcting graphical codes in some detail. In particular, we show how to obtain the extended Hamming codes as \"purely\" graphical codes by our approach. On the other hand, we follow a suggestion of Ntafos and Hakimi (1981) and use techniques from combinatorial optimization to give decoding procedures for graphical codes which turn out to be considerably more efficient than the approach via majority logic decoding proposed by Bredeson and Hakimi. We also consider the decoding problem for the even graphical code based on the complete graph K/sub 2n/ in more detail: we discuss an efficient hardware implementation of an encoding/decoding scheme for these codes and show that things may be arranged in such a way that one can also correct all adjacent double errors. Finally, we discuss nonlinear graphical codes.","doi":"10.1109/18.567663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/12338/00567663.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.567663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphical codes revisited","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567663/","displayDocTitle":"Graphical codes revisited","volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5492811","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphical codes revisited","sourcePdf":"00567663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064387S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","articleId":"567663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":567673,"authors":[{"name":"L.K.

It is shown that the use of two encoders in parallel-used to specify the in-phase and quadrature components of the transmitted signal-results in greater minimum time diversity than the conventional design in which a single encoder is used. Using this approach-which we label \"I-Q TCM\"-codes with bandwidth efficiencies of 1, 2, and 3 bits/s/Hz are described for various constraint lengths. The performance of these codes is bounded analytically and approximated via simulation; the results show a large improvement in the bit error rate (BER) when compared with conventional trellis-coded modulation (TCM) schemes when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available to the receiver. Indeed, when this approach is applied to channels with independent Rayleigh fading, the resulting coding gain is close to that implied by the cutoff rate limit, even for only moderately complex systems. The proposed codes are also simulated under less ideal assumptions. For instance, results for a 1-bit/s/Hz IQ-TCM code without CSI show a significant gain over conventional coding.

Most analyses assume the diversity branches are independent. This paper presents an analysis of the bit-error probability for receivers in which the diversity branches are correlated. Noncoherent orthogonal digital modulation (NCODM) with Rician and Rayleigh slow, nonselective fading models are assumed. Through the use of the diagonalization of quadratic forms, most of the calculations of the bit-error probability can be reduced to a two-dimensional numerical integration. For some cases for dual diversity, a closed-form expression for the error probability is given. A number of diversity combining laws, including square law and maximum likelihood, are considered. We find that Rician fading can be worse than Rayleigh fading in correlated diversity environments, a situation quite different from the independent diversity case. Also, for the Rayleigh fading model with correlated branch diversity, we find that an equal-weight, square-law combiner usually has the same error performance as the more complex maximum-likelihood combiner. However, this is not the case for a Rician fading model with the same correlation environment. Simple diagonalization methods that compensate for the lossy effect of correlation are specified and found to be effective when the dominant noise and interference have almost the same correlation distribution as the fading signals.","doi":"10.1109/18.567699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/12338/00567699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.567699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12338","startPage":"263","endPage":"274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-error-probability for noncoherent orthogonal signals in fading with optimum combining for correlated branch diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit-error-probability for noncoherent orthogonal signals in fading with optimum combining for correlated branch diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5492822","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-error-probability for noncoherent orthogonal signals in fading with optimum combining for correlated branch diversity","sourcePdf":"00567699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045746S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"36","articleId":"567699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":567703,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The performance of the optimum receiver depends only on the free distance of the code and is independent of its phase. Large reductions in receiver complexity are obtained by using reduced search detection techniques like the M-algorithm (MA). However, we show that MA detector performance depends critically on phase, and is characterized by the partial energy of the encoder or channel. The minimum phase encoder needs by far the least detector searching.

We also prove that there is a forbidden rate region of fractional coding rates that are practically unrealizable using the GCC construction.

Following this analysis, an algorithm to design the optimal rate GCC from a restriction on the maximum size of its constellation signal set is given, and a formula for determining the size of the GCC achieving a desired coding rate is derived.

Previously, we presented a system for visualizing similarities between a single DNA sequence and a large database of other DNA sequences (E.H. Chi et al., 1995). Similarity algorithms generate similarity information in textual reports that can be hundreds or thousands of pages long. Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data. Detail-on-demand is preserved by hyperlinks to the analysis reports. We present three case studies illustrating the use of these techniques. The combined technique of applying a time axis with a 3D scatter plot and query filters to visualization of biological sequence similarity data is both powerful and novel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible information visualization of multivariate data from biological sequence similarity searches","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567796","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271/12277/00567796.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 27 1996-Nov. 1 1996","displayDocTitle":"Flexible information visualization of multivariate data from biological sequence similarity searches","conferenceDate":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5456774","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible information visualization of multivariate data from biological sequence similarity searches","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00567796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050015S","chronDate":"Oct. 27 1996-Nov. 1 1996","isNumber":"12277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271","citationCount":"10","articleId":"567796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":567817,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The second MMIC is a balanced design with on-chip input and output Lange Couplers. It delivers a record 564 mW output power (27.5 dBm) with 21% PAE and 9.8 dB power gain. This represents more than a 50% increase in output power, together with record PAE and power gain. The MMICs have been designed for high reliability satellite communications, with full passivation, excellent thermal properties, backed-off drain bias, and have been fabricated on 3-inch wafers.

It is a 44% improvement over previous state-of-the-art HBT and BJT amplifiers based on InP, GaAs, or Si-Ge materials. The amplifier consists of a 2-stage direct-coupled design based on low bandgap InAlAs/InGaAs HBTs with f/sub T/'s and f/sub max/'s of 80 GHz and 200 GHz, respectively. Self-biased from a 3 V supply, the amplifier obtains 15.1 dB gain with a 22 GHz bandwidth while consuming only 34.2 mW of dc power. Biased at 5 V and 23.4 mA, a gain of 19.3 dB and a bandwidth of 25 GHz was achieved with a corresponding open circuit transimpedance of 59.5 dB-/spl Omega/ (944 /spl Omega/) and 25 GHz. Effective 50 /spl Omega/ output loaded transimpedance is 52.7 dB-/spl Omega/ with a GHz bandwidth. The effective transimpedance bandwidth-product is 10.3 THz-/spl Omega/ and is 21% higher than the previous record of 8.5 THz-/spl Omega/ for an AlGaAs/GaAs HBT which consumes more than twice the dc power. This work illustrates the high gain-bandwidth and speed performance which InAlAs/InGaAs HBTs can achieve with very little dc power and suggests great potential for future high data rate IC applications such as optical-electronic communications.","doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1996.567829","displayPublicationTitle":"GaAs IC Symposium IEEE Gallium Arsenide Integrated Circuit Symposium. 18th Annual Technical Digest 1996","pdfPath":"/iel3/4207/12287/00567829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAAS.1996.567829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12287","publicationTitle":"GaAs IC Symposium IEEE Gallium Arsenide Integrated Circuit Symposium. 18th Annual Technical Digest 1996","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Low dc power high-gain bandwidth product InAlAs/InGaAs-InP HBT direct-coupled amplifiers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5520471","publicationDate":"1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low dc power high-gain bandwidth product InAlAs/InGaAs-InP HBT direct-coupled amplifiers","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00567829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04726S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4207","citationCount":"19","articleId":"567829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":567831,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The amplifier features 1/spl times/4 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ single-emitter HBTs with a base under-cut structure for reducing the device's collector-base capacitance C/sub bc/, resulting in as much as a 20% improvement in device f/sub max/ performance.

A nonlinear modeling methodology is developed to identify the root cause of subharmonic oscillations and provides a means to implement circuit techniques to suppress this mode of oscillation without degrading the desired power amplifier performance. This modeling based technique is enabled through the use of a time domain MESFET model which achieves excellent convergence by avoiding the discontinuity in high-order derivatives that is typical of implementations that use conditional functions. This technique allows the design engineer for the first time the ability to determine apriori the large signal stability of a power amplifier operating into a severe mismatch and implement circuit solutions prior to MMIC fabrication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/567896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5540029","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"New insight into subharmonic oscillation mode of GaAs power amplifiers under severe output mismatch condition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New insight into subharmonic oscillation mode of GaAs power amplifiers under severe output mismatch condition","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00567896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029724S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4207","citationCount":"2","articleId":"567896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":567926,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In order to perform placement for very large designs, the currently followed approach of placing flat netlists is extremely time consuming.

In this paper we describe an approach for the constraint-based FPGA floorplanning of flexible and fixed macro blocks. Our approach is to construct a floorplan of small area that respects the input constraint set. The input constraint set is derived from topological placement of the macro blocks based on both FPGA architectural constraints and ASIC design.

Full-state feedback, full-state command controllers are shown, utilizing both filter inductor current and filter capacitor current feedback to augment output voltage control. All controllers presented include output voltage decoupling in a manner analogous to \"back EMF\" decoupling in DC motor drives. Disturbance input decoupling of the load current and its derivative is presented. An observer-based controller is additionally considered and is shown to be a technically viable, economically attractive option.

Very high temperatures were used at the wafer level to accelerate breakdown so tests could be conducted at electric fields as low as 4.5 MV/cm. New observations are reported for TDDB that suggest a consistent electric field and temperature dependence for intrinsic breakdown and a changing breakdown mechanism as a function of electric field. The results show that the logarithm of the median-test-time-to failure, log (t/sub 50/), is described by a linear electric field dependence with a field acceleration parameter that is not dependent on temperature. It has a value of approximately 1 decade/MV/cm for the range of oxide thicknesses studied and shows a slight decreasing trend with decreasing oxide thickness. The thermal activation E/sub a/ ranged between 0.7 and 0.95 eV for electric fields below 9.0 MV/cm for all oxide thicknesses. TDDB tests conducted under pulsed bias indicate that increased dielectric lifetime is observed under unipolar and bipolar pulsed stress conditions, but diminishes as the stress electric field and oxide thickness are reduced. This observation provides new evidence that low electric field aging and breakdown is not dominated by charge generation and trapping.","doi":"10.1109/16.568042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/12340/00568042.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.568042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low electric field breakdown of thin SiO/sub 2/ films under static and dynamic stress","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568042/","displayDocTitle":"Low electric field breakdown of thin SiO/sub 2/ films under static and dynamic stress","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5569174","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low electric field breakdown of thin SiO/sub 2/ films under static and dynamic stress","sourcePdf":"00568042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049885S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"95","articleId":"568042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":568045,"authors":[{"name":"I.Y.

This is especially acute in systems that are idling most of the time. In order to meet the opposing requirements of high performance at reduced power supply voltage and low-static leakage power during idle periods, a dynamic threshold voltage control scheme is proposed. A novel Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI)-based technology called Silicon-On-Insulator-with-Active-Substrate (SOIAS) was developed whereby a back-gate is used to control the threshold voltage of the front-gate; this concept was demonstrated on a selectively scaled CMOS process implementing discrete devices and ring oscillators. For a 250 mV switch in threshold voltage, a reduction of 3-4 decades in subthreshold leakage current was measured.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"822","endPage":"831","doi":"10.1109/16.568045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.568045","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/12340/00568045.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back-gated CMOS on SOIAS for dynamic threshold voltage control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Back-gated CMOS on SOIAS for dynamic threshold voltage control","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5574637","volume":"44","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back-gated CMOS on SOIAS for dynamic threshold voltage control","sourcePdf":"00568045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036461S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"87","articleId":"568045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568052,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The power module is modeled by accounting for various thermal resistances including those contributed by the package, contact metallization and intrinsic device material.

These techniques result in a reduction in the computations necessary per convolution as compared to directly using the coefficients. It is shown analytically that this computational reduction at the price of more storage can result in a reduction in net energy dissipated.

We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements.

This integration of digital and analog circuits into closely coupled mixed-signal circuits has brought with it, many challenges in the design and test areas. The problem in testing mixed-signal circuits arises from the simple fact that digital and analog fault models are inherently different. Moreover, while digital fault models are well understood (i.e. stuck-at faults), analog fault models are not quite as well-defined and mature. Another key problem stems from the fact that analog signals are inherently imprecise. Hence, with any analog measurement one must associate an accuracy of measurement. For large systems, it therefore becomes necessary to incorporate design for testability and built-in self-test (BIST) features in order to achieve high coverage of digital and analog faults. Also, with use of these features, fault simulation and test generation becomes easier. In the following paper, the authors discuss recent work in the area of design for testability and BIST.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1997.568158","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Tenth International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Tenth International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4286/12337/00568158.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"392","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1997.568158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design for testability and built-in self-test of mixed-signal circuits: a tutorial","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design for testability and built-in self-test of mixed-signal circuits: a tutorial","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5565782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568158/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design for testability and built-in self-test of mixed-signal circuits: a tutorial","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"00568158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05138S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 1997","isNumber":"12337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286","citationCount":"15","articleId":"568158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":568171,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The resulting self-biased op-amps are free from the above mentioned drawbacks and exhibit the same performance as existing folded casode op amps, except for a small reduction in slew rate.

The second algorithm is a parallel modulo algorithm that uses table look up to speed up computation. The time complexity is O(logn), the AT/sup 2/ measure is O((n logn)/sup 2/), and it can also be implemented using a systolic architecture. Used with a O(logn) multiplier, it can perform module multiplication in O(logn) time. Both the algorithms have the advantage that the circuit is independent of the modulus N.

Parallel implementations can potentially provide significant speedups while retaining good quality results. In this paper, we present three parallel genetic algorithms for simulation-based sequential circuit test generation. Simulation-based test generators are more capable of handling the constraints of complex design features than deterministic test generators. The three parallel genetic algorithm implementations are portable and scalable over a wide range of distributed and shared memory MIMD machines. Significant speedups were obtained, and fault coverages were similar to and occasionally better than those obtained using a sequential genetic algorithm, due to the parallel search strategies adopted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568180/","accessionNumber":"5565798","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parallel genetic algorithms for simulation-based sequential circuit test generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel genetic algorithms for simulation-based sequential circuit test generation","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"00568180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048628S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan 1997","isNumber":"12337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286","citationCount":"12","articleId":"568180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":568192,"authors":[{"name":"W.

They illustrate how the routers of an IP network could be augmented to perform such customized processing on the datagrams flowing through them. These active routers could also interoperate with legacy routers, which transparently forward datagrams in the traditional manner.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1997","volume":"35","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5487031","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A survey of active network research","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of active network research","sourcePdf":"00568214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055004S","chronDate":"Jan.  1997","isNumber":"12280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"830","articleId":"568214","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":568219,"authors":[{"name":"B.L.

The model accommodates two different loading scenarios: one in which the heat is distributed evenly across the cable tray cross section; and one which concentrates the heavily loaded cables along the centerline, while surrounding them with more lightly loaded cables. The temperature predictions provided by the model are compared to data found in other IEEE papers, data collected in laboratory measurements, and new data from a four-year study of cable trays in an operating nuclear plant. Reasons for differences between the field data and the computer results are discussed. The model is used to evaluate the conservatism in the available Codes and Standards. A derating factor is introduced that is defined in terms of the ampacity of power cables in open-top trays. The derating factor accounts for the added thermal resistance present when a cover is placed over the cables, trapping a layer of stagnant air on top of the cable mass. The computer model is then used to predict values for the derating factor as a function of cable depth. The derating factor is shown to be independent of the composition of cables in the tray. The presence of a cover is shown to reduce the ampacity based on an uncovered tray by up to 25 percent depending on the depth of the cables in the tray.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Temperature","Power cables","Thermal resistance","Thermal loading","Mathematical model","Laboratories","Nuclear measurements","Code standards","Thermal factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power cables","thermal analysis","temperature distribution","power engineering computing","heat transfer","electric conduits","power cable testing","thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power cable ampacity","single covered trays","mathematical thermal model","loading scenarios","experimental testing","temperature predictions","codes","computer simulation","standards","derating factor","thermal resistance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/61.568219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/12336/00568219.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.568219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ampacity of cables in single covered trays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ampacity of cables in single covered trays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568219/","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5499182","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ampacity of cables in single covered trays","sourcePdf":"00568219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031308S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"7","articleId":"568219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":568225,"authors":[{"name":"U.A.

This error is influenced by the actual power system condition. Although accounted for by using a large safety margin in the zone boundaries, unexpected overreach can still occur and the operation speed is decreased. Adaptive protection offers an approach to compensate for the influence of the variable power system conditions. By adapting the relay settings to the actual power system condition, the relay will respond more accurately to power system faults. The selectivity of the protection system is increased, as is the power system reliability. In this paper, an adaptive distance relaying concept is presented. In order to minimize the required communication, local measurements are used to estimate the entire power system condition. An artificial neural network is used to estimate the actual power system condition and to calculate the appropriate tripping impedance. Application of this concept to the model of the Dutch 380 kV power system has resulted in an enormous increase in relaying accuracy. The relaying error is reduced substantially. Most importantly, the standard deviation, indicating the relay's sensitivity to power system condition variations, is reduced to nearly zero. The zone boundary is kept nearly constant, which facilitates the relay coordination. The selectivity of the entire power system protection system is improved. It is shown that adaptive protection improves the protection system selectivity, and that artificial neural networks can very well be used to estimate the actual power system condition.","doi":"10.1109/61.568229","startPage":"97","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.568229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12336","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/12336/00568229.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive distance protection of double-circuit lines using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568229/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive distance protection of double-circuit lines using artificial neural networks","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5499192","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive distance protection of double-circuit lines using artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00568229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030798S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"45","articleId":"568229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":568230,"authors":[{"name":"Z.Q.

Reliable and fast phase selection is thus imperative in order to avoid potential problems of system insecurity and instability. Conventional phase selectors, primarily based on power frequency measurands, can suffer some impairment in performance because of their heavy dependency on varying system and fault conditions. However, the advent of artificial neural networks (ANNs), with their ability to map complex and highly nonlinear input/output patterns, provides an attractive potential solution to the long-standing problems of accurate and fast phase selection. This paper describes the design of a novel phase selector using ANNs. The technique is based on utilising fault generated high frequency noise (captured through the high voltage coupling capacitor of a conventional capacitor voltage transformer) to essentially recognise the various patterns generated within the frequency spectra of the fault generated noise signals on the three phases, for the purposes of accurately deducing the faulted phase. The paper demonstrates a new concept and methodology in phase selection which will facilitate single-pole autoreclosure applications in power systems.","doi":"10.1109/61.568230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/12336/00568230.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.568230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to phase selection using fault generated high frequency noise and neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568230/","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to phase selection using fault generated high frequency noise and neural networks","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5505103","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to phase selection using fault generated high frequency noise and neural networks","sourcePdf":"00568230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034694S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"73","articleId":"568230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":568231,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

In power system analysis, the /spl alpha//spl beta/-transform is used to convert three phase quantities to a complex quantity where the real part is the in-phase component and the imaginary part is the quadrature component. This complex signal is demodulated with a known complex phasor rotating in opposite direction to the input. The advantage of this method is that the demodulation does not introduce a double frequency component. For signals with high signal to noise ratio, the filtering demand for the double frequency component can often limit the speed of the frequency estimator. Hence, the method can improve fast frequency estimation of signals with good noise properties. The method loses its benefits for noisy signals, where the filter design is governed by the demand to filter harmonics and white noise. The method has been previously published, but not explored to its potential. The paper presents four examples to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568235/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5505108","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Frequency estimation by demodulation of two complex signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency estimation by demodulation of two complex signals","sourcePdf":"00568235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016096S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"113","articleId":"568235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":568251,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The objective of the shunt active filter is to damp harmonic propagation, which results from harmonic resonance between many capacitors for power factor improvement and line inductors in the feeder, rather than to minimize voltage distortion throughout the feeder. Harmonic mitigation is a welcome \"by-product\" of the shunt active filter, which comes from damping of harmonic propagation. This paper concludes that the shunt active filter based on detection of voltage at the point of installation is superior in stability to others, and that the best site selection is not the beginning terminal but the end terminal of the primary line in the feeder. Computer simulation is performed to verify the validity and effectiveness of the shunt active filter by means of an analog circuit simulator, which is characterized by installing it on a feeder of a radial distribution system in a residential area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568259/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","volume":"12","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5510987","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control strategy and site selection of a shunt active filter for damping of harmonic propagation in power distribution systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control strategy and site selection of a shunt active filter for damping of harmonic propagation in power distribution systems","sourcePdf":"00568259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042556S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"264","articleId":"568259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":568265,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This compensator, called static synchronous series compensator (SSSC), can provide controllable compensating voltage over an identical capacitive and inductive range, independently of the magnitude of the line current. It is immune to classical network resonances. In addition to series reactive compensation, with an external DC power supply it can also compensate the voltage drop across the resistive component of the line impedance. The compensation of the real part of the impedance can maintain high X/R ratio even if the line has a very high degree of series compensation. Concurrent and coordinated modulation of reactive and real compensation can greatly increase power oscillation damping. The paper discusses the basic operating and performance characteristics of the SSSC, and compares them to those characterizing the more conventional compensators based on thyristor-switched or controlled series capacitors. It also presents some of the results of TNA simulations carried out with an SSSC hardware model.","doi":"10.1109/61.568265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/12336/00568265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.568265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12336","startPage":"406","endPage":"417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static synchronous series compensator: a solid-state approach to the series compensation of transmission lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Static synchronous series compensator: a solid-state approach to the series compensation of transmission lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5510993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static synchronous series compensator: a solid-state approach to the series compensation of transmission lines","sourcePdf":"00568265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025176S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"382","articleId":"568265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568275,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the output of the CPB, each of the many channels represents a vertical beam that is focused in the direction of correlated acoustic energy arriving at the array of vertically spaced sonar elements. Within each of the CPB principal beams, nulls are formed in the direction of the remaining acoustic paths thereby canceling interference. A vertical array of 64 elements operating at 245 kHz has been used in shallow water experiments to evaluate performance under various conditions. The experiments were performed in shallow water high multipath conditions off Boca Raton.

Short duration, pulsed carrier signals were used to estimate the impulse response of the channel and these observations were related to the performance of a parametric communication system operating under the same conditions. The statistical characteristics and spectra of the amplitude and phase fluctuations were used to analyse the pulsed response over short observation periods. Typically, the amplitude fluctuations experienced by the main path were Ricean in nature with a spectral content in the sub-Hertz range whilst the phase fluctuations tended towards more Gaussian-like behaviour with a comparable frequency spectra. Under these conditions a high data rate differential phase shift keyed (DPSK) telemetry link was established over a 1.7 km path. The ensuing performance of the communication system, characterised by the bit error rate for various symbol rates, is presented and demonstrates the viability of a parametric telemetry system.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1996.568336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1996.568336","endPage":"831 vol.2","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 96 MTS/IEEE Conference Proceedings.

The attractive features of a parametric array are its wide bandwidth and its narrow beamwidth. Other advantages are the lightness and smallness of the array. Conversely parametric transduction requires great transmitting power. The experimental conditions are presented. Two parametric communications were conducted. The first one used FSK modulation with hopping which gives good protection against time spreading and is robust against synchronization problems. The error rate varied from 10/sup -5/ to error free and allowed very good image transmission. A second SSB communication is presented to compare voice transmission using parametric transduction with standard underwater telephony. Very good results much better than with standard uw telephone, were obtained and reveal the interest of such a parametric application. The results obtained with different types of modulations (FSK, BPSF, MSK and linear FM) are then presented and the transfer function of the array is analysed. An important result is that the received signals are very close transmitted. The transfer function behavior parametric array is quasi-linear and the great available bandwidth allows numerous applications in communication, detection, localization, target characterization.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1996.568338","startPage":"839","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 96 MTS/IEEE Conference Proceedings.

Due to mission, space, and power requirements the use and storage of multispectral imagery in compressed form is preferred. In this paper, the authors discuss the spatial and statistical characteristics of UW imagery that facilitate compression by well-known algorithms such as JPEG, vector quantization (VQ), and visual pattern image coding (VPIC). For example, they consider statistical distributions of target and background greylevels obtained from truthed imagery, as well as power spectral analysis of target-background differences. The former measures facilitate parameter selection in VQ and and VPIC, while the latter are important in JPEG. Preliminary results are given for recently-developed algorithms that yield compression ratios ranging from 5,500:1 to 16,500:1 based on prefiltered six-band multispectral imagery of resolution 720/spl times/480 pixels. The prefiltering step, which removes unwanted background objects, is key to achieving high compression.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1996.568357","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 96 MTS/IEEE Conference Proceedings.

The receiver extends a block decision feedback equalization (block-DFE) structure proposed by Williamson, Kennedy and Pulford in 1992. Their algorithm improved performance in examples of known channels with intersymbol interference. The new receiver uses an adaptive block-DFE structure which includes carrier recovery for fractionally spaced inputs. It significantly improves bit error rates in difficult unknown channels while reducing the number of adaptive coefficients compared to a similar adaptive DFE receiver. Performance curves of the adaptive block-DFE and adaptive DFE receivers are shown for several well-known example channels.

With a required operating region of 2 km range and 100 m depth, acoustic telemetry is the only realistic option. The major problems in acoustic telemetry through such a channel are limited bandwidth, time-varying multipath due to surface and bottom reflections and Doppler effects caused by relative motion of the ROV and surface vessel. To achieve the data rates required for real time image transmission, bandwidth efficient modulation schemes such as QPSK must be employed. It was found that a combination of adaptive beamforming and equalisation was required to combat the effects of multipath and achieve an acceptable bit error rate. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate data rates of 20 kbits/s (10 ksym/s, QPSK) achieved over ranges up to 2 km, with bit error rates <10/sup -4/.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1996.568369","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 96 MTS/IEEE Conference Proceedings.

This advantage of DS/SS, however, is only when the time difference of propagation delay between paths is greater than a chip duration. In indoor communications, the delay spread is often very small and the above condition on the delay and chip duration is no longer satisfied, and this performance improvement by the path diversity with conventional DS/SS systems cannot be expected. In this paper we propose a new diversity technique for indoor wireless communication systems where delay spread is smaller than a chip duration. In this system, the transmitter sends signals at the same time from multiple antennas with intentional time delays, which allow a receiver to distinguish and combine the signals from different antennas.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568393","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568393.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"812 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The DS/CDMA system using transmission diversity for indoor wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568393/","displayDocTitle":"The DS/CDMA system using transmission diversity for indoor wireless communications","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664883","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The DS/CDMA system using transmission diversity for indoor wireless communications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035921S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"8","articleId":"568393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":568395,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Jo Lee","id":"37087183261"},{"name":"Dae-Joong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae-Joong Kim","id":"37087835281"},{"name":"Sung-Lark Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Lark Kwon","id":"37087355644"},{"name":"Chang-Eon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang-Eon Kang","id":"37086990887"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3692-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"568395","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568395","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["History","Decoding","Viterbi algorithm","State estimation","Intersymbol interference","Decision feedback equalizers","Filters","Mobile communication","Detectors","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","radio receivers","adaptive estimation","estimation theory","multipath channels","fading","Viterbi decoding","least mean squares methods","recursive estimation","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RSSE receiver","channel estimator","path history","mobile communication systems","reduced state sequence estimation","channel parameters tracking","adaptive receiver","adaptive channel estimator","error propagation","Viterbi decoder","path metric","decoding","adaptation algorithms","least mean square","LMS algorithm","recursive least square","RLS algorithm","computer simulation results","performance","multipath fading channels","transversal filter"]}],"abstract":"For mobile communication systems, the RSSE (reduced state sequence estimation) receiver must be made adaptive to learn and to track the channel parameters.

This paper presents a new channel estimator using the path history in the Viterbi decoder for preventing error propagation. The selection of the path history depends on the path metric as in the decoding of the Viterbi decoder in the RSSE. A discussion on the channel estimator with different adaptation algorithms such as the least mean square (LMS) algorithm and recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is provided.

The allocation on different spectrum can avoid the serious performance degradation as transitioning from fully loaded analog FM/FDMA to N-CDMA. The guard-band needed between the adjacent spectrum to maintain acceptable performance degradation is derived and evaluated. Numerical results indicate that at least a 255 kHz bandwidth to separate the two systems is necessary. The worst case of the interference from FDMA degrades the performance of N-CDMA, even under appropriate guard-band separation.

The method is based on the maximum likelihood criterion making effective use of \"cyclostationary property\" of the orthogonal multi-carrier modulation signal, and requires no special signal such as pilot tones to assist the estimation. After a likelihood function for the estimation is derived, an optimum estimator which maximizes the likelihood function is proposed. In addition, in order to reduce the estimator complexity, a suboptimum estimator is also proposed. Computer simulation results show that the optimum estimator requires only about 10 observation symbols for the accurate estimation in a frequency selective slow Rayleigh fading channel as well as in an additive white Gaussian noise channel, and the suboptimum estimator is effective because of the low complexity, although it requires a longer observation period.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568404","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","startPage":"863","endPage":"867 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum synchronization of orthogonal multi-carrier modulated signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum synchronization of orthogonal multi-carrier modulated signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568404/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664894","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum synchronization of orthogonal multi-carrier modulated signals","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040695S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"13","articleId":"568404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":568408,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Rong Wu","id":"37087156588"},{"name":"Yih-Ming Tsuie","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yih-Ming Tsuie","id":"37087580622"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3692-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"568408","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Time division multiple access","Resonance light scattering","Mobile communication","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Least squares methods","Computational modeling","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","time division multiple access","intersymbol interference","decision feedback equalisers","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","fading","error statistics","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","computational complexity","interference suppression","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalizer","digital cellular radio","TDMA","mobile communication system","intersymbol interference","multipath effect","DFE","North American IS-54 system","fast fading","multiple-training","multiple-tracking","LMS-based equalization","coded digital verification color code","bit error rate","low complexity","80 km/h"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568408","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568408.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"887 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LMS-based decision feedback equalizer for digital cellular radio","abstract":"In a TDMA mobile communication system, the equalizer is a common device to compensate the intersymbol interference caused by the multipath effect. In this paper, we consider the decision feedback equalizer (DFE) for application to the North American IS-54 systems. Due to the fast fading characteristic of channels, most conventional DFEs use the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm. However, it is known that the RLS algorithm is computationally intensive and not easy to implement. In this paper, we employ the ideas of multiple-training and multiple-tracking to propose an LMS-based equalization scheme. We also incorporate the coded digital verification color code (CDVCC) of the TDMA slot as an additional training sequence. Simulation results show that the new scheme can achieve a bit error rate of 3% at the mobile speed of 80 km/hr and still have low complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664898","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An LMS-based decision feedback equalizer for digital cellular radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LMS-based decision feedback equalizer for digital cellular radio","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028585S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"1","articleId":"568408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":568414,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed S-PCNs are Iridium, Inmarsat-P, Globalstar, Odyssey and Ellipso. The first two systems propose to use a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and the others code division multiple access (CDMA) scheme. It is claimed that CDMA based S-PCNs can share the allocated frequency bands due to the interference resistant property of CDMA. Spectrum sharing must be based on defined interference criteria being satisfied. The interference events are based on the statistics of carrier to interference ratio (C/I). For this a computer simulation was developed to model the dynamic nature of any constellation, and produces all the statistical values of C/I to a mobile in a fading channel. The simulation includes constellations results of proposed S-PCNs with multi-spotbeam antennas (MBA). We present the results of the investigation on the effect of imperfect power control on the total system capacity for a totally overlapped band sharing scenario. Results for a band segmented scenario are also presented for comparison.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568443","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568443.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1058 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect on total system capacity due to imperfect power control for band sharing between CDMA based non-geostationary satellite-PCNs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568443/","displayDocTitle":"Effect on total system capacity due to imperfect power control for band sharing between CDMA based non-geostationary satellite-PCNs","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664933","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect on total system capacity due to imperfect power control for band sharing between CDMA based non-geostationary satellite-PCNs","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032662S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"2","articleId":"568443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":568445,"authors":[{"name":"B.

By using OFDM modulation with a long symbol interval, this scheme overcomes the complex and costly equalization requirements associated with single carrier systems. Moreover, the need for highly linear power amplifiers typically required in OFDM systems is alleviated through the use of multiple transmit antennas combined with nonlinear coding. The clustering technique also leads to a natural implementation of transmit diversity. This paper reports on the implementation of a clustered-OFDM transmitter which was constructed using off-the-shelf components in a relatively short period of time. Despite the limitations associated with the prototyped system, it can deliver 7.5 Mbps and it is expected that this data rate could be easily tripled with existing technology. In addition to providing an introduction to clustered-OFDM, we describe the various architectural trade-offs which were made in order to reduce the hardware complexity of the boards as well as some experimental results showing the operation of the transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568445","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568445.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","startPage":"1064","endPage":"1068 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered-OFDM transmitter implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustered-OFDM transmitter implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568445/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664935","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered-OFDM transmitter implementation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034144S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"19","articleId":"568445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568446,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Our approach is more detailed than previous studies, in that it takes into account the specific coding/modulation scheme and it tracks the fading process symbol by symbol. It is shown that a Markov approximation for the block error process (possibly degenerating into an i.i.d. process for sufficiently fast fading) is a very good model for a broad range of parameters. Also, it is observed that the relationship between the marginal error rate and the transition probability is largely insensitive to parameters such as block length, degree of forward error correction and modulation format, and only depends on an appropriately normalized version of the Doppler frequency. This observation leads to a unified approach for the channel modelling which simplifies the performance analysis of upper-layer protocols.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568447","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","startPage":"1074","endPage":"1078 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markov model for block errors on fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Markov model for block errors on fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568447/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664937","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markov model for block errors on fading channels","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038376S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"43","articleId":"568447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568448,"authors":[{"name":"E.

For these data rates it was found that OFDM presents a significantly lower computational burden.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568450","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568450.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","startPage":"1088","endPage":"1091 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of computational complexity of adaptive equalization and OFDM for indoor wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of computational complexity of adaptive equalization and OFDM for indoor wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568450/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664940","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of computational complexity of adaptive equalization and OFDM for indoor wireless networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024989S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"10","articleId":"568450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568454,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Hwan You","id":"37087162201"},{"name":"Young-Jo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Jo Lee","id":"37087183261"},{"name":"Jong-Heon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Heon Kim","id":"37087179855"},{"name":"Chang-Eon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang-Eon Kang","id":"37086990887"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3692-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"568454","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Matched filters","Rician channels","Electronic mail","System performance","Mobile communication","Signal to noise ratio","Performance analysis","Testing","Channel bank filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","Rician channels","code division multiple access","probability","fading","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code acquisition","threshold detection techniques","psuedo-noise matched filters","direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems","detection probability","false alarm probability","nonselective Rician fading channels","nonfading channels","PN codes","SNR","serial scheme","parallel scheme","system performance","DS-SS systems"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection techniques for code acquisition in direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems employing PN matched filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568454","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568454","startPage":"1106","endPage":"1110 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","abstract":"This paper presents threshold detection techniques for direct sequence code acquisition employing psuedo-noise (PN) matched filters. The probabilities of detection and false alarm are derived as a measure of the system performance in both nonfading and nonselective Rician fading channels. For received PN codes with different SNR, the proposed acquisition schemes (serial and parallel) are able to detect a desired threshold in the search mode so that this value is utilized as a threshold for the verification mode. It is shown that the serial scheme achieves lower probability of false alarm than the acquisition scheme based on the Neyman-Nearson criterion, giving comparable performance in terms of the probability of detection.

In our study, the total bandwidth expansion factor caused by coding and spreading is fixed and the channel is assumed to exhibit Rayleigh flat fading. The objective is to assess the performance of various quadratic detectors as a function of the spreading factor and the fade rate. Specifically, four detectors were considered: chip level differential detection, chip level maximum likelihood sequence estimation, noncoherent detection, and perfect coherent detection. It was found that in the presence of fast Rayleigh fading, different detectors behave differently when the spreading factor varies. For example, the chip level differential detector and the ideal coherent detector favour a small spreading factor and a low rate code, while the MLSE prefers a high rate code and a high spreading factor. For the noncoherent detector, there actually exists an optimal system configuration at certain fade rates.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568457","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568457.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1124 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined coding and quadratic detection for DS/CDMA systems operating in Rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combined coding and quadratic detection for DS/CDMA systems operating in Rayleigh fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568457/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5671679","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined coding and quadratic detection for DS/CDMA systems operating in Rayleigh fading channels","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032507S","chronDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"2","articleId":"568457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":568459,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

For random access schemes, dynamic behavior of a CDMA channel implies that we must be cautious in choosing an evaluation model which has to include the effect of dynamic error rates. The approach shown in this paper is to employ a Poisson error model which takes the occurrence of errors as a Poisson process and the occurring rate is dependent on the channel traffic. Based on this assumption, a continuous-time Markov chain model can be further developed to evaluate the throughput and delay performance. This approach can certainly apply to evaluation of many random access protocols.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568466","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568466.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1167 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation model for integrated services on CDMA wireless LANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568466/","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation model for integrated services on CDMA wireless LANs","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664953","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation model for integrated services on CDMA wireless LANs","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026108S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","articleId":"568466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":568471,"authors":[{"name":"Jeich Mar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze Institute of Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeich Mar","id":"37325213100"},{"name":"Hung-Yi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze Institute of Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hung-Yi Chen","id":"37367750000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3692-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"568471","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Frequency-selective fading channels","Performance analysis","Power control","Base stations","Bit error rate","Binary phase shift keying","Land mobile radio","Power system modeling","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading","Rayleigh channels","cellular radio","multipath channels","error statistics","phase shift keying","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","cellular CDMA system","frequency-selective fading channels","multipath effects","code division multiple access","bit error rate","BER","forward link","reverse link","Rayleigh channels","coherent BPSK modulation","asynchronous direct-sequence spread spectrum","imperfect power control"]}],"abstract":"An effect of multipath on the performance of cellular code division multiple access (CDMA) is investigated.

It is aimed at improving the throughput and message delay delivery when traffic load values below the saturation point of the conventional DS-CDMA slotted-ALOHA system are sensed in the channel. For this purpose a mobile assisted algorithm is envisaged to control the change of the transmission rate according to the traffic load. This algorithm revealed that the optimum behavior, obtained using a Markov chain model, may be almost reached at a low complexity cost. Moreover, priorities between mobiles could be easily established. Finally, a traffic model based on a realistic statistical length distribution of the messages illustrates how the delay delivery can be greatly reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4273/12310/00568472.pdf","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1196 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PIMRC '96 - 7th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1996.568472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mobile controlled algorithm for improving the throughput in a S-ALOHA DS-CDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Delay","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Cost function","Packet radio networks","Radio spectrum management","Multiple access interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","packet radio networks","telecommunication traffic","channel capacity","access protocols","Markov processes","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile controlled algorithm","throughput improvement","S-ALOHA","DS-CDMA system","slotted-ALOHA","packet random access scheme","transmitter-based spreading codes","message delay delivery","traffic load","transmission rate","Markov chain model","low complexity","statistical length distribution","adaptive technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A mobile controlled algorithm for improving the throughput in a S-ALOHA DS-CDMA system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5664959","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mobile controlled algorithm for improving the throughput in a S-ALOHA DS-CDMA system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00568472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039817S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273","citationCount":"4","articleId":"568472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":568477,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Thus the full capacity of an SDMA cell can only be made use of by an effective channel allocation scheme. In this paper, a real time concept for channel allocation is presented.

Rayleigh fading model is used to represent multipath fading channel within indoor transmission. BER performance of the proposed OFDM/FHMA hybrid system is conducted for 8QAM; 16QAM, coherent BPSK, and DBPSK modulation techniques in conjunction with Reed-Solomon forward error correction code. Raw data rate, bandwidth utilization, user capacity, and BER curves are calculated and simulated with respect to CELP voice coding (9.6Kbps) serial input data. Analysis shows high speed data up to 465 Kbps (utilizing entire OFDM block), 48 voice channels, and bandwidth utilization of 43% can be achieved using 16QAM modulation at BER of 10/sup -4/. Attractive advantages of OFDM/FHMA hybrid system are listed for its potential in future generation PCS. The analysis also concludes that the proposed system possesses the low speed data transmission capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12335/00568564.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"373 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.568564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.568564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM/FHMA hybrid system operation in ISM band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Bit error rate","Personal communication networks","Data communication","OFDM modulation","Bandwidth","Rayleigh channels","Fading","Binary phase shift keying","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","linear predictive coding","cellular radio","personal communication networks","data communication","voice communication","land mobile radio","frequency hop communication","multi-access systems","fading","Rayleigh channels","multipath channels","indoor radio","quadrature amplitude modulation","phase shift keying","differential phase shift keying","Reed-Solomon codes","forward error correction","error correction codes","channel capacity","channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","OFDM/FHMA hybrid system operation","ISM band","wireless PCS","pico cell level","data transmission","high user capacity","system parameters","FCC's regulated operation","Rayleigh fading model","multipath fading channel","indoor transmission","BER performance","8QAM","16QAM","coherent BPSK","DBPSK","modulation techniques","Reed-Solomon forward error correction code","raw data rate","bandwidth utilization","user capacity","CELP voice coding","2400 to 2483.5 MHz","465 Kbit/s","9.6 Kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM/FHMA hybrid system operation in ISM band","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5608959","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of OFDM/FHMA hybrid system operation in ISM band","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00568564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035596S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","articleId":"568564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568567,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

The maximum a-posteriori turbo decoder, unlike the Viterbi decoder often used for convolutional codes, explicitly uses E/sub b//N/sub 0/ as a parameter in the decoding process. We have investigated the effects of errors in estimating the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ on turbo code bit error rate (BER) performance in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and binary symmetric channels (BSCs). Both small (220 bit) and large (65535 bit) buffers have been tested. For a BSC without any E/sub b//N/sub 0/ estimation error, the small buffer turbo code yields a BER of 10/sup -3/ at an E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 3.9 dB and the large buffer turbo code yields a BER of 10/sup -5/ at an E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 3 dB. The small interleaver turbo code operating over a two link satellite demod/remod channel produces a net BER of 10/sup -3/ with an uplink E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 5 dB and a downlink E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 6.6 dB. When E/sub b//N/sub 0/ estimation errors are included in the AWGN or BSCs, the results indicate that errors of up to several dB can be tolerated before the onset of significant degradation in turbo code performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.568576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12345","startPage":"17","endPage":"21 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12345/00568576.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of channel characteristics on turbo code performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"The effects of channel characteristics on turbo code performance","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5601748","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of channel characteristics on turbo code performance","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00568576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075139S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"45","articleId":"568576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":568581,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.J.

The main objective of this program is to provide beyond line of sight communications (BLOS) capabilities within an area of operations under direct control of the theater commander without using scarce satellite resources. The S&TCD effort includes the planning and implementation of a series of demonstrations and advanced warfighting experiments compatible with overall BITS schedules and goals. It is planned to use UAVs as platforms for a high capacity trunk radio relay, and a UAV based battlefield broadcast system. Future applications are expected to include an airborne personal communications system. The range of coverage provided by practical airborne platforms, a function of altitude and the elevation or look angle of the transmitters or receivers, can vary from 50 to 100 miles for UAVs of interest. The platform payload for all applications will be bent-pipe, non-processing, block conversion type transponders with provisions for cross-banding. All antennas are to be wide beam, at least 165/spl deg/ in elevation and 360/spl deg/ in azimuth with the potential for implementing shaped beam or tracking antennas. To be effectively applied, airborne relays using UAVs must maintain compatibility with the existing and planned terrestrial and space communications infrastructures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Relays","Satellite broadcasting","Communication system control","Artificial satellites","Radio broadcasting","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Payloads","Transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military aircraft","military communication","aircraft communication","radio repeaters","radio broadcasting","transponders","radio equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicle","communications relay","UAV","Army Communications Electronics Command","Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate","airborne communications range extension program","Battlefield Information Transmission System","beyond line of sight communications","S&TCD","high capacity trunk radio relay","battlefield broadcast system","airborne personal communications system","platform payload","bent-pipe non-processing block conversion type transponders","wide beam antennas","shaped beam antennas","tracking antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568581","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.568581","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12345/00568581.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.568581","startPage":"47","endPage":"51 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12345","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications relay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications relay","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5601753","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications relay","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00568581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053316S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"31","articleId":"568581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568612,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

The receiver consists of the conventional matched filter followed by a tapped delay line with the provision of incorporating the use of antenna arrays. It has the ability of suppressing multiple-access interference (MAI) and narrowband interference in some weighted proportions, as well as combining multipaths simultaneously. Under some specific simplified channel models, the receiver reduces to the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, the RAKE receiver, and a notch filter. The interference rejection capability is made possible through a suitable choice of weights in the tapped delay line.

Unfortunately, the fluctuating envelopes of such systems combined with the nonlinear nature of the commonly used high power RF amplifiers gives rise to spectral spreading, adjacent channel interference, I-Q crosstalk, and degraded bit error rates. A possible solution to these problems is the linearization of the transmitter system by predistorting the baseband digital signal to compensate for amplifier nonlinearities. A neural network algorithm is used to implement a predistortion technique which takes advantage of realistic assumptions about the amplifier response. By exploiting a model of RF amplifiers based on AM-AM and AM-PM distortion functions, a neural network adaptive predistortion technique is developed which yields fewer parameters, reduced computational costs, and improved performance over other types of predistortion.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.568636","startPage":"316","endPage":"320 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12345/00568636.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.568636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predistortion of nonlinear amplifiers using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Neural networks","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Digital communication","Digital modulation","Interchannel interference","Crosstalk","Degradation","Bit error rate","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency amplifiers","neural nets","digital radio","power amplifiers","adjacent channel interference","crosstalk","adaptive signal processing","linearisation techniques","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear amplifiers","neural networks","digital radio systems","high data rate systems","predistortion","linear modulation","high power RF amplifiers","spectral spreading","adjacent channel interference","I-Q crosstalk","degraded bit error rates","transmitter system linearization","baseband digital signal","amplifier nonlinearities","neural network algorithm","amplifier response","AM-PM distortion function","AM-AM distortion function","adaptive predistortion","computational costs reduction","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Predistortion of nonlinear amplifiers using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5601808","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predistortion of nonlinear amplifiers using neural networks","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00568636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023868S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"10","articleId":"568636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":568672,"authors":[{"name":"V.

They show that temporal locality can be characterized by the marginal distribution of the stack distance trace, and propose models for typical distributions and compare their cache performance to the traces. They also show that spatial locality in a reference stream can be characterized using the notion of self-similarity. Self-similarity describes long-range correlations in the data set, which is a property that previous researchers have found hard to incorporate into synthetic reference strings. They show that stack distance strings appear to be strongly self-similar, and provide measurements of the degree of self-similarity in the traces. Finally, they discuss methods for generating synthetic Web traces that exhibit the properties of temporal and spatial locality measured in the data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12368","publicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4299/12368/00568672.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PDIS.1996.568672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDIS.1996.568672","startPage":"92","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing reference locality in the WWW","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568672/","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing reference locality in the WWW","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 1996","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5484849","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing reference locality in the WWW","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00568672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058957S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4299","citationCount":"152","articleId":"568672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568674,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It provides a 2-adic proof of a theorem of McEliece that characterizes the possible Hamming weights that can appear in a binary cyclic code. A generalization of this theorem is derived that applies to cyclic codes over Z/sub 2(a)/ that are obtained from binary cyclic codes by a sequence of Hensel lifts. This generalization characterizes the number of times a residue modulo 2/sup a/ appears as a component of an arbitrary codeword in the cyclic code. The limit of the sequence of Hensel lifts is a universal code defined over the 2-adic integers. This code was first introduced by Calderbank and Sloane (1995), and is the main subject of this paper. Binary cyclic codes and cyclic codes over Z/sub 2(a)/ are obtained from these universal codes by reduction modulo some power of 2. A special case of particular interest is cyclic codes over Z/sub 4/ that are obtained from binary cyclic codes by means of a single Hensel lift. The binary images of such codes under the Gray isometry include the Kerdock, Preparata, and Delsart-Goethals codes. These are nonlinear binary codes that contain more codewords than any linear code presently known. Fundamental understanding of the composition of codewords in cyclic codes over Z/sub 4/ is central to the search for more families of optimal codes. This paper also constructs even unimodular lattices from the Hensel lift of extended binary cyclic codes that are self-dual with all Hamming weights divisible by 4. The Leech lattice arises in this way as do extremal lattices in dimensions 32 through 48.","doi":"10.1109/18.568706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/12351/00568706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.568706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12351","startPage":"977","endPage":"986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2-adic approach to the analysis of cyclic codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 2-adic approach to the analysis of cyclic codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5574660","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2-adic approach to the analysis of cyclic codes","sourcePdf":"00568706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032943S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"21","articleId":"568706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568707,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The scheme uses an algebraic decoder to iteratively generate a sequence of candidate codewords one at a time using a set of test error patterns that are constructed based on the reliability information of the received symbols. When a candidate codeword is generated, it is tested based on an optimality condition. If it satisfies the optimality condition, then it is the most likely (ML) codeword and the decoding stops. If it fails the optimality test, a search for the ML codeword is conducted in a region which contains the ML codeword. The search region is determined by the current candidate codeword and the reliability of the received symbols. The search is conducted through a purged trellis diagram for the given code using the Viterbi algorithm. If the search fails to find the ML codeword, a new candidate is generated using a new test error pattern, and the optimality test and search are renewed. The process of testing and search continues until either the ML codeword is found or all the test error patterns are exhausted and the decoding process is terminated. Numerical results show that the proposed decoding scheme achieves either practically optimal performance or a performance only a fraction of a decibel away from the optimal maximum-likelihood decoding with a significant reduction in decoding complexity compared with the Viterbi decoding based on the full trellis diagram of the codes.","doi":"10.1109/18.568717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.568717","startPage":"1030","endPage":"1040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/12351/00568717.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-decision decoding of binary linear block codes based on an iterative search algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Soft-decision decoding of binary linear block codes based on an iterative search algorithm","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5574671","publicationDate":"May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-decision decoding of binary linear block codes based on an iterative search algorithm","sourcePdf":"00568717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059344S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","articleId":"568717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":568718,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The decoding technique is especially well suited for cosets of partial unit memory (PUM) convolutional codes. A connection between the decoder trellises for cosets of block codes and PUM codes on the 1-D PRC is exploited to obtain a small number of operations per decoded information bit. We prove that the new decoding technique needs fewer operations than the Viterbi algorithm for any (n,n-r), r/spl ges/1, PUM code coset with n/spl les/2/sup v-r/ where v is the constraint length. It is also indicated how to prove the same result for other classes of codes.

In a multilevel diversity coding system, an information source is encoded by a number of encoders.

The reconstructions of the source by decoders within the same level are identical and are subject to the same distortion criterion. Inspired by applications in computer communication and fault-tolerant data retrieval, we study a multilevel diversity coding problem with three levels for which the connectivity between the encoders and decoders is symmetrical.

The proposed model focuses on dimensionality reduction of the mel-warped discrete Fourier transform (DFT) feature space subject to maximal preservation of speech classification information, and aims at finding an optimal linear transformation on the mel-warped DFT according to the minimum classification error (MCE) criterion. This linear transformation, along with the HMM parameters, are automatically trained using the gradient descent method to minimize a measure of overall empirical error counts. A further generalization of the model allows integration of the discriminatively derived state-dependent transformation with the construction of dynamic feature parameters. Experimental results show that state-dependent transformation on mel-warped DFT features is superior in performance to the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC's).

We argue that traditional methods relying on distribution estimation are suboptimal when the assumed distribution form is not the true one, and that \"optimality\" in distribution estimation does not automatically translate into \"optimality\" in classifier design. We compare the two different methods in the context of hidden Markov modeling for speech recognition. We show the superiority of the minimum classification error (MCE) method over the distribution estimation method by providing the results of several key speech recognition experiments. In general, the MCE method provides a significant reduction of recognition error rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5564346","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minimum classification error rate methods for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum classification error rate methods for speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00568732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039043S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"402","articleId":"568732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568733,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

It involves the recognition of keyword strings and the rejection of nonkeyword strings. This paper describes a hidden Markov model-based (HMM-based) utterance verification system using the framework of statistical hypothesis testing. The two major issues on how to design keyword and string scoring criteria are addressed. For keyword verification, different alternative hypotheses are proposed based on the scores of antikeyword models and a general acoustic filler model. For string verification, different measures are proposed with the objective of detecting nonvocabulary word strings and possibly erroneous strings (so-called putative errors). This paper also motivates the need for discriminative hypothesis testing in verification. One such approach based on minimum classification error training is investigated in detail. When the proposed verification technique was integrated into a state-of-the-art connected digit recognition system, the string error rate for valid digit strings was found to decrease by 57% when setting the rejection rate to 5%. Furthermore, the system was able to correctly reject over 99.9% of nonvocabulary word strings.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568733","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Acoustic testing","Acoustic signal detection","Telephony","System testing","Acoustic measurements","Error analysis","Vocabulary","Event detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","hidden Markov models","error statistics","statistical analysis","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical hypothesis testing","discriminative utterance verification","connected digits recognition","user-friendly speech recognition systems","keyword strings recognition","nonkeyword strings rejection","hidden Markov model","HMM utterance verification system","string scoring criteria","keyword verification","antikeyword models","general acoustic filler model","nonvocabulary word strings","erroneous strings","putative errors","discriminative hypothesis testing","minimum classification error training","string error rate","rejection rate"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/12354/00568733.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.568733","doi":"10.1109/89.568733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative utterance verification for connected digits recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568733/","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative utterance verification for connected digits recognition","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5557381","volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative utterance verification for connected digits recognition","sourcePdf":"00568733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053271S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"79","articleId":"568733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":568735,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These procedures indicate to the human operator (in this case the pilot) the manner in which operational management intends to have various tasks done. The intent is to provide guidance to the pilots and to ensure a safe, logical, efficient, and predictable (standardized) means of carrying out the objectives of the job. However, procedures can become a hodge-podge. Inconsistent or illogical procedures may lead to noncompliance by operators. Based on a field study with three major airlines, the authors propose a model for procedure development called the \"Four P's\": philosophy, policies, procedures, and practices. Using this model as a framework, the authors discuss the intricate issue of designing flight-deck procedures, and propose a conceptual approach for designing any set of procedures. The various factors, both external and internal to the cockpit, that must be considered for procedure design are presented. In particular, the paper addresses the development of procedures for automated cockpits-a decade-long, and highly controversial issue in commercial aviation. Although this paper is based on airline operations, we assume that the principles discussed here are also applicable to other high-risk supervisory control systems, such as space flight, manufacturing process control, nuclear power production, and military operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5561162","pubMedId":"11541101","displayDocTitle":"Procedures in complex systems: the airline cockpit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Procedures in complex systems: the airline cockpit","sourcePdf":"00568739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024812S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"180","articleId":"568739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":568750,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This effect has the largest impact precisely in the roll-off region of the mobility curves, which has been the subject of recent theoretical investigations.","doi":"10.1109/55.568778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","startPage":"235","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/12356/00568778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.568778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electron mobility in ULSI MOSFETs: effect of interface traps and oxide nitridation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron mobility","Ultra large scale integration","MOSFET circuits","Electron traps","Doping","Capacitance","Degradation","Furnaces","Rapid thermal processing","Electrical resistance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ULSI","MOSFET","electron mobility","Fermi level","capacitance","nitridation","interface states","electron traps","hole traps","heavily doped semiconductors","MOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","semiconductor device reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ULSI MOSFET","interface traps","oxide nitridation","electron mobility measurements","N/sub 2/O-nitrided MOSFET","channel doping","heavily-doped devices","Fermi level","conduction band edge","gate-channel capacitance","channel charge","mobility curves","rolloff region","77 to 300 K","N/sub 2/O"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Electron mobility in ULSI MOSFETs: effect of interface traps and oxide nitridation","volume":"18","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5574837","publicationDate":"May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568778/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electron mobility in ULSI MOSFETs: effect of interface traps and oxide nitridation","sourcePdf":"00568778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044225S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"11","articleId":"568778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":568799,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The key results obtained are as follows. 1) For formation of a MOSFET shallow junction, which suppresses threshold voltage (V/sub T/) variation and offset voltage of sense amplifiers, reduction in ion-implantation energy and process temperature is essential. Also, the keys in terms of area, speed, stable cell operation, and ease of fabrication are use of low-resistivity multilevel metal wiring and high permittivity materials and three-dimensional memory cells to reduce a difference in height between the memory cell array and the surrounding peripheral circuits. 2) For creation of a high speed, the keys are memory-subsystem technology such as pipeline operation, wide-bit I/O, low-voltage interfaces, and high-density packaging. Embedded DRAM further enhances the speed and throughput by using massively parallel processing of signals on a large number of data-lines and reducing internal bus capacitances. 3) For power reduction, the key continues to be reduction of the data-line dissipating charge through both partial activation of multidivided data-lines and lowering of the data-line voltage. Ultralow-voltage operation, essential to drastic power reduction, can be achieved by subthreshold-current reduction circuits such as source-gate backbiasing, multi-V/sub T/, dynamic V/sub T/, and node-boosting schemes.","doi":"10.1109/4.568820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/12357/00568820.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.568820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations and challenges of multigigabit DRAM chip design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Limitations and challenges of multigigabit DRAM chip design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568820/","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5580333","volume":"32","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations and challenges of multigigabit DRAM chip design","sourcePdf":"00568820.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056231S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"58","articleId":"568820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":568822,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In this architecture, to read the data of only one memory cell destructively, the precharge level of the selected subdataline is modified by charge-sharing between the subdataline and main dataline. This architecture enables high-speed read operations, because the operations of modifying the precharge level and reading the data of memory cells are achieved simultaneously. Three circuit technologies are used in the CSM architecture to increase the operating margin: self-timing precharge circuits which solve the polarization disturbance problem without adding extra signal lines or timing margins, a boosted precharge level technique which increases the signal voltage of the nonvolatile data, and shared dummy cell circuits which improve the precision of the reference voltage over that of a conventional voltage generator. These techniques and circuits are evaluated for a simulated 16-Mb ferroelectric memory. They reduce the access time by 20 ns to 51 ns compared with the conventional architecture, while reducing the memory array current to less than 1% that of the all-subdataline activation technology.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/12357/00568827.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The charge-share modified (CSM) precharge-level architecture for high-speed and low-power ferroelectric memory","doi":"10.1109/4.568827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.568827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568827/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"The charge-share modified (CSM) precharge-level architecture for high-speed and low-power ferroelectric memory","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5580336","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The charge-share modified (CSM) precharge-level architecture for high-speed and low-power ferroelectric memory","sourcePdf":"00568827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035018S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"1","articleId":"568827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568829,"authors":[{"name":"T.

From the basis of a transconductor design, an asynchronous comparator and a video bandwidth op amp are also developed, providing a family of general purpose analog circuit functions which may be used in high (and low) bandwidth mixed-signal systems. Benefits for the system designer are that the need for rigorous control of common-mode levels is avoided and input signal swings right across the power supply range can be easily handled. A further benefit is that having very consistent performance, the circuits can be easily described in VHDL (or other behavioral language) to allow simulation of large mixed-signal systems. The circuits presented may be easily adapted for a range of requirements.

Since domino logic is inherently noninverting, it presents a fundamental constraint of implementing logic functions without any intermediate inversions. Removal of intermediate inverters requires logic duplication for generating both the negative and positive signal phases, which results in significant area overhead. This area overhead can be substantially reduced by selecting an optimal output phase assignment, which results in a minimum logic duplication penalty for obtaining inverter-free logic. In this paper, we present this previously unaddressed problem of output phase assignment for minimum area duplication in dynamic logic synthesis. We give both optimal and heuristic algorithms for minimizing logic duplication.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4215/12302/00568901.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1996.568901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1996.568901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12302","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic optimization by output phase assignment in dynamic logic synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse inverters","CMOS logic circuits","Logic design","Logic gates","Logic functions","Clocks","Signal generators","Network synthesis","Process design","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","minimisation of switching nets","circuit optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic optimization","output phase assignment","dynamic logic synthesis","domino logic","logic functions","inverters","logic duplication","area overhead","minimum logic duplication penalty","heuristic algorithms","optimal algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Logic optimization by output phase assignment in dynamic logic synthesis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465389","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic optimization by output phase assignment in dynamic logic synthesis","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00568901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036718S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4215","citationCount":"37","articleId":"568901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":568903,"authors":[{"name":"Juinn-Dar Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Juinn-Dar Huang","id":"37293535900"},{"name":"Jing-Yang Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jing-Yang Jou","id":"37274764900"},{"name":"Wen-Zen Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Zen Shen","id":"37335137000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7597-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"568903","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Circuits","Sorting","Performance evaluation","Table lookup","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","table lookup","logic CAD","circuit optimisation","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative area","performance trade-off algorithm","LUT-based FPGA technology mapping","area-optimized performance-considered initial network","modified area optimization technique","iterative algorithm","mapping solutions","timing driven FPGA synthesis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an iterative area/performance trade-off algorithm for LUT-based FPGA technology mapping.

However, for typical RLC interconnections with ramp input, Elmore delay can deviate by up to 100% or more from SPICE-computed delay since it is independent of rise time of the input ramp signal. We develop new analytical delay models based on the first and second moments of the interconnect transfer function when the input is a ramp signal with finite rise time. Delay estimates using our first moment based analytical models are within 4% of SPICE-computed delay, and models based on both first and second moments are within 2.3% of SPICE, across a wide range of interconnect parameter values. Evaluation of our analytical models is several orders of magnitude faster than simulation using SPICE. We also describe extensions of our approach for estimation of source-sink delays in arbitrary interconnect trees.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1996.568907","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4215/12302/00568907.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1996.568907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical delay models for VLSI interconnects under ramp input","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Analytical delay models for VLSI interconnects under ramp input","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465394","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical delay models for VLSI interconnects under ramp input","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00568907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052535S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4215","citationCount":"44","articleId":"568907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":568915,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

In multiunit recordings, superpositions can occur with high frequency if the firing rates of the neurons are high or correlated, making superposition resolution imperative for accurate spike train determination. In this work, a connectionist neural network (NN) was applied to the spike sorting challenge. A novel training scheme was developed which enabled the NN to resolve some superpositions using single-channel recordings. Simulated multiunit spike trains were constructed from templates and noise segments that were extracted from real extracellular recordings. The simulations were used to determine the performances of the NN and a simple matched template filter (MTF), which was used as a basis for comparison. The network performed as well as the MTF in identifying nonoverlapping spikes, and was significantly better in resolving superpositions and rejecting noise. An on-line, real-time implementation of the NN discriminator, using a high-speed digital signal processor mounted inside an IBM-PC, is now in use in six laboratories.","doi":"10.1109/10.568916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/12376/00568916.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.568916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection, classification, and superposition resolution of action potentials in multiunit single-channel recordings by an on-line real-time neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568916/","displayDocTitle":"Detection, classification, and superposition resolution of action potentials in multiunit single-channel recordings by an on-line real-time neural network","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5580389","pubMedId":"9125825","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection, classification, and superposition resolution of action potentials in multiunit single-channel recordings by an on-line real-time neural network","sourcePdf":"00568916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043986S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"92","articleId":"568916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568919,"authors":[{"name":"W.G.

It describes an algorithm for image segmentation at multiple scales. The detected regions are homogeneous and surrounded by closed edge contours. Previous approaches to multiscale segmentation represent an image at different scales using a scale-space. However, structure is only represented implicitly in this representation, structures at coarser scales are inherently smoothed, and the problem of structure extraction is unaddressed. This paper argues that the issues of scale selection and structure detection cannot be treated separately. A new concept of scale is presented that represents image structures at different scales, and not the image itself. This scale is integrated into a nonlinear transform which makes structure explicit in the transformed domain. Structures that are stable (locally invariant) to changes in scale are identified as being perceptually relevant. The transform can be viewed as collecting spatially distributed evidence for edges and regions, and making it available at contour locations, thereby facilitating integrated detection of edges and regions without restrictive models of geometry or homogeneity. In this sense, it performs Gestalt analysis. All scale parameters of the transform are automatically determined, and the structure of any arbitrary geometry can be identified without any smoothing, even at coarse scales.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.568922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12377","startPage":"642","endPage":"655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/12377/00568922.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale image segmentation by integrated edge and region detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiscale image segmentation by integrated edge and region detection","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5576094","pubMedId":"18282958","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale image segmentation by integrated edge and region detection","sourcePdf":"00568922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035163S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"130","articleId":"568922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":568923,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Xiaolin Wu","id":"37087144391"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"568923","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":166,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":588},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Quantization","Context modeling","Predictive models","State estimation","Computational efficiency","Probability","Pulse modulation","Predictive coding","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","quantisation (signal)","data compression","differential pulse code modulation","coding errors","source coding","Markov processes","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossless compression","continuous-tone images","context selection","context quantization","algorithm design","context modeling","high-order Markovian modeling","context dilution","conditional probabilities","lossless image coder","context-dependent DPCM error structures","compression performance","source coding","predictive coding","entropy coding"]}],"abstract":"Context modeling is an extensively studied paradigm for lossless compression of continuous-tone images. However, without careful algorithm design, high-order Markovian modeling of continuous-tone images is too expensive in both computational time and space to be practical. Furthermore, the exponential growth of the number of modeling states in the order of a Markov model can quickly lead to the problem of context dilution; that is, an image may not have enough samples for good estimates of conditional probabilities associated with the modeling states. New techniques for context modeling of DPCM errors are introduced that can exploit context-dependent DPCM error structures to the benefit of compression. New algorithmic techniques of forming and quantizing modeling contexts are also developed to alleviate the problem of context dilution and reduce both time and space complexities. By innovative formation, quantization, and use of modeling contexts, the proposed lossless image coder has a highly competitive compression performance and yet remains practical.","doi":"10.1109/83.568923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/12377/00568923.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.568923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12377","startPage":"656","endPage":"664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless compression of continuous-tone images via context selection, quantization, and modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lossless compression of continuous-tone images via context selection, quantization, and modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5576095","pubMedId":"18282959","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless compression of continuous-tone images via context selection, quantization, and modeling","sourcePdf":"00568923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047116S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"166","articleId":"568923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568924,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Adaptivity is useful in applications, including image compression, where the statistics of the source are either not known a priori or will change over time. Our algorithm uses previously quantized samples to estimate the distribution of the source, and does not require that side information be sent in order to adapt to changing source statistics. Our quantization scheme is thus backward adaptive. We propose that an adaptive quantizer can be separated into two building blocks, namely, model estimation and quantizer design. The model estimation produces an estimate of the changing source probability density function, which is then used to redesign the quantizer using standard techniques. We introduce nonparametric estimation techniques that only assume smoothness of the input distribution. We discuss the various sources of error in our estimation and argue that, for a wide class of sources with a smooth probability density function (pdf), we provide a good approximation to a \"universal\" quantizer, with the approximation becoming better as the rate increases. We study the performance of our scheme and show how the loss due to adaptivity is minimal in typical scenarios. In particular, we provide examples and show how our technique can achieve signal-to-noise ratios within 0.05 dB of the optimal Lloyd-Max quantizer for a memoryless source, while achieving over 1.5 dB gain over a fixed quantizer for a bimodal source.","doi":"10.1109/83.568924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"665","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.568924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12377","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/12377/00568924.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Image coding","Statistical distributions","Probability density function","Huffman coding","Pulse modulation","Estimation error","Performance loss","Gain","Data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","adaptive codes","error analysis","nonparametric statistics","estimation theory","probability","memoryless systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive scalar quantization","side information","image compression","source statistics","model estimation","quantizer design","changing source probability density function","nonparametric estimation techniques","smoothness","input distribution","error","universal quantizer","signal-to-noise ratio","optimal Lloyd-Max quantizer","memoryless source","bimodal source","fixed quantizer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive scalar quantization without side information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568924/","volume":"6","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5576096","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18282960","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive scalar quantization without side information","sourcePdf":"00568924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0557S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"45","articleId":"568924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":568925,"authors":[{"name":"Zixiang Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Zixiang Xiong","id":"37087001142"},{"name":"K.

The algorithm uses higher order spectra to provide desirable invariance properties, to provide noise immunity, and to incorporate nonlinearity into the feature extraction procedure thereby allowing the use of simple classifiers. An image can be reduced to a set of 1D functions via the Radon transform, or alternatively, the Fourier transform of each 1D projection can be obtained from a radial slice of the 2D Fourier transform of the image according to the Fourier slice theorem. A triple product of Fourier coefficients, referred to as the deterministic bispectrum, is computed for each 1D function and is integrated along radial lines in bifrequency space. Phases of the integrated bispectra are shown to be translation- and scale-invariant. Rotation invariance is achieved by a regrouping of these invariants at a constant radius followed by a second stage of invariant extraction. Rotation invariance is thus converted to translation invariance in the second step. Results using synthetic and actual images show that isolated, compact clusters are formed in feature space. These clusters are linearly separable, indicating that the nonlinearity required in the mapping from the input space to the classification space is incorporated well into the feature extraction stage. The use of higher order spectra results in good noise immunity, as verified with synthetic and real images. Classification of images using the higher order spectra-based algorithm compares favorably to classification using the method of moment invariants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5576099","pubMedId":"18282963","displayDocTitle":"Pattern recognition using invariants defined from higher order spectra: 2-D image inputs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern recognition using invariants defined from higher order spectra: 2-D image inputs","sourcePdf":"00568927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045497S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"79","articleId":"568927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":568929,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The filterbank implementation of the wavelet transform acts as a hierarchy of such detectors operating at discrete object scales. If the object to be detected is Gaussian and its scale happens to coincide with one of those computed by the wavelet transform, and if the background noise is truly Markov, then optimum detection is realized by thresholding the appropriate subband image. In reality, the Gaussian may be a rather coarse approximation of the object, and the background noise may deviate from the Markov assumption. In this case, we may view the wavelet decomposition as a means for computing an orthogonal feature set for input to a classifier. We use a supervised linear classifier applied to feature vectors comprised of samples taken from the subbands of an N-octave, undecimated wavelet transform. The resulting map of test statistic values indicates the presence and location of objects. The object itself is reconstructed by using the test statistic to emphasize wavelet subbands, followed by computing the inverse wavelet transform. We show two contrasting applications of the wavelets-based object recovery algorithm. For detecting microcalcifications in digitized mammograms, the object and noise models closely match the real image data, and the multiscale matched filter paradigm is highly appropriate. The second application, extracting ship outlines in noisy forward-looking infrared images, is presented as a case where good results are achieved despite the data models being less well matched to the assumptions of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/83.568929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/12377/00568929.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.568929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12377","startPage":"724","endPage":"735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transform methods for object detection and recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transform methods for object detection and recovery","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568929/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5576101","pubMedId":"18282965","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transform methods for object detection and recovery","sourcePdf":"00568929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046228S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"93","articleId":"568929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":568933,"authors":[{"name":"Yui-Lam Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yui-Lam Chan","id":"37087160044"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wan-Chi Siu","id":"37087074346"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"568933","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":139},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional discrete cosine transform (3-D DCT) coding has the advantage of reducing the interframe redundancy among a number of consecutive frames, while the motion compensation technique can only reduce the redundancy of at most two frames.

This paper presents a 3-D DCT coding with a variable temporal length that is determined by the scene change detector. Our idea is to let the motion activity in each block be very low, while the efficiency of the 3-D DCT coding could be increased.

The unique contribution of our algorithm is that it performs Steiner tree construction buffer insertion, and wire sizing simultaneously with consideration of both critical delay and total capacitance minimization by combining the performance-driven A-tree construction and dynamic programming based buffer insertion and wire sizing, while tree construction and the other delay minimization techniques were carried out independently in the past.

One problem for the autonomous system is to plan a path to the goal. A usual method uses potential fields to find a global path. With this method, obstacles must be clearly defined. But this is not the case in such natural environments. A new physically based potential method is introduced to find paths such as, for instance, a winding path to a pass. Moreover, locally, vehicles have to cope with a geometrically unstable environment and thus have a complex dynamic behavior. Thus it is necessary to elaborate a physical model of the robot-environment system. Generally, the two plannings, global and local, are independent. The introduced potential method resorts to the simulations of the vehicles to find a feasible path.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1996.568960","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

In this paper we present a control method in which the real joint actuators are used to mimic virtual actuators which can be more intuitive and hence make the control problem more straightforward. Our virtual actuator control method requires a solution to the force distribution problem when applied to parallel mechanisms. An extension of Gardner's partitioned actuator set control method (1991) is presented. This extended method allows for dealing with constrained degrees of freedom in which the torque cannot be specified but can be measured. A simulated hexapod robot was developed to test the proposed control method. The virtual actuators allowed textbook control solutions to be used in controlling this highly nonlinear, parallel mechanism. Using a simple linear control law, the robot walked while simultaneously balancing a pendulum and tracking an object.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/568974/","accessionNumber":"5514182","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-8 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Virtual actuator control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual actuator control","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00568974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032455S","chronDate":"4-8 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4292","citationCount":"29","articleId":"568974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":569008,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Velocity-hydrophone technology is well-established in the field of underwater acoustics and its inherent directionality allows it to measure separately the three Cartesian components of the incident sonar velocity-field. In one particular scenario with two closely spaced uncorrelated narrowband sources, the proposed algorithm offers a 67% savings in hydrophone hardware and 56% savings in computational costs over an array of spatially displaced pressure-hydrophones producing the same estimation performance. In another scenario where the hardware and computational costs are comparable between the proposed algorithm and the customary array of spatially displaced pressure-hydrophones, the proposed algorithm offers a 10 dB SNR advantage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5533878","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal velocity-hydrophone ESPRIT for sonar source localization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal velocity-hydrophone ESPRIT for sonar source localization","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00569092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045922S","chronDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4196","citationCount":"25","articleId":"569092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":569095,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An algorithm which registers directly all these images would be very complex and hardly evolutive. In order to overcome these problems, the authors propose a two-step registrating system: its first stage is acquisition-dependent and extracts information through processed tailored for each sonar type. Then, this symbolic knowledge feeds a generic system whose goal is to perform the matching task between current information and previously recorded data. Examples of such data range from coarse detected objects (low resolution sensor) to finely delimited homogeneous sea-bed regions (texture analysis relying on higher resolution sonar outputs). Thus, multiple symbolic information can be extracted from the same sea-bed region when various tracks overlap. Nevertheless, precision on tow-fish navigational data recorded with sonar images, do not allow one to directly match common information. Thus, the authors implement such a matching mechanism using genetic algorithms with variable-length chromosomes coding a field of transformations the size of which is not a priori known. This new flexibility allows the registration of different tracks covering a same sea-bed region with multiple distortions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569095/","accessionNumber":"5533881","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sonar image registration through symbolic matching: a fuzzy local transform approach using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sonar image registration through symbolic matching: a fuzzy local transform approach using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00569095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055846S","chronDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4196","citationCount":"7","articleId":"569095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":569118,"authors":[{"name":"K.T.

Each velocity-hydrophone measures one Cartesian component of the sonar velocity-field. The use of such velocity-hydrophone triads enable the measurement of the velocity-field vector of the sonar wavefield. Each source's normalized velocity-field vector is equal to the source's Cartesian direction-cosines. The source's arrival angle can thus be extracted from the velocity-field measurements. On the other hand, when uniformly spaced array elements are spaced beyond a half wavelength, ESPRIT's eigenvalues offer a cyclic ambiguity. The direction-cosine estimates obtained from the velocity-field may serve as reference to clarify the low-variance but cyclically ambiguous direction-cosine estimation obtained from ESPRIT's eigenvalues. Simulations are presented showing the sample variance of direction-cosine estimates decreasing linearly as inter-triad spacing is increased from a half-wavelength to 12 half-wavelengths, with a 33-fold reduction in estimation standard deviation relative to the half-wavelength case. This proposed scheme also outperforms a uniform half-wavelength-spaced array of pressure-hydrophones with comparable hardware and software costs by an order of magnitude in estimation standard deviation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569118/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5533903","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ESPRIT-based extended-aperture source localization using velocity-hydrophones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ESPRIT-based extended-aperture source localization using velocity-hydrophones","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00569118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057756S","chronDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4196","citationCount":"23","articleId":"569118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":569134,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In (0), the algorithm detects the critical paths based on their lower bounds of delays. The delays of the critical paths are reduced with higher priority. In (1), the algorithm attempts to assign the primary input and output on each critical path to one chip. In (2), the algorithm not only decreases the number of crossings between chips but also assigns the logic blocks on each critical path to one chip by exploiting a network flow technique with logic-block replication.

Also the measured results on the simple Chinese word speech classification have successfully verified the function correctness and performance of the designed neural network.","doi":"10.1109/APCAS.1996.569292","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'96 - Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAS.1996.569292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12364","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'96 - Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4295/12364/00569292.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse-width-modulation feedforward neural network design with on-chip learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569292/","displayDocTitle":"Pulse-width-modulation feedforward neural network design with on-chip learning","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5572068","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse-width-modulation feedforward neural network design with on-chip learning","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00569292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041331S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4295","articleId":"569292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":569302,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Myun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung Myun Kim","id":"37087429689"},{"name":"Kwang Sub Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwang Sub Yoon","id":"37087150170"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3702-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"569302","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","CMOS technology","Signal processing","Delay effects","Error correction","Power dissipation","Voltage","Digital circuits","Circuit simulation","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","interpolation","analogue-digital conversion","error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS current-mode ADC","folding A/D converter","interpolation A/D converter","three-level folding amplifiers","delay time error correction circuit","coarse quantizer","fine quantizer","8 bit","1.5 micron","30 mW","5 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569302","doi":"10.1109/APCAS.1996.569302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAS.1996.569302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12364","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'96 - Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'96 - Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4295/12364/00569302.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 8-bit CMOS current-mode folding and interpolation A/D converter with three-level folding amplifiers","abstract":"This paper describes an 8-bit CMOS current-mode folding and interpolation A/D converter (ADC) with three-level folding amplifiers.

An MCM packaging scheme based on area-distributed I/O pads serves as the foundation of the PUMA project at the University of Michigan. Area interconnect facilitates high I/O counts, shorter interconnect routes, smaller power rails, and better thermal conductivity, all of which are important in high clock-rate digital systems. This paper introduces recently developed CAD tools that aid in the design of flip-chip area-interconnected integrated circuits. The tools permit the designer to place and route area bond pads as dictated by the layout of the microprocessor. System level issues, such as adequate power distribution and placement of area pad buffers, are addressed.

The D/A-converter is a binary weighted current-switching converter with 8-bit resolution. The uni-directional D/A-output currents are converted to bi-directional input currents for a differential current-mode 1 MHz low-pass filter by a common-mode feedforward circuit. The smoothing filter and current gain amplifier use high-gain current amplifiers using dynamically biased low distortion transconductance output stage. The filtered and amplified current is then fed to a current-switching mixer with off-chip loads. The filter operates with down to a 3 V supply voltage while the D/A-converter can operate even with 2.5 V supply. The harmonic distortion of the filter is typically lower than -50 dBc and thus more than 8-bit spurious free range can be achieved by oversampling.","doi":"10.1109/AMICD.1996.569374","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE-CAS Region 8 Workshop on Analog and Mixed IC Design.

ATM switches are one critical component of this resource allocation scheme. They decide, based on the users present on the system and their required QoS and a new call request and its QoS, whether to add the new call. This requires prediction of the QoS parameters if the new user is added. Since networks operate at such high speeds, call admission decisions must be made quickly, yet the prediction function may be complicated. These conditions are ripe for application of a neural network. QoS requirements are typically specified in term of cell delay and cell loss. Previous attempts to estimate the cell delay have either used training methods which produce a single percentile value or have estimated unconditional distributions. We propose a more natural method which admits greater flexibility in specification of user's QoS requirements and accounts for conditioned variables. We present a conditional cumulative distribution estimating neural network. We then estimate the cumulative distribution of cell delay conditioned on the number of users in a typical ATM switch model and discuss the merits of our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569405/","accessionNumber":"5601850","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Quality of service prediction using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of service prediction using neural networks","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00569405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029772S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"2","articleId":"569405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":569413,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

A constrained SGD algorithm is proposed to adaptively adjust the filter parameter by minimizing a properly chosen cost function while satisfying a set of constraints. The algorithm incorporates some a priori knowledge of the desired signal for filter adaptation instead of a training sequence. The algorithm improves the steady state performance by jointly estimating the reference parameter as well as the filter parameters. An iterative maximum likelihood absolute mean estimation algorithm is devised to estimate the reference parameter. The sequential EM algorithm is used to monotonically decrease the cost function. For each input, the algorithm updates the parameters by iterating between estimating the cost function (E step), and minimizing the cost function with respect to each unknown parameter (M step). In the M step of the filter update algorithm, a set of constraints is applied to guarantee convergence. Thus, the algorithm asymptotically converges to the constrained optimum solution. The proposed algorithm is tested by computer simulations and is shown to significantly improve the steady state performance compared to the existing adaptive algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12335/00569413.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"596 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.569413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.569413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constrained adaptive algorithm for multiple access interference suppression in DS/CDMA communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference constraints","Adaptive algorithm","Multiple access interference","Iterative algorithms","Filters","Cost function","Steady-state","Parameter estimation","Interference suppression","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","adaptive estimation","adaptive filters","maximum likelihood estimation","iterative methods","sequential estimation","convergence of numerical methods","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained adaptive algorithm","multiple access interference suppression","DS/CDMA communication systems","constrained SGD algorithm","filter parameter","cost function","filter adaptation","training sequence","steady state performance","reference parameter estimation","filter parameters","iterative maximum likelihood absolute mean estimation algorithm","sequential EM algorithm","convergence","constrained optimum solution","computer simulations","stochastic gradient descent"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A constrained adaptive algorithm for multiple access interference suppression in DS/CDMA communication systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5601855","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constrained adaptive algorithm for multiple access interference suppression in DS/CDMA communication systems","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00569413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040737S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"1","articleId":"569413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":569419,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

This work supports an upcoming experiment in which channel estimates obtained with one modulation scheme will be used to predict the performance of higher order modulation schemes. The focus of this paper is the mathematical framework for the theoretical performance prediction. Linear memoryless modulation is assumed, providing a a very general signal model that includes M-PSK and M-QAM. The channel model is slowly fading, with correlated complex Gaussian taps, incorporating both the flat and frequency selective cases. Expressions for the error probability are presented, and the cases for which closed form or acceptable numerical solutions exist are delineated. A new recursive method for solving the Rician-fading main path case is presented. The high-data-rate maritime line-of-sight channel is used to demonstrate the use fullness of the method.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.569419","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12335/00569419.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.569419","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"612","endPage":"617 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimate-based performance prediction for coherent linear modulation on slowly fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimate-based performance prediction for coherent linear modulation on slowly fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569419/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5608988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimate-based performance prediction for coherent linear modulation on slowly fading channels","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00569419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032723S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"7","articleId":"569419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":569421,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Zoltowski","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Zoltowski","id":"37278519000"},{"name":"Yung-Fang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Yung-Fang Chen","id":"37367661300"},{"name":"J.

This class of algorithms is of the \"local improvement\" type. They generate relatively high quality results for small and medium size circuits. However, as VLSI circuits become larger, these algorithms are not so effective on them as direct partitioning tools. We propose new iterative-improvement methods that select cells to move with a view to moving clusters that straddle the two subsets of a partition into one of the subsets. The new algorithms significantly improve partition quality while preserving the advantage of time efficiency. Experimental results on 25 medium to large size ACM/SIGDA benchmark circuits show up to 70% improvement over FM in cutsize, with an average of per-circuit percent improvements of about 25%, and a total cut improvement of about 35%. They also outperform the recent placement-based partitioning tool Paraboli and the spectral partitioner MELO by about 17% and 23%, respectively, with less CPU time. This demonstrates the potential of iterative improvement algorithms in dealing with the increasing complexity of modern VLSI circuitry.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4215/12302/00569591.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12302","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI circuit partitioning by cluster-removal using iterative improvement techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Partitioning algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Iterative methods","Central Processing Unit","Logic design","Modems","Integrated circuit interconnections","Pins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit testing","computational complexity","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI circuit partitioning","cluster-removal","iterative improvement techniques","Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm","look-ahead algorithm","CAD","partition quality","ACM/SIGDA benchmark circuits","spectral partitioner MELO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"VLSI circuit partitioning by cluster-removal using iterative improvement techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465419","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI circuit partitioning by cluster-removal using iterative improvement techniques","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00569591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037651S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4215","citationCount":"54","articleId":"569591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":569607,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Analyzing conflicts to determine their causes enables GRASP to backtrack non-chronologically to earlier levels in the search tree, potentially pruning large portions of the search spare. In addition, by \"recording\" the causes of conflicts, GRASP can recognize and preempt the occurrence of similar conflicts later on in the search. Finally straightforward bookkeeping of the causality chains leading up to conflicts allows GRASP to identify assignments that are necessary for a solution to be found.

This paper presents the first detailed analysis of the impact of such processors on shared-memory multiprocessors using a detailed execution-driven simulator. Using this analysis, we also examine the validity of common direct-execution simulation techniques that employ previous-generation processor models to approximate ILP-based multiprocessors. We find that ILP techniques substantially reduce CPU time in multiprocessors, but are less effective in reducing memory stall time. Consequently, despite the presence of inherent latency-tolerating techniques in ILP processors, memory stall time becomes a larger component of execution time and parallel efficiencies are generally poorer in ILP-based multiprocessors than in previous-generation multiprocessors. Examining the validity of direct-execution simulators with previous-generation processor models, we find that, with appropriate approximations, such simulators can reasonably characterize the behavior of applications with poor overlap of read misses. However, they can be highly inaccurate for applications with high overlap of read misses. For our applications, the errors in execution time with these simulators range from 26% to 192% for the most commonly used model, and from -8% to 73% for the most accurate model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of instruction-level parallelism on multiprocessor performance and simulation methodology","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1997.569611","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4300/12370/00569611.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1997.569611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12370","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"The impact of instruction-level parallelism on multiprocessor performance and simulation methodology","conferenceDate":"1-5 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5508101","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of instruction-level parallelism on multiprocessor performance and simulation methodology","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00569611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047841S","chronDate":"1-5 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300","citationCount":"34","articleId":"569611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":569635,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The boolean optimization is achieved by adding and removing redundant wires in a circuit. Our algorithm applies the reasoning of Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) which can detect redundancy efficiently. During the ATPG process, mandatory assignments are assignments which must be satisfied. Our algorithm analyzes different characteristics of mandatory assignments during the ATPG process. New theoretical results based on the analysis are presented which lead to significant performance improvements. The fast run time and the excellent scaling to large problems make our Boolean optimization method practical for industrial applications. Experiments show that the optimization results are comparable to those of Kunz and Pradhan (1994) while the run time is two orders of magnitude faster (average 126/spl times/ speed up). Furthermore, we report optimization results for several large examples, which were previously thought to be too large to be handled by Boolean optimization methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569641","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4215/12302/00569641.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Boolean optimization by rewiring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569641/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Boolean optimization by rewiring","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465428","conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Boolean optimization by rewiring","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00569641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060718S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4215","citationCount":"30","articleId":"569641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":569650,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Two possible solutions to this problem are to add a very large cache called remote cache that caches remote data (NUMA-RC), or organize the machine as a cache-only memory architecture (COMA). This paper tries to determine which solution is best. To compare the performance of the two organizations for the same amount of total memory, we introduce a model of data sharing. The model uses three data sharing patterns: replication, read-mostly migration, and read-writs migration. Replication data is accessed in read-mostly mode by several processors, while migration data is accessed largely by one processor at a time. For large working sets, the weight of the migration data largely determines whether COMA outperforms NUMA-RC. Ideally, COMA only needs to fit the replication data in its extra memory; the migration data will simply be swapped between attraction memories. The remote cache of NUMA-RC, instead, needs to house both the replication and the migration data. However, simulations of seven Splash2 applications show that COMA does not outperform NUMA-RC. This is due to two reasons. First, the extra memory added has more associativity in NUMA-RC than in COMA and, therefore, can be utilized better by the working set in NUMA-RC. Second, COMA memory accesses are more expensive. Of course, our results are affected by the applications used, which have been optimized for a cache-coherent NUMA machine. Overall, since NUMA-RC is cheaper, NUMA-RC is more cost-effective for these applications.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1997.569686","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4300/12370/00569686.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1997.569686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12370","startPage":"272","endPage":"281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing remote conflict misses: NUMA with remote cache versus COMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing remote conflict misses: NUMA with remote cache versus COMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569686/","conferenceDate":"1-5 Feb. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5514279","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing remote conflict misses: NUMA with remote cache versus COMA","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00569686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063743S","chronDate":"1-5 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300","citationCount":"20","articleId":"569686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":569697,"authors":[{"name":"M.

U-Net provides protected, user-level access to the network interface and offers application-level round-trip latencies as low as 60 /spl mu/sec over Fast Ethernet and 90 /spl mu/sec over ATM. The design of the network interface and the underlying network fabric have a large bearing on the U-Net design and performance. Network interfaces with programmable co-processors can transfer data directly to and from user space while others require aid from the operating system kernel. The paper provides detailed performance analysis of U-Net for Fast Ethernet and ATM, including application-level performance on a set of Split-C parallel benchmarks. These results show that high-performance computing is possible on a network of PCs connected via Fast Ethernet.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4300/12370/00569697.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"342","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1997.569697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1997.569697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12370","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATM and fast Ethernet network interfaces for user-level communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ethernet networks","Network interfaces","Coprocessors","Workstations","Distributed computing","Computer architecture","Protection","Delay","Fabrics","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network interfaces","local area networks","asynchronous transfer mode"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATM","fast Ethernet network interfaces","user-level communication","workstation clusters","distributed computing","parallel computing","programmable coprocessors","U-Net communication architecture","high-bandwidth communication","low-latency communication","user-level access","application-level performance","Split-C parallel benchmarks","high-performance computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"ATM and fast Ethernet network interfaces for user-level communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5514284","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATM and fast Ethernet network interfaces for user-level communication","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00569697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036829S","chronDate":"1-5 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300","citationCount":"25","articleId":"569697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":569707,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

We introduce SyPVL, an efficient and numerically stable algorithm for the computation of reduced-order models of large, linear, passive networks. SyPVL represents the specialization of the more general PVL algorithm, to symmetric problems. Besides the gain in efficiency over PVL, SyPVL also preserves the symmetry of the problem, and, as a consequence, can often guarantee the stability of the resulting reduced-order models. Moreover, these reduced-order models can be synthesized as actual physical circuits, thus facilitating compatibility with existing analysis tools.

Local features of grey level images are extracted by multiresolutions of Gabor wavelets, which are scaled and rotated versions of each other. The Gabor wavelet representation is use in a innovative neural network matching approach that can provide robust recognition. Neural network matching between a model and a input image is to find out the exact correspondence of local features and to map the model to the input image based on local similarity and neighborhood grouping of local features. The results on face recognition are presented, where the objects undergo rotation, translation, local distortions, and deformation caused by facial expression.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.569740","startPage":"59","endPage":"63 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the adaptive subspace method motivated by the traditional eigenfaces approach. Our scheme begins with the standardization of face images in order to achieve some invariance of face representation under different image acquisition conditions. Then we combine the K-L expansion technique with genetic algorithms to construct an optimal feature subspace for identification. Finally, any input face image can be projected into this adaptive subspace to be identified using a minimum distance classifier. Experimental results are also given in detail and show our approach offers superior performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.569745","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

This testing procedure and design for testability (DFT) technique is general enough to handle RTL control flow intensive circuits like protocol handlers as well as data flow intensive circuits like digital filters. It makes the combined controller-data path highly testable and does not require any external behavioral information. This scheme has the advantages of low area/delay/power overheads (average of 3.2%, 0.9% and 4.1%, respectively, for benchmarks), high fault coverage (over 99% for most cases), very low test generation times (because it is independent of bit-width), and the advantage of at-speed testing. Experiments show a 2-to-4 (1-to-3) orders of magnitude test generation time advantage over an efficient gate-level sequential test generator (combinational test generator that assumes full scan).","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569798","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4215/12302/00569798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12302","startPage":"329","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design for testability technique for RTL circuits using control/data flow extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A design for testability technique for RTL circuits using control/data flow extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569798/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465437","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design for testability technique for RTL circuits using control/data flow extraction","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00569798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058635S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4215","citationCount":"24","articleId":"569798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":569810,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Lu","id":"37087421393"},{"name":"Bingxue Shi","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Bingxue Shi","id":"37087198976"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37087421264"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3280-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"569810","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569810","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Feature extraction","Hydrogen","Very large scale integration","Fuzzy neural networks","Microelectronics","Character recognition","Marine vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","neural nets","fuzzy logic","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid handwritten digits recognition system","Hamming neural network","local features","feature maps","fuzzy logic recognizer","horizontal/vertical connected component features"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.569810","pdfPath":"/iel3/4232/12270/00569810.pdf","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

At various levels of abstraction, e.g., behavioral, register-transfer level and gate level, the designer simulates the design using a large number of vectors attempting to debug and verify the design. A major problem with functional simulation is the lack of good metrics and tools to evaluate the quality of a set of functional vectors. Metrics used currently are based on instruction counts and are quite simplistic. Designers are forced to use ad-hoc methods to terminate functional simulation, e.g., CPU time limitations, We propose a new metric for measuring the extent of design verification provided by a set of functional simulation vectors. This metric is universal, and can be used uniformly for all designs. Our metric computes observability information to determine whether effects of errors that are activated by the program stimuli can be observed at the circuit outputs. We provide preliminary experimental evidence that supports the validity of the proposed metric. We believe that using this metric in design verification will result in higher-quality functional tests and improved correctness checking.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569832","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4215/12302/00569832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12302","startPage":"418","endPage":"425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An observability-based code coverage metric for functional simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=569832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An observability-based code coverage metric for functional simulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569832/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465450","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An observability-based code coverage metric for functional simulation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00569832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048399S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4215","citationCount":"63","articleId":"569832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":569844,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This method, compared to the existing interpolation methods, can be applied to arbitrary type of fuzzy sets, and does not require convex and normal sets in the rules. Another important difference is the new method gives an interpretable conclusion in every case, unlike the previously published methods. As a matter of course, to apply arbitrary type of sets, the general method makes calculation necessary for \"every point\" of the sets. A special method, based on the theory of the general method, is introduced for application in practice, which needs low computational capacity. The specialised method uses three of the most wide spread set types in practice: the crisp, the triangular, and the trapezoidal fuzzy sets. The difference between the new and the former methods is pointed out by examples and the results of different formal methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/569844/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5484119","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A general interpolation technique in fuzzy rule bases with arbitrary membership functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general interpolation technique in fuzzy rule bases with arbitrary membership functions","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00569844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042798S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232","citationCount":"46","articleId":"569844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":569866,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This method is successful in reducing both area and wire length in addition to reducing the computational time required for optimization. Although our method only searches slicing floorplans, the results are superior to the results obtained even with non-slicing floorplans.

A packing is obtained through an assignment of modules on the BSG. Followed by physical realization BSG-PACK. A simulated annealing searches for a goon packing of all packings by changing the assignments. Experiments showed that hundreds of rectangles are easily packed in a small rectangle area (chip) with quite good quality in area efficiency.

The control system consists of a series combination of both a plant with a feedback loop and a neural network with a feedforward loop. In a direct inverse controller, the neural net learns the inverse dynamics of the system. On the other hand, in a feedback-error-learning controller, the neural network functions as the reference input filter and it organizes a new reference signal to the closed-loop circuit. Experimental results for the positioning control of a piezopolymer manipulator are presented and they show that the proposed control system is effective in accurately tracking a reference signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.569871","startPage":"648","endPage":"654 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.
