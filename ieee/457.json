Pedometric Dead Reckoning (DR) navigation errors are sensitive to compass accuracy. New compass calibration algorithms in the module enable a factory level of accuracy to be achieved in practical field installations. We discuss a range of testing with special attention to indoor environments. Indoor magnetic anomalies can compromise the DR accuracy. However, the anomalies generate a unique fingerprint at a given location. A patent pending correlation technique can be used to detect this fingerprint when a user revisits the same location. This puts bounds on the growth of position errors. The same technique can be used to reduce systematic errors when operated in magnetically benign environments. We give step-by-step application examples of the technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of a new pedometric dead reckoning module in GPS denied environments","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.2008.4570048","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557992/4569960/04570048.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.2008.4570048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Use of a new pedometric dead reckoning module in GPS denied environments","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570048/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10202961","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of a new pedometric dead reckoning module in GPS denied environments","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07142008-00088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051552S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557992","isNumber":"4569960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557992","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4569960","articleId":"4570048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4570057,"authors":[{"name":"Sunmi Kim","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University"],"lastName":"Sunmi Kim","id":"37291928300"},{"name":"Heedong Choi","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University"],"lastName":"Heedong Choi","id":"37290852000"},{"name":"Juhyun Park","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Juhyun Park","id":"37066798300"},{"name":"Yongwan Park","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University"],"lastName":"Yongwan Park","id":"37293566800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1536-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1537-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-358X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-3598"}],"articleNumber":"4570057","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Multiaccess communication","Repeaters","Optical fiber cables","Nonlinear optics","Propagation delay","Base stations","Optical noise","Fiber nonlinear optics","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","mobility management (mobile radio)","radionavigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing error suppression","CDMA network","positioning system","cellular communication system","mobile station position","time difference of arrival","nonline-of-sight propagation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)","non-line-of-sight (NLOS)","Repeater"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses an improved method for location in CDMA based cellular communication system.

Very low interference between the UWB radar and GPS signals can be achieved by shaping radar pulses using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) coding, which is a multi-carrier modulation technique targeted for commercial UWB communications. The paper shows that we can, in fact, expect a very good degree of interoperability of a system used for GPS reception and UWB-OFDM radar purposes. The benefits of using UWB sensor in conjunction with GPS can be for example, to supplement positioning algorithms with radar-collected data, as well as to perform general reconnaissance of the surrounding area. The paper includes detailed analysis of the proposed multiple-use UWB-OFDM radar/GPS receiver concept, the effect of co-existing UWB-OFDM signals on GPS receiver tracking loop carrier noise level, and the impact on the quality of GPS solution in weak GPS signal environment. A brief discussion of MATLAB implementation of the modeled scenarios is presented as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557992/4569960/04570090.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.2008.4570090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.2008.4570090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On co-existence of in-band UWB-OFDM and GPS signals: Tracking performance analysis Dmitriy ^Garmatyuk","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Performance analysis","Radar tracking","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Ultra wideband radar","Pulse modulation","RF signals","Radio frequency","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","mathematics computing","OFDM modulation","target tracking","ultra wideband communication","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB-OFDM radar","GPS radar","tracking performance analysis","in-band co-existence","UWB radar","shaping radar pulses","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing coding","multicarrier modulation","UWB communications","GPS receiver tracking","MATLAB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","GPS","coexistence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"On co-existence of in-band UWB-OFDM and GPS signals: Tracking performance analysis Dmitriy ^Garmatyuk","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570090/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10203006","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On co-existence of in-band UWB-OFDM and GPS signals: Tracking performance analysis Dmitriy ^Garmatyuk","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07142008-00130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090892S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557992","isNumber":"4569960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557992","xplore-issue":"4569960","articleId":"4570090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4570124,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Sahmoudi","affiliation":["Navigation Groupe, LACIME Laboratory, Ecole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Sahmoudi","id":"37294635300"},{"name":"Moeness G.

For the GPS L1 signal, we utilize the replication property of the C/A code within each data bit to introduce a block averaging pre-processing (BAP) approach for improving receiver robustness against undesired signals. A large number of weighted signal blocks is coherently accumulated and synchronously averaged to obtain a single block with improved signal power. We present several properties of the proposed GNSS signals enhancement technique and we analyze its robustness against noise and different classes of interferers. Thus, we develop a software defined acquisition procedure using the efficient FFT correlation approach. We propose two acquisition algorithms based on the BAP approach. The first scheme implements the parallel code phase search in finding the 2-D spectrum peak using circular cross-correlations. In the second scheme, we exploit the BAP for a fast acquisition performing the frequency estimation prior to the 1-D code-phase search.","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.2008.4570124","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557992/4569960/04570124.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.2008.4570124","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition of weak GNSS signals using a new block averaging pre-processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of weak GNSS signals using a new block averaging pre-processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570124/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570124/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10203034","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of weak GNSS signals using a new block averaging pre-processing","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07142008-00164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088435S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557992","isNumber":"4569960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557992","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4569960","articleId":"4570124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4570131,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Kohler","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kohler"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-86341-892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0537-9989"}],"articleNumber":"4570131","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570131","abstract":"The AM Council, as a leading industry body in Australia is currently developing an Asset Management certification program.

The secondary network uses cognitive radio technology to make opportunistic access of the unused and/or underutilized portions of the spectrum. For such a system, we study the problem of joint power control and beamforming with the objective of minimizing the total transmitted power of the cognitive network such that the received interferences at primary users remain below a threshold level as well as the secondary users who are admitted in the system are guaranteed with their signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirements. Two iterative algorithms, one based on weighted least square (WLS) approach and the other based on admission control for secondary users, are provided to meet the strict interference protection requirement of the primary users. A numerical study is performed to show the convergence behavior of the iterative algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Iterative algorithms","Noise level","Least squares methods","Admission control","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","power control","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","joint power control","beamforming","radio spectrum","signal to interference plus noise ratio requirements","iterative algorithms","weighted least square approach","admission control","interference protection requirement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570202","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.061003","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.061003","startPage":"2415","endPage":"2419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power control and beamforming for cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint power control and beamforming for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570202/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130566","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power control and beamforming for cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060269S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4570203,"authors":[{"name":"Emad Alsusa","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Alsusa","id":"37284811700"},{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Masouros","id":"37299872300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4570203","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570203","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive coding","Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","AWGN","Wireless communication","Design optimization","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive signal processing","code division multiple access","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive code allocation","interference management","DS-CDMA systems","BPSK","multiple access interference"]}],"abstract":"A new technique based on adaptive code-to-user allocation for interference management on the downlink of BPSK based TDD DS-CDMA systems is presented.

By exploiting limited feedback from the destination terminal (central node) such that each relay is able to help forward information of multiple sources in one OFDM symbol, the proposed cooperative protocol not only achieves full diversity but also efficiently utilizes available bandwidth. A practical relay assignment scheme is also proposed to specify the pairing of sources and relays in cooperative networks. The outage probability analysis of the proposed cooperative protocol is provided, and the analytical results are validated via simulations. Moreover, a closed-form lower bound on the outage probability of any relay-assignment schemes is established to provide a performance benchmark of the proposed cooperative protocol. Based on the outage probability analysis, the optimum relay location for the proposed relay-assignment scheme is determined. Both theoretical and simulation results show that in WLAN scenario the proposed cooperative protocol can achieve significant coverage extension compared to the direct transmission.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570205.pdf","startPage":"2430","endPage":"2435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.061106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.061106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative communications protocol for multiuser OFDM networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Wireless LAN","Feedback","Bandwidth","Transmitting antennas","Power system relaying","Analytical models","Wireless application protocol","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","protocols","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communications protocol","multiuser OFDM networks","feedback","relay assignment scheme","outage probability analysis","WLAN scenario"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative communications protocol for multiuser OFDM networks","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570205/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130569","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative communications protocol for multiuser OFDM networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096762S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4570206,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianwu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37656892900"},{"name":"Yik-chung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yik-chung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281222900"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Tung-sang Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tung-sang","lastName":"Ng","id":"37280168200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4570206","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Timing","Maximum likelihood estimation","Degradation","Frequency estimation","Frequency synchronization","Frequency division multiplexing","Local oscillators","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood criterion","carrier frequency offset","ML joint CFO estimator","channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","quasisynchronized OFDM system","mean square error method","MSE analysis"]}],"abstract":"This letter addresses the problem of joint estimation of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel for OFDM systems in the presence of timing ambiguity.

However, the ML decoding complexity of STBCs becomes prohibitive large as the number of transmit and receive antennas increase. Hence it is natural to resort to a suboptimal reception technique like linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receiver. Barbarossa et al and Liu et al have independently derived necessary and sufficient conditions for a full rate linear STBC to be MMSE optimal, i.e achieve least symbol error rate (SER). Motivated by this problem, certain existing high rate STBC constructions from crossed product algebras are identified to be MMSE optimal. Also, it is shown that a certain class of codes from cyclic division algebras which are special cases of crossed product algebras are MMSE optimal. Hence, these STBCs achieve least SER when MMSE reception is employed and are fully diverse when ML reception is employed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570212/","accessionNumber":"10130530","displayDocTitle":"MMSE optimal algebraic space-time codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE optimal algebraic space-time codes","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061825S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4570214,"authors":[{"name":"Seokhyun Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dankook University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokhyun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37279393500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4570214","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Resource management","Throughput","Feedback","Algorithm design and analysis","Diversity methods","Frequency domain analysis","Parameter estimation","Radio spectrum management","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","parameter estimation","resource allocation","Rician channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ricean model based design","subchannelized multiuser OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel quality information","CQI feedback","user-multiplexing","Ricean model based analysis","two-step dynamic resource allocation algorithm","Ricean parameter estimation","subchannel structure","network throughput behavior"]}],"abstract":"The dynamic resource allocation and throughput behavior of a sub-channelized multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system are considered.

The base station transmits multiple pilot sequences using orthogonal beams, and each user feeds the channel gain of each beam back. Then, the base station selects the subset of users and beams for which the sum-rate is maximized. We aim to exploit spatial multiplexing gain in a controlled fashion, i.e., the number of beams used for data transmission is chosen depending on the available multiuser diversity in the system. Two schemes are proposed: dynamic Orthonormal Random Beamforming with Systematic Beam Selection (ORBF/SBS), for which the number of beams used for data transmission is dynamically changed from one fading block to another so that the sum-rate is maximized; and static ORBF/SBS, which selects a fixed number of beams for a given signal-to-noise ratio and user number. The static scheme achieves the sum-rate of the dynamic one up to a small gap with much reduced computational and feedback complexity. We derive an approximate expression for the sum-rate achieved by the dynamic scheme, and provide insight into the optimal data stream number in the static scheme by means of asymptotical results. Computer simulations are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570218.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","startPage":"2512","endPage":"2525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the balance of multiuser diversity and spatial multiplexing gain in random beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the balance of multiuser diversity and spatial multiplexing gain in random beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130535","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570218/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the balance of multiuser diversity and spatial multiplexing gain in random beamforming","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106517S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4570221,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Musavian","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570221/4570221-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leila Musavian (S'05-M'07) obtained her Ph.D. degree in Telecommunications from King's College London, UK, in 2006 and her B.

Furthermore, we show that in the absence of correlation, the gap between the mutual information bounds is maximum for beamforming and minimum for uniform input power allocation over the transmit antennas. We further prove that utilizing the input power of each user towards the directions of the eigenvectors of its transmit correlation matrix maximizes the mutual information lower bound. Moreover, we derive the transmit directions that maximize the mutual information lower and upper bounds in an uncorrelated MIMO MAC with delayed feedback from the receiver to the transmitters, and characterize the power allocation of this system in terms of its beamforming range. Numerical simulations are conducted to corroborate our theoretical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570221.pdf","startPage":"2549","endPage":"2559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the achievable sum-rate of correlated mimo multiple access channel with imperfect channel estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Mutual information","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing","Covariance matrix","Upper bound","Delay","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlated MIMO multiple access channel","channel estimation","correlation information","Gaussian input signals","covariance matrix","transmit antennas","mutual information bounds","delayed feedback","power allocation","beamforming range"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the achievable sum-rate of correlated mimo multiple access channel with imperfect channel estimation","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570221/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130538","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the achievable sum-rate of correlated mimo multiple access channel with imperfect channel estimation","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114394S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570223,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Xiao","affiliation":["WINLAB, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570223/4570223-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Xiao received the B.S. in communication engineering in 2000 from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, and the M.S. in electrical engineering in 2003 from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

In this paper we propose ways to exploit the spatial variability of the radio channel response in a rich scattering environment, as is typical of indoor environments. Specifically, we describe a physical-layer authentication algorithm that utilizes channel probing and hypothesis testing to determine whether current and prior communication attempts are made by the same transmit terminal. In this way, legitimate users can be reliably authenticated and false users can be reliably detected. We analyze the ability of a receiver to discriminate between transmitters (users) according to their channel frequency responses. This work is based on a generalized channel response with both spatial and temporal variability, and considers correlations among the time, frequency and spatial domains. Simulation results, using the ray-tracing tool WiSE to generate the time-averaged response, verify the efficacy of the approach under realistic channel conditions, as well as its capability to work under unknown channel variations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070194","startPage":"2571","endPage":"2579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570223.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the physical layer for wireless authentication in time-variant channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Using the physical layer for wireless authentication in time-variant channels","volume":"7","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130540","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570223/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the physical layer for wireless authentication in time-variant channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119349S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4570224,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570224/4570224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Fu was with the School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, U.K. from 2001 to 2003.

The channel model includes large-scale signal attenuation and small-scale fading. By using a form analogous to Shannon's channel capacity formula, a logarithmic relationship between the instantaneous data rate and the C/I with AMC is first established.

For wireless fading channels, the optimum decision test is obtained by computing and thresholding a new proposed decision statistic: the \"hybrid\" non-coherent accumulation. Hybrid accumulation combines magnitude and power accumulations of the received antenna data, across multiple coherence intervals, or multiple coherence bands.

However, high throughput is achieved at the expense of high latency. We study a novel broadcasting HARQ strategy. The multi-layer broadcast approach is suitable for the case where transmitter has no channel state information (CSI), which is the case with HARQ schemes as well. The broadcast approach enables the receiver to decode rates, which are matched to every fading gain realization. That is, the higher the fading gain realization, the more layers are reliably decoded. The broadcast approach combined with HARQ enables achieving high throughput with low latency. In a broadcast HARQ scheme every code layer supports HARQ independently. Thus HARQ is applied in every transmission block to undecoded layers only, which highly increases the broadcast approach efficiency. In this paper, both broadcast chase combining (BCC) HARQ and broadcast incremental redundancy (BIR) HARQ are studied in the limit of infinitely many layers, and for finite level coding. Interestingly, with continuous broadcasting the BCC-HARQ is found to closely approximate the BIR-HARQ, while using a sub-optimal broadcasting power distribution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570230.pdf","startPage":"2640","endPage":"2650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-layer broadcasting hybrid-ARQ strategies for block fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Fading","Throughput","Decoding","Delay","Parity check codes","Transmitters","Channel state information","Redundancy","Automatic repeat request"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel estimation","fading channels","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block fading channels","multilayer broadcasting","hybrid-ARQ strategies","automatic retransmission request","channel state information","fading gain realization","broadcast chase combining HARQ","broadcast incremental redundancy HARQ","suboptimal broadcasting power distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer broadcasting hybrid-ARQ strategies for block fading channels","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570230/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130546","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer broadcasting hybrid-ARQ strategies for block fading channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053611S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4570231,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, TRLaboratories, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570231/4570231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dusit Niyato (S'05) is working towards his Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Manitoba.

In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum sharing among a primary user and multiple secondary users. We formulate this problem as an oligopoly market competition and use a noncooperative game to obtain the spectrum allocation for secondary users. Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game. We first present the formulation of a static game for the case where all secondary users have the current information of the adopted strategies and the payoff of each other. However, this assumption may not be realistic in some cognitive radio systems. Therefore, we consider the case of bounded rationality in which the secondary users gradually and iteratively adjust their strategies based on the observations on their previous strategies. The speed of adjustment of the strategies is controlled by the learning rate. The stability condition of the dynamic behavior for this spectrum sharing scheme is investigated. The numerical results reveal the dynamics of distributed dynamic adaptation of spectrum sharing strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570231.pdf","startPage":"2651","endPage":"2660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks: a dynamic game approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570231/","displayDocTitle":"Competitive spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks: a dynamic game approach","volume":"7","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130547","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570231/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks: a dynamic game approach","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126218S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4570232,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570232/4570232-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xing Tan received the BS degree and MS degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, China in 2003 and 2005.

Unfortunately, block diagonalization neglects other-cell interference (OCI), which limits the performance of users at the edge of the cell. This paper presents an OCI-aware enhancement to block diagonalization that uses a whitening filter for interference suppression at the receiver and a novel precoder using the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix for each user at the transmitter. For complex Gaussian matrix channels, the asymptotic sum rate of the proposed system is analyzed under a large antenna assumption for isotropic inputs and compared to conventional block diagonalization. The capacity loss due to OCI is quantified in terms of results from single-user MIMO capacity. Several numerical examples compare achievable sum rates, the proposed asymptotic rates, and the capacity loss, in low and high interference regimes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block diagonalization for multi-user MIMO with other-cell interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570233.pdf","startPage":"2671","endPage":"2681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Block diagonalization for multi-user MIMO with other-cell interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570233/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130549","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block diagonalization for multi-user MIMO with other-cell interference","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108197S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570234,"authors":[{"name":"Evaggelia Matskani","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570234/4570234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Evaggelia Matskani received the Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece (2005), and the M.S. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Crete (2007), where she is currently a Ph.D candidate.

When there are many co-channel users and/or the service constraints are stringent, the problem becomes infeasible and some form of admission control is necessary. We advocate a cross-layer approach to joint multiuser transmit beamforming and admission control, aiming to maximize the number of users that can be served at their desired QoS. It is shown that the core problem is NP-hard, yet amenable to convex approximation tools. Two computationally efficient convex approximation algorithms are proposed: one is based on semidefinite relaxation of an equivalent problem reformulation; the other takes a penalized second-order cone approach. Their performance is assessed in a range of experiments, using both simulated and measured channel data. In all experiments considered, the proposed algorithms work remarkably well in terms of the attained performance-complexity trade-off, consistently exhibiting close to optimal performance at an affordable computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570234.pdf","startPage":"2682","endPage":"2693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convex approximation techniques for joint multiuser downlink beamforming and admission control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570234/","displayDocTitle":"Convex approximation techniques for joint multiuser downlink beamforming and admission control","volume":"7","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130550","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570234/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex approximation techniques for joint multiuser downlink beamforming and admission control","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13726S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4570235,"authors":[{"name":"Sungeun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570235/4570235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sungeun Lee (S'05) received the B.S. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering and in computer science and industrial system engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002, and his M.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, in 2004.

The proposed estimator applies interference mitigation to pilot symbols, using repeated interference features according to the pilot subcarrier distance. In order to use this property, the proposed estimator employs a specific pilot structure which consists of two types of pilot symbols with different pilot density. The combination of interference alleviation and pilot rearrangement not only makes the channel estimation robust to the time-selectivity of the channel but also reduces the number of pilot subcarriers needed to estimate the channel. To clarify the advantages of the proposed method, the average mean square errors (MSE) of the frequency channel estimate are derived for the proposed estimator with unequal pilot density, and it is compared with general estimators with equal pilot density. Numerical analysis and simulation results confirm that the proposed estimator with unequal density relationship outperforms the estimators over practical time-varying environments in terms of MSE performance and pilot overhead efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation approach with variable pilot density to mitigate interference over time-selective cellular OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070114","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570235.pdf","startPage":"2694","endPage":"2704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation approach with variable pilot density to mitigate interference over time-selective cellular OFDM systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570235/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130551","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation approach with variable pilot density to mitigate interference over time-selective cellular OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075479S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4570237,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-hsing Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570237/4570237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Hsing Kuo received his BS and the PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.

Soft QoS traffic here refers to the traffic which demands certain amount of bandwidth for normal operation but allows some flexibility when the given bandwidth is close to the preferred value. The resource requirement of soft QoS traffic can be described with sigmoid utility function. Our objective is to maximize the total utility of all soft QoS flows without going through a wireless bidding process. We develop essential theorems as the design guidelines for this problem, and then propose a sub-optimal, polynomial time solution based on the developed theorems. We prove that the difference in the performance of our mechanism and the optimal solution is bounded. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated via simulations. The results show that our solution can adapt to any types of soft QoS flows. Specifically, it acts like a hard QoS system and allocates resource in a fairness-oriented manner when the utility functions of flows are unit-step functions; on the other hand, when the utility functions are concave, it behaves like a best effort system and allocates resource in a throughput-oriented way.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","startPage":"2714","endPage":"2722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility-based radio resource allocation for QoS traffic in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Utility-based radio resource allocation for QoS traffic in wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130553","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-based radio resource allocation for QoS traffic in wireless networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060774S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4570238,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Y.

While conventional closed-loop OFDM systems attempt to pre-equalize the channel through power loading, we propose an average signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) maximizing strategy based on the allocation of pilot locations. Our derivation for the average output SNR of OFDM systems with interpolated channel estimation reveals a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of the pilot- symbol locations. Using this framework, we arrive at the SNR gain achieved in using uniform and non-uniform pilot locations. Further, we present simple sub-optimum solutions based on decoupled optimization and show how minor adjustments of these solutions can also lead to very favorable error rate performances. The proposed solutions are simulated in a wide range of Doppler frequencies and compared to uniform pilot allocation in terms of average symbol error rate.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570238.pdf","startPage":"2723","endPage":"2731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-uniform pilot-symbol allocation for closed-loop OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570238/","displayDocTitle":"Non-uniform pilot-symbol allocation for closed-loop OFDM","volume":"7","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130554","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570238/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-uniform pilot-symbol allocation for closed-loop OFDM","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062592S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570239,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent K.N.

They are the system goodput gain as well as the packet diversity gain. The former aspect of cross-layer designs has been well- studied under perfect CSIT conditions and is known as the multi-user diversity gain (MuDiv). In cross-layer OFDMA systems with perfect CSIT, it is well known that the system throughput (ergodic capacity) scales in the order of O(log log Kldquo) due to the MuDiv gain, where K is the number users. However, in slow fading channels with delayed CSIT, there will always be potential packet errors (due to channel outage if the scheduled data rate exceeds the instantaneous mutual information) even if very strong channel coding is applied at the base station. In this case, the cross-layer packet outage diversity is important to protect the packet errors due to channel outage and there is a natural tradeoff between the goodput gain and packet diversity. In this paper, we shall focus on the asymptotic tradeoff analysis between the system goodput gain and the packet outage diversity gain in cross-layer OFDMA systems with delayed CSIT.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","startPage":"2732","endPage":"2739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic tradeoff between cross-layer goodput gain and outage diversity in OFDMA systems with slow fading and delayed CSIT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic tradeoff between cross-layer goodput gain and outage diversity in OFDMA systems with slow fading and delayed CSIT","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10173374","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570239/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic tradeoff between cross-layer goodput gain and outage diversity in OFDMA systems with slow fading and delayed CSIT","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086861S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4570240,"authors":[{"name":"Emmeric Tanghe","affiliation":["IBBT/Ugent INTEC Interdisciplinary Institute of BroadBand Technology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570240/4570240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emmeric Tanghe was born in Tielt, Belgium on August 31, 1982.

The key feature of the proposed strategy is that, via opportunistically adapting its transmit power, the cognitive user can maximize its achievable transmission rate without degrading the outage probability of the primary user. If compared with the existing cognitive protocols, which usually try to keep the instantaneous rate of the primary user unchanged, our strategy relieves the cognitive users from the burden of detecting and relaying the message of the primary user and relaxes the system synchronization requirements. The achievable rate of a cognitive user under the proposed power control strategy is analyzed and simulated, taking into account the impact of imperfect channel estimation. A modified power control strategy is also proposed to reduce the sensitivity of our strategy to the estimation errors. Its effectiveness is verified by the simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070145","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570241.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2752","endPage":"2761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On cognitive radio networks with opportunistic power control strategies in fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On cognitive radio networks with opportunistic power control strategies in fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570241/","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570241/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130556","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On cognitive radio networks with opportunistic power control strategies in fading channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056714S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4570242,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-nan Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570242/4570242-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yao-Nan Lee received the B.S. degree in 2001, the M.S. degree in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in 2007, all from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

However, the performance of such an iterative approach depends on not only the construction of the iteratively refined soft channel, but also the structure of the adopted error-correction code. Through extrinsic information transfer chart analysis, we investigate the impact of different soft channel construction schemes on multicarrier systems possessing turbo coding/modulation structures: (1) one with bit-interleaved coded modulation signals, and (2) the other with low-density parity- check code encoded modulation signals. It is shown that the former benefits significantly from iterative information processing regardless of channel construction scheme and the performance of the systems with different schemes converges. On the contrary, the same observation cannot be applied to the latter, a capacity- approaching system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570242/","accessionNumber":"10130557","displayDocTitle":"Impact of soft channel construction on iterative channel estimation and data decoding for multicarrier systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of soft channel construction on iterative channel estimation and data decoding for multicarrier systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2762.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063779S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4570244,"authors":[{"name":"Shaowei Lin","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4570199/4570244/4570244-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaowei Lin received the B.

We also extend the BD- GMD to the block diagonal uniform channel decomposition (BD- UCD) with which the MIMO broadcast channel capacity can be achieved. Our proposed schemes decompose each user's MIMO channel into parallel subchannels with identical SNRs/SINRs, thus equal-rate coding can be applied across the subchannels of each user.

Moreover, to further improve the utilization of RACH in an OFDMA system, we propose a novel message transmission scheme in a shared RACH. The message in the proposed scheme can be sent implicitly in the cyclic-shifted preambles which make the transmission much more reliable in a contention based RACH. Meanwhile, performance of the preamble detection has also been improved by the redundant information conveyed in messages.

The phase difference between two correlated complex Nakagami random variables (RVs) is proposed and its statistical properties are investigated. A closed-form expression for the distribution is obtained using an approach from [1] and depends on the Nakagami-m parameter and the power correlation coefficient (p) between two correlated complex RVs. A simple approximation is given when p is close to unity. The proposed phase difference is shown to accurately approximate that of the Ricean. We derive the joint density function of this phase difference and its associated correlated envelopes. This is given in a closed form in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function, but the RVs can be easily generated for simulation. We analyze the impact of imperfect CSI on the bit error rate (BER) of uncoded and coded modulation. For uncoded modulation, the average BER and a closed-form expression of the asymptotic BER or error floor are obtained. For coded modulation, we determine the error free feedback bound of bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding for both perfect and imperfect CSI. We show that imperfect phase estimation is the major cause of the error floor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570247.pdf","startPage":"2805","endPage":"2813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nakagami fading phase difference distribution and its impact on BER performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nakagami distribution","Fading","Bit error rate","Modulation coding","Closed-form solution","Channel state information","Random variables","Density functional theory","Feedback","Interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","modulation coding","Nakagami channels","Rician channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami fading phase difference distribution","BER","channel state information","Nakagami-m fading channels","random variables","statistical properties","Nakagami-m parameter","power correlation coefficient","Ricean channel","generalized hypergeometric function","uncoded modulation","bit error rate","iterative decoding","bit-interleaved coded modulation","phase estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A nakagami fading phase difference distribution and its impact on BER performance","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570247/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130562","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nakagami fading phase difference distribution and its impact on BER performance","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064637S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570248,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

The method adapts each beam by computing at the receiver the steepest-ascent adaptation direction and feeding the quantized direction vector back to the transmitter; we call it the quantized-feedback optimal adaptive multi-beamforming algorithm. The method is widely flexible in the number of quantization bits and offers an adaptive diversity technique that allows for transmission of multiple data streams on orthogonal beams, thereby substantially increasing the system capacity or providing a new radio link for a new service. The convergence speed is maximized by computing the optimal increment vector which points in the direction of largest directional derivative of the objective function. We show that the algorithm converges globally irrespective of quantization error: the quantized increment vector always provides positive directional derivative at any non-stationary point in the solution space containing no local maxima. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the method.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4570199/04570249.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2828","endPage":"2838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized-feedback optimal adaptive multi-beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Quantized-feedback optimal adaptive multi-beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570249/","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4570249/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130564","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized-feedback optimal adaptive multi-beamforming","sourcePdf":"tw_0807_2828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106027S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4570199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","xplore-issue":"4570199","articleId":"4570249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4570250,"authors":[{"name":"Choon Sae Lee","affiliation":["De Montfort University, Leicester, UK","Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Choon Sae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280420300"},{"name":"Alistair Duffy","affiliation":["De Montfort University, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Alistair","lastName":"Duffy","id":"37277330000"},{"name":"Chanam Lee","affiliation":["Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chanam","lastName":"Lee","id":"37538845600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4570250","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":522},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Reverberation chamber","Frequency measurement","Current measurement","Reflector antennas","Electrical resistance measurement","Electric variables measurement","Transmitting antennas","Radiofrequency identification","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monopole antennas","reverberation chambers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna efficiency measurement","reverberation chamber","reference antenna","monopole antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna efficiency","reverberation chamber","Wheeler method"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a reverberation chamber approach for antenna efficiency measurement that does not require a reference antenna, that allows the antenna efficiency to be determined over a potentially wide frequency, range and which is applicable to electrically large antennas, thus demonstrating clear advantages over currently employed techniques for antenna efficiency measurement.

It's important to model the generation and propagation of the EM waves emitted from PD for understanding the physical mechanism. Maxwell's equations for the EM waves are replaced by a set of finite difference equations such as the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD suffers from phase error caused by its numerical dispersion. We numerically analyzes the EM waves emitted from PD in time-frequency using the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method, which is higher accuracy than the FDTD, and the in-place fast Haar wavelet transform (IP-FHWT).

In previous work, some authors have investigated issues related to the ways to choose a mother wavelet, strategies to denoise PDs and its in field usability. This paper presents a realtime system for partial discharge signal denoising and processing using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Real-time processing is an important feature for PD analysis since it allows data acquisition for long periods, leading to a better statistical characterization. Moreover, real-time processing presents benefits for the investigation of new diagnostic procedures and the development of more specific PD applications, like on-line monitoring. The developed system can be used as a preprocessing unit coupled to an existing PD analyzer or a standalone unit employed both for PD acquisition and denoising. Continuous stream processing is carried out by an appropriate border treatment both during DWT processing and PD extraction. Deterministic behavior is guaranteed by a dedicated hardware architecture associated to a real-time operating system. Hardware based optimizations allowed acquisition rates comparable to commercial PD analyzers. The results were obtained with a focus on performance evaluation in terms of computational loads, storage requirements and noise removal for several wavelet filters, decomposition levels and denoising techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time processing system for denoising of partial discharge signals using the wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2008 IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/ELINSL.2008.4570356","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 2008 IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4544566/4570258/04570356.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELINSL.2008.4570356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A real-time processing system for denoising of partial discharge signals using the wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"9-12 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570356/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10068143","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time processing system for denoising of partial discharge signals using the wavelet transform","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISEI-00-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103738S","chronDate":"9-12 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4544566","isNumber":"4570258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4544566","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4570258","articleId":"4570356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4570439,"authors":[{"name":"Siyang Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4585407/4570439/4570439-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siyang Zheng received the B.S. degree in biological sciences and biotechnologies from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1996, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, University Park, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, in 2007 under the guidance of Dr. Yu-Chong Tai.","He was with Lucent Technologies, Holmdel, NJ, for one year before he joined the Micromachining Group, Caltech, as a graduate student in 2002.

Unlike previously demonstrated passive fluidic devices for particle separation, the local geometry of the bifurcated side channels was used as a design parameter. The design of the devices was based on 2-D fluidic simulation of a T-shaped model. This novel approach was proved to be effective in predicting device performance. The critical particle size for separation was clearly defined in the bifurcated region by simulation under the established theoretical framework. We validated the operation principle of the devices by separating 5- and 10-mum polystyrene beads. Human leukocytes were also successfully separated from erythrocytes with 97% efficiency. The separation region of the device had a small footprint for the separation of particles in micrometer range, which makes this device a good candidate to be integrated into a lab-on-a-chip system. The particles were collected in different exit channels after they were separated, which facilitated further sensing and processing. Similar to cross-flow filters, particles were separated perpendicular to the flow direction. The filtering effect was achieved with the collection zones established by the fluidic field. Clogging was minimized by designing the minimal channel width of the devices larger than the largest particle diameter. Solvent exchange could be accomplished for particles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streamline-Based Microfluidic Devices for Erythrocytes and Leukocytes Separation","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2008.924274","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4585407/04570439.pdf","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2008.924274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4585407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Streamline-Based Microfluidic Devices for Erythrocytes and Leukocytes Separation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4570439/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10178053","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streamline-Based Microfluidic Devices for Erythrocytes and Leukocytes Separation","sourcePdf":"17jmems04-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106548S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4585407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4585407","articleId":"4570439","onlineDate":"18 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4570449,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Joon Lee","affiliation":["Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Joon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37367720800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4570449","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Link adaptation is investigated for OFDMA systems with multiple transmit antennas, where the transmission rate is adapted and where the subcarriers to be used and the multiple antenna transmission scheme to be applied are adaptively selected, according to instantaneous SNR and user mobility.

Recently, flash memory becomes a popular storage alternative for many portable devices with the continuing improvements on its capacity, reliability and much lower power consumption than mechanical hard drives. The characteristics of flash memory are quite different from a magnetic disk. Therefore, in this paper, we revisit virtual memory system design considering limitations imposed by flash memory. In particular, we focus on the energy efficient aspect since power is the first-order design consideration for embedded systems. Due to the write-once feature of flash memory, frequent writes incur frequent garbage collection thereby introducing significant energy overhead. Therefore, in this paper, we propose three methods to reduce writes to flash memory. The HotCache scheme adds an SRAM cache to buffer frequent writes. The subpaging technique partitions a page into subunits, and only dirty subpages are written to flash memory. The duplication-aware garbage collection method exploits data redundancy between the main memory and flash memory to reduce writes incurred by garbage collection. We also identify one type of data locality that is inherent in accesses to flash memory in the virtual memory system, intrapage locality. Intrapage locality needs to be carefully maintained for data allocation in flash memory. Destroying intrapage locality causes noticeable increases in energy consumption. Experimental results show that the average energy reduction of combined subpaging, HotCache, and duplication-aware garbage collection techniques is 42.2%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4570466/04570467.pdf","startPage":"952","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Flash Memory Management in Virtual Memory System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Flash Memory Management in Virtual Memory System","volume":"16","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117845","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570467/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570467/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Flash Memory Management in Virtual Memory System","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi07-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080226S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4570466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4570466","articleId":"4570467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4570468,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Jen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4570466/4570468/4570468-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yen-Jen Chang (M'02) received the M.S. degree in computer science and information engineering from Chung-Yuan Christian University, Jhongli City, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and information engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2003.","He joined the faculty of the Department of Computer Science at National ChungHsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, in February 2004 and is currently an Associate Professor.

Due to the parallel comparison feature where a large amount of transistors are active on each lookup, however, the power consumption of CAM is usually considerable. This paper presents a hybrid-type CAM design which aims to combine the performance advantage of the NOR-type CAM with the power efficiency of the NAND-type CAM. In our design, a CAM word is divided into two segments, and then all the CAM cells are decoupled from the match line. By minimizing both the match line capacitances and switching activities, our design can largely reduce the power consumption of CAM. The experimental results show that the hybrid-type CAM can reduce the search energy consumption by roughly 89% compared to the traditional NOR-type CAM. Because the hybrid-type CAM provides a fast pull-down path to speed up the lightweight match line discharge, the search performance of our design is even better than that of the traditional NOR-type CAM.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4570466/04570468.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid-Type CAM Design for Both Power and Performance Efficiency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","Energy consumption","Degradation","Hardware","Capacitance","Table lookup","Frequency","Costs","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","integrated circuit design","NAND circuits","NOR circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance efficiency","hybrid-type content-addressable memory design","hardware table","transistors","power consumption","NOR-type content-addressable memory","NAND-type content-addressable memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content-addressable memory (CAM)","hybrid-type CAM","NAND-type CAM","NOR-type CAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid-Type CAM Design for Both Power and Performance Efficiency","volume":"16","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4570468/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10117846","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid-Type CAM Design for Both Power and Performance Efficiency","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi07-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085369S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4570466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4570466","articleId":"4570468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4570474,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4570466/4570474/4570474-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Teng (CT) Lin (S'88\u2013M'91\u2013SM'99\u2013F'05) received the B.S. degree in control engineering from National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1996, and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.","Since August 1992, he has been with the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, NCTU, where he is currently the University Provost and the Chair Professor of Electrical and Control Engineering.

The segment shift register (SSR) and overturn shift register (OSR) structure are adopted to minimize the register cost for the input re-ordering and post computation operations in the 8times8 2D DCT mode, respectively. Moreover, the retrenched constant multiplier and eight-folded complex multiplier structures are adopted to decrease the multiplier cost and the coefficient ROM size with the complex conjugate symmetry rule and subexpression elimination technology. To further decrease the chip cost, a finite wordlength analysis is provided to indicate that the proposed architecture only requires a 13-bit internal wordlength to achieve 40-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance in 256-point FFT/IFFT modes and high digital video (DV) compression quality in 8 times 8 2D DCT mode. The comprehensive comparison results indicate that the proposed cost effective reconfigurable design has the smallest hardware requirement and largest hardware utilization among the tested architectures for the FFT/IFFT computation, and thus has the highest cost efficiency.

Traditional methodologies, as well as new tools, such as Cebatech's C2R untimed-C synthesizer have been employed in the design of the system. The SSS2 platform specifies a parametric number of scalar processing elements, based on multiple 32-bit Sparc-compliant engines, augmented with LE2, an ESL-designed 2-way LIW/SIMD accelerator. LE2, which is purely designed in C, exposes a consistent interface to its SIMD datapath directly which is directly derived from the C-source of open-source image processing codes. It is synthesized to Verilog RTL with C2R. Behaviorally-synthesized SIMD datapaths are then 'plugged-in' into the exposed LE2 datapath interface. The LE2 memory interface can be either a cache- based configurable vector load/store unit or a multi-banked, multi-channel streaming local memory system. Results drawn from this work strongly suggest a shift towards a hybrid approach in designing multi-core systems for high bandwidth streaming and for dealing with large scale medical image transfers and non-linear bio-signal processing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time VLSI architecture for bio-medical monitoring","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570564","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562568/4570483/04570564.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Real-time VLSI architecture for bio-medical monitoring","conferenceDate":"30-31 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570564/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10089680","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time VLSI architecture for bio-medical monitoring","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-07162008-00081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069062S","chronDate":"30-31 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562568","isNumber":"4570483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562568","xplore-issue":"4570483","articleId":"4570564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4570587,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Sebert","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Sebert","id":"38094334800"},{"name":"Yi Ming Zou","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Ming Zou","id":"37636048800"},{"name":"Leslie Ying","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA"],"firstName":"Leslie","lastName":"Ying","id":"37287708500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2254-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2255-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"4570587","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":769},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Sparse matrices","Biomedical imaging","Probability distribution","Biomedical measurements","Encoding","Image reconstruction","Filters","Vectors","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","medical image processing","statistical distributions","Toeplitz matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Toeplitz block matrix","compressed sensing","probability distributions","signal recovery","medical imaging systems","image reconstruction","filter coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Toeplitz block matrix","random point spread function"]}],"abstract":"Recent work in compressed sensing theory shows that sensing matrices whose entries are drawn independently from certain probability distributions guarantee exact recovery of a sparse signal from a small number of measurements with high probability.

The most desirable property of CS in MRI application is that it allows sampling of k-space well below Nyquist sampling rate, while still being able to reconstruct the image if certain conditions are satisfied. Recent work has successfully applied CS to reduce scanning time in conventional Fourier imaging. In this paper, the application of CS to parallel imaging, a fast imaging technique, is investigated to achieve an even higher imaging speed. The sampling scheme for incoherence is discussed and reconstruction method using Begman iteration is proposed. Our experiments show that the combined method, named SparseSENSE, can achieve a reduction factor higher than the number of channels.","doi":"10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570588","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562568/4570483/04570588.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsesense: Application of compressed sensing in parallel MRI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570588/","displayDocTitle":"Sparsesense: Application of compressed sensing in parallel MRI","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10089727","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570588/","conferenceDate":"30-31 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsesense: Application of compressed sensing in parallel MRI","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-07162008-00105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050988S","chronDate":"30-31 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562568","isNumber":"4570483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562568","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4570483","articleId":"4570588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4570600,"authors":[{"name":"Yalin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Yalin Zhang","id":"37405823900"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Qinyu Zhang","id":"37289942300"},{"name":"Shaohua Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Shaohua Wu","id":"37407118000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2254-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2255-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"4570600","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Fourier transforms","Time frequency analysis","Additive white noise","Signal to noise ratio","Independent component analysis","Interference","Gaussian noise","Biomedical engineering","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","Fourier transforms","medical signal detection","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical signal detection","fractional Fourier transform","time frequency analysis","biomedical signal processing","nonstationary weak signal detection","additive white Gaussian noise","multicomponent chirps","signal interference"]}],"abstract":"As a generalization of classical Fourier transformation (FT), the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) outperforms many other time frequency analysis techniques with its higher time-frequency resolution, but it is quite new to be employed into the biomedical signal processing.

In this approach, DNA sequences are resampled a number of times according to the codon bias hypothesis. In order to detect the period-3 pattern in the protein-coding regions (exons) of a gene, the resampled sequences are transformed to numerical signals through a proper mapping method, and spectral analysis is then applied to the resulting digital signals. Such resampling reduces spurious periodicities in the DNA sequence and thus achieves higher discriminative power in detecting exons from a DNA sequence. The advantage of this method is demonstrated by an experiment to the DNA sequence of the Stellate Cell Activation-associated Protein (STAP). The method can be an integrated part of more advanced gene prediction algorithms for improved accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570626","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562568/4570483/04570626.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved gene prediction by resampling-based spectral analysis of DNA sequence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570626/","displayDocTitle":"Improved gene prediction by resampling-based spectral analysis of DNA sequence","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10089779","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570626/","conferenceDate":"30-31 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved gene prediction by resampling-based spectral analysis of DNA sequence","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-07162008-00143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04546S","chronDate":"30-31 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562568","isNumber":"4570483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562568","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4570483","articleId":"4570626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570642,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Tang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Tang","id":"38080161600"},{"name":"Si-ping Chen","affiliation":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Si-ping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290956900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2254-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2255-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"4570642","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570642","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Information technology","Biomedical engineering","Noise generators","Concrete","Nearest neighbor searches","Data analysis","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generation mechanism","synthetic minority class examples","class imbalance problem","medical image analysis","oversampling algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The class imbalance problem, which exists in the field of medical image analysis universally, may cause a significant deterioration to the performance of the standard classifiers.

Independent component analysis (ICA) has already shown to be an effective and applicable method for EEG de-noising. While ICA is used to correct ocular artifact, the key lies in how to identify the artifact component. Now many processing methods have been proposed. However, most of these methods were manually or semi-automatically implemented, which was time-consuming. In this work, an ICA-based method was proposed to automatically correct eye blink artifact in the case of no reference EOG from multi-channel EEG recordings. Sample entropy, a measure of data regularity, was used to identify the artifact components after ICA decomposition. The method is easily realized and can automatically correct the eye blink artifact without artificial interference. The proposed method has been tested by EEG data collected during rapid a go/nogo visual categorization task. It is demonstrated that the proposed ICA-based method, combined with sample entropy, is appropriate for automatic eye blink artifact correction in multi-channel EEG recordings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ICA-based method for automatic eye blink artifact correction in multi-channel EEG","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570649","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562568/4570483/04570649.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"An ICA-based method for automatic eye blink artifact correction in multi-channel EEG","conferenceDate":"30-31 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570649/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10089765","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ICA-based method for automatic eye blink artifact correction in multi-channel EEG","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-07162008-00166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057249S","chronDate":"30-31 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562568","isNumber":"4570483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562568","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4570483","articleId":"4570649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570782,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Ansaloni","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Ansaloni","id":"37400542400"},{"name":"Paolo Bonzini","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Bonzini","id":"37400557300"},{"name":"Laura Pozzi","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Pozzi","id":"37282505400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2333-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2334-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4570782","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconfigurable logic","Programmable logic arrays","Field programmable gate arrays","Reconfigurable architectures","Hardware","Arithmetic","Table lookup","Boolean functions","Switches","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expression-grained reconfigurable arrays","microprocessors","FPGA","coarse grained reconfigurable arrays","ALU cluster","flexible interconnect","reconfigurable logic","hardwired logic","architectural exploration","reconfigurable fabric"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570782","abstract":"Reconfigurable Arrays combine the benefit of spatial execution, typical of hardware solutions, with that of programmability, present in microprocessors. When mapping software applications (or parts of them) onto hardware, however, FPGAs often provide more flexibility than is needed, and do not implement coarser-level operations efficiently. Therefore, Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) have been proposed to this aim. While most CGRA designs feature an array cell of the order of an ALU, this paper proposes a new kind of coarse grained array, called EGRA (Expression-Grained Reconfigurable Array), featuring a cell composed of a cluster of ALUs with flexible interconnect. The EGRA attempts to further close the performance gap between reconfigurable and hardwired logic by implementing an arithmetic/logic expression per cell, rather than a single operation. A mapping methodology is proposed that can retargetably compile to a family of EGRAs, therefore enabling architectural exploration of the granularity of the proposed cell. Performance results on a number of embedded applications show that EGRAs can be used as a reconfigurable fabric for customizable processors, outperforming more traditional CGRA designs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570777","publicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547461/4570777/04570782.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2008.4570782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2008.4570782","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Architectural Exploration of Expression-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570782/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Architectural Exploration of Expression-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays","htmlLink":"/document/4570782/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 June 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10076739","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Architectural Exploration of Expression-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SASP08-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074849S","chronDate":"8-9 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547461","isNumber":"4570777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547461","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4570777","articleId":"4570782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4570784,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Irturk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Irturk","id":"37540503400"},{"name":"Bridget Benson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bridget","lastName":"Benson","id":"37391583200"},{"name":"Shahnam Mirzaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shahnam","lastName":"Mirzaei","id":"37691148200"},{"name":"Ryan Kastner","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kastner","id":"37266396600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2333-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2334-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4570784","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":533},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Space exploration","Wireless communication","Design optimization","Matrix decomposition","Throughput","OFDM","MIMO","Resource management","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","matrix inversion","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA design space exploration tool","matrix inversion core generator tool","wireless communication systems","GUSTO","optimized application specific architecture"]}],"abstract":"Matrix inversion is a common function found in many algorithms used in wireless communication systems.

NAND Flash memory is one of the most popular storage solutions for this purpose. However, an extremely long access latency makes the NAND flash memory less attractive in the domain of code storage solutions. In this paper, we introduce a highly effective cache system which utilizes application specific HotSpot information and a HotSpot-aware prefetching technique to effectively hide the long latency of the NAND flash memory based code storage systems. To lessen the negative impact of the extremely long access latency, we propose a page prefetching algorithm utilizing HotSpot information which provides a temporal distance sufficient to load a page from the physical NAND flash memory. The experimental results show that our proposed architecture exhibits up to 96% reduction of the average access time, and the juxtaposition of the HotSpot cache and the HotSpot-aware prefetching demonstrates enhancement by nearly two orders of magnitude, up to 98.3% reduction in time, over a basic direct mapped L1 cache architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076745","htmlLink":"/document/4570788/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application Specific Low Latency Instruction Cache for NAND Flash Memory Based Embedded Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application Specific Low Latency Instruction Cache for NAND Flash Memory Based Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SASP08-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039725S","chronDate":"8-9 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547461","isNumber":"4570777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547461","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4570777","articleId":"4570788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570789,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Palermo","id":"37391879400"},{"name":"Cristina Silvano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Silvano","id":"37295776300"},{"name":"Vittorio Zaccaria","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Zaccaria","id":"37326028900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2333-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2334-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4570789","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Space exploration","Constraint optimization","Design optimization","System-on-a-chip","Time to market","Energy consumption","Delay","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Response surface methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","design of experiments","multiprocessing systems","multiprocessor interconnection networks","Pareto optimisation","response surface methodology","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient design space exploration methodology","onchip multiprocessors","application-specific constraints","multiprocessor system on-chip architectures","time-to-market constraints","performance constraints","power consumption constraints","application-specific MPSoC","multi-objective optimization problem","memory hierarchy","interconnection network","Pareto front","design of experiments","response surface modeling"]}],"abstract":"Multi-processor system on-chip (MPSoC) architectures represent an emerging paradigm for developing customized, application specific solutions meeting time-to-market, performance and power consumption constraints. Application-specific MPSoCs are usually designed by using a platform-based approach, where a wide range of customizable parameters must be tuned to find the best trade-offs in terms of the selected figures of merit (such as energy, delay and area). This optimization phase is called design space exploration (DSE) and it generally consists of a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with multiple constraints. The design space for an application-specific MPSoC architecture consists of several parameters, mainly related to micro-architecture, memory hierarchy, and interconnection network. The total amount of possible architecture configurations is too large to be comprehensively evaluated. So far, several heuristic techniques have been proposed to address the DSE problem for MPSoC, but they are not efficient in handling constraints and identifying the Pareto front. In this paper, an efficient DSE methodology for application-specific MPSoC is proposed. The methodology combines design of experiments (DoEs) and response surface modeling (RSM) techniques to a new technique for handling system-level constraints. First, the DoE phase generates an initial plan of experiments used to create a coarse view of the target design space. Then, a set of RSM techniques are used to refine the exploration by exploiting application-specific constraints to identify the maximum number of feasible solutions. To trade-off accuracy and efficiency of the proposed techniques, a set of experimental results with actual workloads are reported in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2008.4570789","publicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547461/4570777/04570789.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2008.4570789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570777","startPage":"75","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Design Space Exploration Methodology for On-Chip Multiprocessors Subject to Application-Specific Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Design Space Exploration Methodology for On-Chip Multiprocessors Subject to Application-Specific Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570789/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076746","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570789/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Design Space Exploration Methodology for On-Chip Multiprocessors Subject to Application-Specific Constraints","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SASP08-00-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075121S","chronDate":"8-9 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547461","isNumber":"4570777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547461","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4570777","articleId":"4570789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4570790,"authors":[{"name":"Tohru Ishihara","affiliation":["System LSI Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tohru","lastName":"Ishihara","id":"37292362000"},{"name":"Seiichiro Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichiro","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37418276800"},{"name":"Yuriko Ishitobi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuriko","lastName":"Ishitobi","id":"37945528200"},{"name":"Tadayuki Matsumura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadayuki","lastName":"Matsumura","id":"38082018800"},{"name":"Yuji Kunitake","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Kunitake","id":"37298440600"},{"name":"Yuichiro Oyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichiro","lastName":"Oyama","id":"38096652500"},{"name":"Yusuke Kaneda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Kaneda","id":"38084991400"},{"name":"Masanori Muroyama","affiliation":["System LSI Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Muroyama","id":"37087262945"},{"name":"Toshinori Sato","affiliation":["System LSI Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinori","lastName":"Sato","id":"38540439800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2333-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2334-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4570790","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Clocks","Energy consumption","Costs","Dynamic voltage scaling","Frequency","Embedded system","Cache memory","Scheduling algorithm","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","clocks","embedded systems","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multi-performance processor","low-energy embedded applications","energy efficient processor","embedded system design","processing element cores","selective set-associative cache memory","clock gating","signal gating techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570790","abstract":"This paper proposes an energy efficient processor which can be used as a design alternative for the dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) processors in embedded system design. The processor consists of multiple PE (processing element) cores and a selective set-associative cache memory. The PE-cores have the same instruction set architecture but differ in their clock speeds and energy consumptions. Only a single PE-core is activated at a time and the other PE-cores are deactivated using clock gating and signal gating techniques. The major advantage over the DVS processors is a small overhead for changing its performance. The gate-level simulation demonstrates that our processor can change its performance within 1.5 microsecond and dissipates about 10 nanojoule while conventional DVS processors need hundreds of microseconds and dissipate a few microjoule for the performance transition (Shin et al., Oct. 2005) (Allah et al., April 2007) .","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2008.4570790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2008.4570790","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547461/4570777/04570790.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMPLE: An Adaptive Multi-Performance Processor for Low-Energy Embedded Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"AMPLE: An Adaptive Multi-Performance Processor for Low-Energy Embedded Applications","conferenceDate":"8-9 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4570790/","accessionNumber":"10076747","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570790/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AMPLE: An Adaptive Multi-Performance Processor for Low-Energy Embedded Applications","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SASP08-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060414S","chronDate":"8-9 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547461","isNumber":"4570777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547461","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4570777","articleId":"4570790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4570793,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Che","affiliation":["Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Che","id":"37586051700"},{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Li","id":"37405665000"},{"name":"Jeremy W.

Two extreme endpoints in the spectrum of possible accelerators are FPGAs and GPUs, which can often achieve better performance than CPUs on certain workloads. FPGAs are highly customizable, while GPUs provide massive parallel execution resources and high memory bandwidth. Applications typically exhibit vastly different performance characteristics depending on the accelerator. This is an inherent problem attributable to architectural design, middleware support and programming style of the target platform. For the best application-to-accelerator mapping, factors such as programmability, performance, programming cost and sources of overhead in the design flows must be all taken into consideration. In general, FPGAs provide the best expectation of performance, flexibility and low overhead, while GPUs tend to be easier to program and require less hardware resources. We present a performance study of three diverse applications - Gaussian elimination, data encryption standard (DES), and Needleman-Wunsch - on an FPGA, a GPU and a multicore CPU system. We perform a comparative study of application behavior on accelerators considering performance and code complexity. Based on our results, we present an application characteristic to accelerator platform mapping, which can aid developers in selecting an appropriate target architecture for their chosen application.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2008.4570793","publicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547461/4570777/04570793.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2008.4570793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Compute-Intensive Applications with GPUs and FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Compute-Intensive Applications with GPUs and FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570793/","accessionNumber":"10076750","publicationDate":"June 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Compute-Intensive Applications with GPUs and FPGAs","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SASP08-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092637S","chronDate":"8-9 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547461","isNumber":"4570777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547461","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4570777","articleId":"4570793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4570794,"authors":[{"name":"Josef Spjut","affiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Spjut","id":"37587041600"},{"name":"Solomon Boulos","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Solomon","lastName":"Boulos","id":"37660811800"},{"name":"Daniel Kopta","affiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Kopta","id":"37587039000"},{"name":"Erik Brunvand","affiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Brunvand","id":"37352432500"},{"name":"Spencer Kellis","affiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"],"firstName":"Spencer","lastName":"Kellis","id":"38512743000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2333-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2334-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4570794","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Computer architecture","Yarn","Layout","Computer graphics","Multicore processing","Read-write memory","Image databases","Games","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-threading","ray tracing","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TRaX","multithreaded architecture","real-time ray tracing","computer graphics image","multicore processor architecture","Threaded Ray eXecution","programmable interconnect","memory system","data delivery","image-based texture","memory bandwidth","frequency 500 MHz"]}],"abstract":"Ray tracing is a technique used for generating highly realistic computer graphics images. In this paper, we explore the design of a simple but extremely parallel, multi-threaded, multi-core processor architecture that performs real-time ray tracing. Our architecture, called TRaX for Threaded Ray eXecution, consists of a set of thread states that include commonly used functional units for each thread and share large functional units through a programmable interconnect to maximize utilization. The memory system takes advantage of the application's read-only access to the scene database and write-only access to the frame buffer output to provide efficient data delivery with a relatively simple structure. Preliminary results indicate that a multi-core version of the architecture running at a modest speed of 500 MHz already provides real-time ray traced images for scenes of a complexity found in video games. We also explore the architectural impact of a ray tracer that uses procedural (computed) textures rather than image-based (look-up) textures to trade computation for reduced memory bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2008.4570794","publicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547461/4570777/04570794.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2008.4570794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570777","startPage":"108","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRaX: A Multi-Threaded Architecture for Real-Time Ray Tracing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TRaX: A Multi-Threaded Architecture for Real-Time Ray Tracing","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570794/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076751","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570794/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TRaX: A Multi-Threaded Architecture for Real-Time Ray Tracing","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SASP08-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070081S","chronDate":"8-9 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547461","isNumber":"4570777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547461","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4570777","articleId":"4570794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4570796,"authors":[{"name":"Xingdong Dai","affiliation":["LSI Corporation, Allentown, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xingdong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37655923100"},{"name":"Meghanad D.

For the purpose of copyright protection, the watermarks are embedded into the halftone image with visually transparency by the variety of dither arrays, robust to malicious attacks and counterfeits. And for the purpose of content authentication, the areas with malicious attacks could be detected and localized by fragile watermarks. In the system, the geometric invariance method, multi-rings Zernike transform (MRZT)containing co-centric rings sub-sampling and the clustering method, are adopted to estimate the angle and scaling factor accurately and achieve geometric invariance.

The nonlinear buckling phenomenon is combined with the nonlinear change in flow rate through parallel plates with a variable spacing. The thermal buckling mechanism and parallel plate flow are modeled analytically, and nondimensional characteristic design curves have been generated. Passive flow-control microvalves were fabricated using deep reactive ion etching and a through-mold nickel electroplating process over a thin sacrificial layer. The model is validated with experimental results from the microfabricated temperature-regulated microvalves. Experimental characterization using an integrated micromachined heat exchanger with air as the working fluid shows the desired nonlinear valving behavior with mass flow rates of up to 5 mg/s for a temperature increase of 50degC, corresponding to 0.25 W of heat removal. It is shown that temperature-induced elastic instabilities in microfabricated structures can be modeled and manipulated to create a nonlinear adaptive valving mechanism. The modeling approach, microfabrication process, and full characterization of the microvalves are presented.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2008.927742","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4585407/04570967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2008.927742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4585407","startPage":"998","endPage":"1009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature-Regulated Nonlinear Microvalves for Self-Adaptive MEMS Cooling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temperature-Regulated Nonlinear Microvalves for Self-Adaptive MEMS Cooling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10178051","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570967/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-Regulated Nonlinear Microvalves for Self-Adaptive MEMS Cooling","sourcePdf":"17jmems04-mccarthy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090716S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4585407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4585407","articleId":"4570967","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4570973,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The demand for low voltage, low power and high performance are the great challenges for engineering of sub 50 nm gate length CMOS devices. Functional CMOS devices in the range of 5 nm channel length have been demonstrated. The alternative architectures allowing to increase devices drivability and reduce power are reviewed through the issues to address in gate/channel and substrate, gate dielectric as well as source and drain engineering. HiK gate dielectric and metal gate are among the most strategic options to consider for power consumption and low supply voltage management. It will be very difficult to compete with CMOS logic because of the low series resistance required to obtain high performance. By introducing new materials (Ge, diamond/graphite carbon, HiK,...), Si based CMOS will be scaled beyond the ITRS as the future system-on-chip Platform integrating new disruptive devices. The association of C-diamond with HiK as a combination for new functionalized Buried Insulators, for example, wi ll bring new ways of improving short channel effects and suppress self-heating. That will allow new optimization of Ion-Ioff trade offs. The control of low power dissipation and short channel effects together with high performance w ll be the major challenges in the future.","doi":"10.1109/IWNC.2006.4570973","publicationTitle":"2006 International Workshop on Nano CMOS","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Workshop on Nano CMOS","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562242/4570968/04570973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWNC.2006.4570973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4570968","startPage":"13","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NanoCMOS devices at the end and beyond the roadmap","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4570973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NanoCMOS devices at the end and beyond the roadmap","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2006-Feb. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4570973/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"10089987","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4570973/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NanoCMOS devices at the end and beyond the roadmap","confLoc":"Mishima, Japan","sourcePdf":"013_deleonibus.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128612S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2006-Feb. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4562242","isNumber":"4570968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562242","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4570968","articleId":"4570973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4571019,"authors":[{"name":"Bart Jansen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Jansen","id":"37285450800"},{"name":"Rudi Deklerck","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Rudi","lastName":"Deklerck","id":"37273637900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-963-9799-15-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1633"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1641"}],"articleNumber":"4571019","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Cameras","Biomedical monitoring","Position measurement","Senior citizens","Remote monitoring","Temperature sensors","Biomedical imaging","Consumer electronics","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","geriatrics","graphical user interfaces","least squares approximations","medical image processing","patient monitoring","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi automatic 3D camera image calibration algorithm","patient home monitoring","least square manner","semiautomatic ground floor detection","graphical user interface","elder people"]}],"abstract":"A major practical problem when implementing home monitoring using 3D camera technology is the calibration process which serves to relate the camera coordinate system to a coordinate system interpretable by the caregiver. In this paper, we propose a calibration algorithm which can relate both coordinate systems without performing actual measurements of the position of reference points in the room. The calibration tool is constructed such that it can be operated by any caregiver and hence eases the deployment of the home monitoring appliances. Our method (semi)automatically detects a plane corresponding to the ground floor in the three dimensional images. Random points from that plane are used to calculate rotation angles in a least squares manner. Experiments are performed to investigate how the obtained results depend on the parameters of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/PCTHEALTH.2008.4571019","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562769/4571002/04571019.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCTHEALTH.2008.4571019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4571002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-automatic calibration of 3D camera images \u2014 Monitoring activities made easy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4571019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4571019/","displayDocTitle":"Semi-automatic calibration of 3D camera images \u2014 Monitoring activities made easy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10090015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4571019/","conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-automatic calibration of 3D camera images \u2014 Monitoring activities made easy","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"017 paper2796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094142S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562769","isNumber":"4571002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562769","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4571002","articleId":"4571019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4571106,"authors":[{"name":"Tonse Laxminidhi","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4782044/4571106/4571106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tonse Laxminidhi was born in Udupi, India, in 1975.

In this paper, we propose two methods for automating the construction of algorithms that efficiently implement such structures, starting from their symbolic description. The former is based on the solution of state-space equations, while the latter is based on direct structural inspection. The state-space approach starts from the blockwise construction of a tableau matrix for the direct implementation of a generic WD structure and, for this reason, is here referred to as the wave tableau (WT) method. It has very general applicability as it works for a generic WD structure. The second technique (binary connection tree) implements a WD structure through a direct inspection (scanning) of the treelike topological representation of the reference model. Although valid for a slightly less general range of cases, this approach turns out to be much more efficient and flexible than that of the WT method. Such methods are particularly interesting for an interactive and immediate prototyping of physical models for the synthesis of sounds as they bring nonlinear WD structures with dynamic adaptors to a level of practical usability for a wide range of users while enabling the modeling of a wide variety of time-varying nonlinear physical models in an automatic fashion. The proposed solutions have been extensively tested on applications for the automatic modeling of acoustic interactions of musical interest.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Methods for the Implementation of Nonlinear Wave-Digital Structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2001801","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4782044/04571108.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2001801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4571108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4571108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Methods for the Implementation of Nonlinear Wave-Digital Structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4571108/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10478721","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Methods for the Implementation of Nonlinear Wave-Digital Structures","sourcePdf":"tcsi-asarti-2001801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111017S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4782044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4782044","articleId":"4571108","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4571109,"authors":[{"name":"You Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4694051/4571109/4571109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["You Zheng (S'03) received the B.Sc. degree in radio physics from Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China in 2000, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Queens University, Kingston, ON, Canada in 2004 and 2008, respectively."]},"firstName":"You","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37281050500"},{"name":"Carlos E.

This scheme is scalable and suitable for transferring data across different clock domains such as those in \"many-core\" SoCs and in 3-D ICs. SSMCB replaces intermediate flip-flops by a source-synchronous synchronization scheme. Removing the intermediate flip-flops in the SSMCB scheme enables better averaging of delay variations across the whole interconnect, which reduces bit-rate degradation due to within-die process variations. Monte Carlo circuit simulations show that SSMCB eliminates 90% of the variation-induced performance degradation in a six-cycle 9-mm-long 16-bit conventional bus. The proposed multicycle bus scheme also leads to significant energy savings due to the elimination of power-hungry flip-flops and the efficient design of the source synchronization overhead. Moreover, eliminating the intermediate flip-flops avoids the timing overhead of the setup time, the flip-flop delay, and the single-cycle clock jitter. This delay slack can then be translated into further energy savings by downsizing the repeaters. The significant delay jitter due to capacitive coupling has been addressed, and solutions are put forward to alleviate it. Circuit simulations in a 65-nm process environment indicate that energy savings up to 20% are achievable for a six-cycle 9-mm-long 16-bit bus.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2001805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2001805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4782044/04571113.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSMCB: Low-Power Variation-Tolerant Source-Synchronous Multicycle Bus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4571113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"SSMCB: Low-Power Variation-Tolerant Source-Synchronous Multicycle Bus","volume":"56","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10478729","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4571113/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSMCB: Low-Power Variation-Tolerant Source-Synchronous Multicycle Bus","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mghoneima-2001805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09077S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4782044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4782044","articleId":"4571113","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4571117,"authors":[{"name":"John A.

The two independent outputs are averaged to produce the ADC output code. The difference of the two outputs provides information for a background-calibration algorithm. Since both ADCs convert the same input, when correctly calibrated, their outputs should be equal, and the difference should be zero. Any nonzero difference provides information to an error-estimation algorithm, which adjusts digital-calibration parameters in an adaptive process similar to a least mean square algorithm. This paper describes the calibration algorithm implemented in the specific realization of a 16-bit 1-MS/s algorithmic cyclic ADC. In addition to correcting ADC linearity, the calibration and estimation algorithms are tolerant of offset error and remove linear scale-factor-error mismatch between the ADC channels. Simulated results are presented confirming self-calibration in approximately 10 000 conversions, which represents an improvement of four orders of magnitude over previous statistically based calibration algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4782044/04571117.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2001830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2001830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4571117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Background-Calibration Algorithm for \u201cSplit ADC\u201d Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Least squares approximation","Algorithm design and analysis","Error correction","Signal design","Least mean square algorithms","Linearity","Circuit simulation","Analog integrated circuits","Digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","calibration","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital background-calibration algorithm","split ADC","error-estimation algorithm","least mean square algorithm","linear scale-factor- error mismatch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive systems","analog\u2013digital conversion","calibration","digital background calibration","mixed analog\u2013digital integrated circuits","self-calibrating"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4571117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Digital Background-Calibration Algorithm for \u201cSplit ADC\u201d Architecture","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4571117/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10478725","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Background-Calibration Algorithm for \u201cSplit ADC\u201d Architecture","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mcneill-2001830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077175S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4782044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4782044","articleId":"4571117","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4571118,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Adrian","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4782044/4571118/4571118-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Victor Adrian received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.Phil. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2003 and 2004, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.","He was a Project Officer with NTU from 2004 to 2005.

RTN is shown to introduce exponential tails in the distribution of the threshold voltage variation between two subsequent read operations on the cells. Tail height is shown to increase as a function of the stress levels, with a larger relative increase for the NAND case. The slope of the distribution instead remains nearly independent of the number of applied P/E cycles. This reveals that trap generation takes place according to the native trap distribution over the active area and means that the tail slope is a basic RTN parameter, depending on the cell process details for a fixed technology. These results are important for the design of the threshold voltage levels in multilevel nor and NAND technologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4571155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","volume":"29","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10118040","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4571155/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cycling Effect on the Random Telegraph Noise Instabilities of <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nor</emphasis> and <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cycling Effect on the Random Telegraph Noise Instabilities of <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nor</emphasis> and <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Arrays","sourcePdf":"led-monziocompagnoni-2000964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061979S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4571121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4571121","articleId":"4571155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4571213,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The presented system, called Basset (Bayesian system for intrusion detection) extends functionality of Snort, an open-source NIDS, by incorporating Bayesian networks as additional processing stages. The flexible nature of this solution allows it to be used both for misuse-based and anomaly-based detection process; this paper concentrates on the anomaly-based detection. The ultimate goal is to create a hybrid, misuse anomaly based solution that will allow interaction between these two techniques of intrusion detection. Ability to alter its behaviour based on historical data is also an important feature of the described system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Dependability of Computer Systems DepCoS-RELCOMEX","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573022/4573023/04573059.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"218","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Dependability of Computer Systems DepCoS-RELCOMEX","doi":"10.1109/DepCoS-RELCOMEX.2008.52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DepCoS-RELCOMEX.2008.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4573023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4573059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection Using Bayesian Networks","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","computer networks","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly-based intrusion detection","Bayesian networks","computer networks","open-source NIDS","misuse-based detection process;","anomaly-based detection process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intrusion detection","anomaly detection","Bayesian networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4573059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection Using Bayesian Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4573059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10090245","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection Using Bayesian Networks","confLoc":"Szklarska Poreba, Poland","sourcePdf":"3179a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035484S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573022","isNumber":"4573023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573022","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4573023","articleId":"4573059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4573071,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Babeshko","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems and Networks, National Aerospace University, N.E.

In this paper we qualitatively evaluate how current approaches to model-based schedulability analysis may employ and feed state-of-the-art analysis equations; we then illustrate a new strategy which, by way of model transformation, warrants a high degree of confidence in and permits an iterative refinement of the input to sophisticated analysis equations.

The memory channel is shared by a mix of streams with timing requirements at different levels. The streams are arbitrated in the memory access network. Some streams have to meet a hard deadline for each transaction; other streams have to meet task-level execution-time constraints, where task execution times depend on the service received when performing memory accesses. Earlier work has resulted in arbitration algorithms that provide the necessary balance between the different stream types, allowing aggressive system design with a high utilization of the memory access path. The next challenge is to provide real-time analysis in an early stage of system design. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a practical approach that combines proven analytical methods with fast simulations. The approach provides a design space from which to choose arbiter settings and buffer sizes for memory-communication buffers.","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2008.36","publicationTitle":"2008 Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573089/4573090/04573121.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2008.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4573090","startPage":"255","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Analysis for Memory Access in Media Processing SoCs: A Practical Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4573121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Analysis for Memory Access in Media Processing SoCs: A Practical Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4573121/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10090295","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4573121/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Analysis for Memory Access in Media Processing SoCs: A Practical Approach","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"3298a255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074935S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573089","isNumber":"4573090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573089","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4573090","articleId":"4573121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4573124,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoung-Don Kang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Binghamton, USA"],"firstName":"Kyoung-Don","lastName":"Kang","id":"37279668600"},{"name":"Jisu Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Binghamton, USA"],"firstName":"Jisu","lastName":"Oh","id":"37292052000"},{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Binghamton, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37532952200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3298-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-3070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5998"}],"articleNumber":"4573124","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4573124","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","transaction processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backlog estimation","real-time data services management","data-intensive real-time applications","e-commerce","transaction processing","stock prices","real-time data service quality","database backlog estimation","fine-grained closed-loop admission control","hint-based incoming load smoothing","feedback-based admission control","workload smoothing","stock trading database testbed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["real-time data services","backlog","response time","feedback control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2008.11","publicationTitle":"2008 Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573089/4573090/04573124.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2008.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4573090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backlog Estimation and Management for Real-Time Data Services","abstract":"Real-time data services can benefit data-intensive real-time applications, e.g., e-commerce, via timely transaction processing using fresh data, e.g., the current stock prices.

To extract the normal behavior from the activities of a user, conventional data mining techniques are widely applied to a finite audit data set. However, these approaches can only model the static behavior of a user in the audit data set. This drawback can be overcome by viewing the continuous activities of a user as an audit data stream. This paper proposes an anomaly detection method that continuously models the normal behavior of a user over the multi-dimensional audit data stream. Each cluster represents the frequent range of the activities with respect to a set of features.

At the same time, various statistics of the activities related to the identified clusters are additionally modeled to improve the performance of anomaly detection.

For this verification, we employ a determinant-based simple transmit antenna selection approach based on the estimated instantaneous MIMO channel matrix. We show extensive experiments on the testbed to confirm the performance of eigenbeam MIMO-OFDM with transmit antenna selection in the three-select-two antenna case. First, the measured packet-error-rate (PER) performance confirms that the eigenbeam scheme with the three-select-two antenna-selection scheme provides a slight degradation in the required carrier-to-noise power ratio (CNR) that is approximately 0.2 dB from the eigenbeam-only scheme with three transmit antennas but with significantly lower computational complexity. Second, to determine the impact of Doppler frequency, both 5 Hz and 20 Hz, we focus on the required CNR performance degradation under various transmission intervals between the channel sounding packet and the data packet. It is experimentally confirmed that the eigenbeam scheme with transmit antenna selection offers improved robustness to MIMO channel fluctuation compared with the eigenbeam-only scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments on FPGA-Implemented Eigenbeam MIMO-OFDM With Transmit Antenna Selection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.928900","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4802057/04573258.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.928900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4573258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4573258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Experiments on FPGA-Implemented Eigenbeam MIMO-OFDM With Transmit Antenna Selection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4573258/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10520134","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments on FPGA-Implemented Eigenbeam MIMO-OFDM With Transmit Antenna Selection","sourcePdf":"58tvt03-onizawa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080985S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4802057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4802057","articleId":"4573258","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4573259,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Shah-Mansouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4802057/4573259/4573259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vahid Shah-Mansouri (S'02) received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, in 2003 and 2005, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

As the size of the WSNs increases, it becomes inefficient (in terms of power consumption) when gathering all information in a single sink. To tackle this problem, one can increase the number of sinks. The set of sensor nodes that are sending data to sink \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n is called commodity \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n. In this paper, we formulate the lexicographically optimal commodity lifetime (LOCL) routing problem. A stepwise centralized algorithm called the LOCL algorithm is proposed, which can obtain the optimal routing solution and lead to lexicographical fairness among commodity lifetimes. We then show that, under certain assumptions, the lexicographical optimality among commodity lifetimes can be achieved by providing lexicographical optimality among node lifetimes. This motivates us to propose our second algorithm, which is called the lexicographically optimal node lifetime (LONL) algorithm, which is suitable for practical implementation. Simulation results show that our proposed LOCL and LONL algorithms increase the normalized commodity and node lifetimes compared with the maximum lifetime with multiple sinks (MLMS) and lexicographical max-min fair (LMM) routing algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.928898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4802057/04573259.pdf","endPage":"1500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lexicographically Optimal Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks With Multiple Sinks","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.928898","startPage":"1490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4573259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Lexicographically Optimal Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks With Multiple Sinks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4573259/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10520130","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4573259/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lexicographically Optimal Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks With Multiple Sinks","sourcePdf":"58tvt03-shahmansouri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087822S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4802057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4802057","articleId":"4573259","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4573261,"authors":[{"name":"Uichin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4783256/4573261/4573261-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Uichin Lee is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Computer Science, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA).","His research interests include mobile wireless sensor networks (e.g., vehicular/underwater sensors), delay-tolerant networks, and wireless vehicular applications."]},"firstName":"Uichin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37288063900"},{"name":"Eugenio Magistretti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4783256/4573261/4573261-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Eugenio Magistretti received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.

In particular, there is an increasing interest in proactive urban monitoring, where vehicles continuously sense events from urban streets, autonomously process sensed data (e.g., recognizing license plates), and, possibly, route messages to vehicles in their vicinity to achieve a common goal (e.g., to allow police agents to track the movements of specified cars). This challenging environment requires novel solutions with respect to those of more-traditional wireless sensor nodes. In fact, unlike conventional sensor nodes, vehicles exhibit constrained mobility, have no strict limits on processing power and storage capabilities, and host sensors that may generate sheer amounts of data, thus making already-known solutions for sensor network data reporting inapplicable. This paper describes MobEyes, which is an effective middleware that was specifically designed for proactive urban monitoring and exploits node mobility to opportunistically diffuse sensed data summaries among neighbor vehicles and to create a low-cost index to query monitoring data. We have thoroughly validated the original MobEyes protocols and demonstrated their effectiveness in terms of indexing completeness, harvesting time, and overhead. In particular, this paper includes (1) analytic models for MobEyes protocol performance and their consistency with simulation-based results, (2) evaluation of performance as a function of vehicle mobility, (3) effects of concurrent exploitation of multiple harvesting agents with single/multihop communications, (4) evaluation of network overhead and overall system stability, and (5) performance validation of MobEyes in a challenging urban tracking application where the police reconstruct the movements of a suspicious driver, e.g., by specifying the license number of a car.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.928899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","startPage":"882","endPage":"901","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04573261.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dissemination and Harvesting of Urban Data Using Vehicular Sensing Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4573261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4573261/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dissemination and Harvesting of Urban Data Using Vehicular Sensing Platforms","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475146","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dissemination and Harvesting of Urban Data Using Vehicular Sensing Platforms","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-ulee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113138S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4573261","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4573263,"authors":[{"name":"Yinman Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4802057/4573263/4573263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yinman Lee (M'06) was born in Hong Kong.

For the classical three-node cooperation model, the exact SER expressions for both M phase shift keying (PSK) and M quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) are derived. For easy usage, we also provide asymptotic approximations for the SER. In the analysis, we first consider the cooperation scenario in which all the channels are uncorrelated. In practice, it may happen that a correlation exists between the source-destination and relay-destination channels, e.g., for user cooperation in the uplink of a cellular network. We then examine the SER in this scenario. In addition, by varying the parameters of the Nakagami-m fading channels in the analytical results, we obtain some perceptions of choosing a good relay for enhancing the cooperation and make clear about how the included Nakagami fading figures and channel variances affect the SER performance. In addition, the optimal power allocation is investigated based on the derived asymptotic SER expressions. Simulations are finally provided to verify the correctness of our analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.928907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4802057/04573263.pdf","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.928907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Communications Over Nakagami- - Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4573263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Communications Over Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4573263/","accessionNumber":"10520131","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Communications Over Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"58tvt03-ylee2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09193S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4802057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4802057","articleId":"4573263","onlineDate":"22 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4574585,"authors":[{"name":"Hongki Kang","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hongki","lastName":"Kang","id":"38087760200"},{"name":"Jin-Woo Han","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin-Woo","lastName":"Han","id":"37290383700"},{"name":"Yang-Kyu Choi","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yang-Kyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277373300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4574585","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":913},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4574585","abstract":"An analytical threshold voltage model for double-gate MOSFETs with localized charges is developed.

An experiment including exercise was conducted on twelve subjects. The results show that estimation with PTT and a new parameter, i.e. the Relative Amplitude of Secondary peak (RAS), can predict SBP within 1.7 plusmn 6.8 mmHg of the reference for all the subjects before and after exercise (including within 5 minutes and 20-40 minutes after exercise). The underestimated bias after exercise if PTT was used alone can be largely reduced when RAS is introduced.

In this work we describe first a method for monitoring and modeling of performance degradation in SOA applications, particularly application servers. This method works for a large class of the aging processes caused by resource depletion (e.g. memory leaks). It can be deployed non-intrusively in a production environment, under arbitrary service request distributions. Based on this schema we investigate in the second part of the paper how machine learning (classification) algorithms can be used for proactive detection of performance degradation or sudden drops caused by aging. We leverage the predictive power of these algorithms with several techniques to make the measurement-based aging models more adaptive and more robust against transient failures. We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented with a memory leak injector. The results show that the probing method yields accurate aging models with low overhead and the machine learning approach gives statistically significant short-term predictions of degrading application performance. Both approaches can be used directly to fight aging via adaptive software rejuvenation (restart of the application), for operator alerting, or for short-term capacity planning.","doi":"10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575113","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567164/4575087/04575113.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","publicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4575087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using machine learning for non-intrusive modeling and prediction of software aging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4575113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Using machine learning for non-intrusive modeling and prediction of software aging","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178503","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4575113/","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using machine learning for non-intrusive modeling and prediction of software aging","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"TS01_04_35015.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058287S","chronDate":"7-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567164","isNumber":"4575087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567164","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4575087","articleId":"4575113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4575128,"authors":[{"name":"Quoc-Thinh Nguyen-Vuong","affiliation":["Networks and Multimedia Systems Research Group, ENSIIE and University of Evry, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Quoc-Thinh","lastName":"Nguyen-Vuong","id":"38315934500"},{"name":"Yacine Ghamri-Doudane","affiliation":["Networks and Multimedia Systems Research Group, ENSIIE and University of Evry, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Yacine","lastName":"Ghamri-Doudane","id":"38270773200"},{"name":"Nazim Agoulmine","affiliation":["Networks and Multimedia Systems Research Group, ENSIIE and University of Evry, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Nazim","lastName":"Agoulmine","id":"37279949700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2065-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2066-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1542-1201"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9709"}],"articleNumber":"4575128","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":122,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1338},"abstract":"ldquoAlways Best Connectedrdquo (ABC) is a fundamental and challenging dimension of the fourth generation heterogeneous wireless networks.

An alternative approach, application-layer signature mapping, involves the exhaustive search of reliable signatures but with more promising accuracy. With a prior protocol knowledge, the signature generation can guarantee a high accuracy. As more applications use proprietary protocols, it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain an accurate signature while avoiding time-consuming and manual signature generation process. This paper proposes an automated approach for generating application-level signature, the LASER algorithm, that does not need to be preceded by an analysis of application protocols. We show that our approach is as accurate and efficient as the approach that uses preceding application protocol analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4575130/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10178520","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4575130/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Towards automated application signature generation for traffic identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards automated application signature generation for traffic identification","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"TS06_01_34902.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055087S","chronDate":"7-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567164","isNumber":"4575087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567164","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4575087","articleId":"4575130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4575137,"authors":[{"name":"Ningfang Mi","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ningfang","lastName":"Mi","id":"37603427400"},{"name":"Ludmila Cherkasova","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ludmila","lastName":"Cherkasova","id":"37273160800"},{"name":"Kivanc Ozonat","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kivanc","lastName":"Ozonat","id":"37424584100"},{"name":"Julie Symons","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Symons","id":"37430571400"},{"name":"Evgenia Smirni","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Evgenia","lastName":"Smirni","id":"37274625200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2065-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2066-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1542-1201"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9709"}],"articleNumber":"4575137","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Application software","Buildings","Web pages","Transaction databases","Software performance","Feedback","Production","Delay","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","digital signatures","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["representative application signatures","multitier architecture","client-server applications","request-reply transactions","Web page","cascading effects","request-reply transaction","software releases","application signature","transaction latency profiles","transaction signatures","software updates","anomaly detection","capacity planning","multitier applications","IT environments"]}],"abstract":"Application servers are a core component of a multi-tier architecture that has become the industry standard for building scalable client-server applications. A client communicates with a service deployed as a multi-tier application via request-reply transactions. A typical server reply consists of the Web page dynamically generated by the application server. The application server may issue multiple database calls while preparing the reply. Understanding the cascading effects of the various tasks that are sprung by a single request-reply transaction is a challenging task. Furthermore, significantly shortened time between new software releases further exacerbates the problem of thoroughly evaluating the performance of an updated application. We address the problem of efficiently diagnosing essential performance changes in application behavior in order to provide timely feedback to application designers and service providers. In this work, we propose a new approach based on an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">application</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">signature</i>\n that enables a quick performance comparison of the new application signature against the old one, while the application continues its execution in the production environment. The application signature is built based on new concepts that are introduced here, namely the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">transaction</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">latency</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">profiles</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">transaction</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">signatures</i>\n. These become instrumental for creating an application signature that accurately reflects important performance characteristics. We show that such an application signature is representative and stable under different workload characteristics. We also show that application signatures are robust as they effectively capture changes in transaction times that result from software updates. Application signatures provide a simple and powerful solution that can further be used for efficient capacity planning, anomaly detection, and provisioning of multi-tier applications in rapidly evolving IT environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of application performance and its change via representative application signatures","publicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","doi":"10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575137","displayPublicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567164/4575087/04575137.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4575087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4575137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4575137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of application performance and its change via representative application signatures","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4575137/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10178527","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of application performance and its change via representative application signatures","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"TS07_04_35204.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10896S","chronDate":"7-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567164","isNumber":"4575087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567164","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4575087","articleId":"4575137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4575169,"authors":[{"name":"Jianning Mai","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Jianning","lastName":"Mai","id":"37825400300"},{"name":"Lihua Yuan","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37305998000"},{"name":"Chen-Nee Chuah","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Chen-Nee","lastName":"Chuah","id":"37269487300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2065-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2066-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1542-1201"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9709"}],"articleNumber":"4575169","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Event detection","Routing protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Wavelet analysis","Pattern analysis","Signal analysis","Information analysis","Surges","Delay","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","routing protocols","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","BAlet","temporal localization","spatial localization","update traffic","wavelet analysis","routing traffic","network-wide anomalous event","border gateway protocol","BGP anomalies"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a BGP anomaly detection framework called BAlet that delivers both temporal and spatial localization of the potential anomalies. It requires only a simple count of BGP update messages collected over a certain period. We first investigate the self-similarity in BGP update traffic and present a quantitative validation. The strength of wavelet analysis in handling signals with scaling property and earlier success in applying it for network anomaly detection motivate us to apply the same technique on BGP routing traffic. Later by clustering the anomalies detected at different locations, BAlet is capable of identifying possible network-wide anomalous events. Our method does not rely on any information within the BGP messages, and serves as a complementary tool to reduce the candidate data set for further detailed root cause analysis. We evaluate BAlet on real BGP data sets that are known to contain anomalies. Results show that it is capable of detecting network-wide events such as message volume surges caused by slammer worm attack, and separating affected ASes from the rest.","doi":"10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575169","publicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567164/4575087/04575169.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4575087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting BGP anomalies with wavelet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4575169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4575169/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting BGP anomalies with wavelet","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10178559","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4575169/","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting BGP anomalies with wavelet","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"TS15_04_35150.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06947S","chronDate":"7-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567164","isNumber":"4575087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567164","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4575087","articleId":"4575169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4575199,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Bogaz Zarpelao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering(FEEC), State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Bruno Bogaz","lastName":"Zarpelao","id":"37392112000"},{"name":"Leonardo de Souza Mendes","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering(FEEC), State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"de Souza Mendes","id":"37356326500"},{"name":"Mario Lemes Proenca","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, State University of Londrina, Londrina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Mario Lemes","lastName":"Proenca","id":"37410457900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2065-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2066-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1542-1201"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9709"}],"articleNumber":"4575199","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Object detection","Protocols","Character generation","Monitoring","Computer crime","Optical propagation","Web server","Information management","Event detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","graph theory","security of data","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dependency graph","notification semantic","anomaly detection","network administrator","directed graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alarm systems","Anomaly detection","Computer network management","Traffic characterization"]}],"abstract":"Besides identifying anomalies, detection systems must offer additional information about the occurrence, aiming to help the network administrator in order to build an accurate diagnostic.

The paper also details our practical experiences applying the methodology to two quite different use cases: VNUML-based virtual testbeds and the GMPLS-enabled optical network of ADRENALINE testbed\u00ae (each one with its own model-based automatic deployment tools), thus assessing the feasibility and generality of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575204","startPage":"747","endPage":"750","displayPublicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567164/4575087/04575204.pdf","publicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4575087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model-driven configuration management methodology for testbed infrastructures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A model-driven configuration management methodology for testbed infrastructures","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4575204/","accessionNumber":"10178594","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4575204/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model-driven configuration management methodology for testbed infrastructures","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PS1_21_34896_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049723S","chronDate":"7-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567164","isNumber":"4575087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567164","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4575087","articleId":"4575204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4575207,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Popi","affiliation":["MADYNES INRIA Nancy Grand Est Research Center, Villers-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Popi","id":"37698146500"},{"name":"Olivier Festor","affiliation":["MADYNES INRIA Nancy Grand Est Research Center, Villers-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Festor","id":"37267053300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2065-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2066-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1542-1201"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9709"}],"articleNumber":"4575207","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Wireless mesh networks","Peer to peer computing","Merging","Condition monitoring","Ad hoc networks","Routing protocols","History","Information management","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","peer-to-peer computing","protocols","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network topology information","wireless mesh networks","distributed monitoring scheme","ad-hoc network topology","mesh network topology","distributed hash table","peer-to-peer system"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scheme for dynamic monitoring and logging of topology information in Wireless Mesh Networks","doi":"10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4575087","endPage":"762","publicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567164/4575087/04575207.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575207","startPage":"759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4575207","abstract":"We propose a distributed monitoring scheme for an ad-hoc/mesh network topology, and design a distributed hash table based peer-to-peer system to log the topology information.

Those IDSs basically work based on the misuse detection method, which monitors network and computers for known attack patterns. This article shows the build of a prototype for a network intrusion detection system, that uses an artificial neural network as a detection mechanism. In the network training and learning phases, which are an adaptive process, the knowledge base of IDS Snort was applied. The built IDSs allow the detection of an acceptable proportion of variants of intrusion, beyond the already known intrusion forms. This last characteristic presents expressive advantages comparing to intrusion detection systems purely based on rules, because it dismisses the use of an extensive knowledge base and solves the false negative and false positive problems, through the fine adjustment of weights, given by the variation of the acceptation rate in the network output, when the network is trained.","doi":"10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575234","startPage":"867","endPage":"870","displayPublicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567164/4575087/04575234.pdf","publicationTitle":"NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4575087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrusion detection through artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Computer networks","Monitoring","Packaging","Computer displays","Prototypes","Protection","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","knowledge based systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection","artificial neural network","network training","learning phase","adaptive process","knowledge base","IDS Snort"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4575234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Intrusion detection through artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4575234/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 2008","accessionNumber":"10178448","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrusion detection through artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PS3_07_35023_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05161S","chronDate":"7-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567164","isNumber":"4575087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567164","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4575087","articleId":"4575234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4575235,"authors":[{"name":"John McGlone","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McGlone","id":"37573088900"},{"name":"Alan Marshall","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Marshall","id":"37278176400"},{"name":"Roger Woods","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Woods","id":"37271861100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2065-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2066-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1542-1201"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9709"}],"articleNumber":"4575235","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Computer architecture","Telecommunication traffic","Field programmable gate arrays","Internet","IP networks","Computer networks","Statistics","Fluid flow measurement","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","field programmable gate arrays","Internet","statistical analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time flow monitor architecture","ondemand monitoring functions","flow monitoring architecture","FPGA technology","next generation Internet","Internet traffic characteristics","network statistics","ondemand monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IP flow monitoring","monitoring functions","FPGA","on-demand"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new flow monitoring architecture that is based on FPGA technology offering high speed and programmability for monitoring in the next generation Internet.

The proposed approach exploits the prediction residue correlation between consecutive spatial layers. In enhancement-layer motion compensation, it selects the method with the lowest rate-distortion (RD) cost from three schemes: pyramid motion compensation, subband motion compensation, and encoding the enhancement layer with no base-layer information. To reduce the block artifacts of the enhancement-layer prediction used in the subband method, extended edge prediction is introduced in the proposed approach. Compared with the current scalable H.264/AVC extension (SVC) motion-compensation scheme, our experimental results show that the proposed method exploits the redundancy between the base layer and the enhancement layer more efficiently and hence improves the coding performance. It achieves an improvement up to about 1dB in the enhancement-layer encoding for different coding parameters and video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.928880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4660351/04577634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.928880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660351","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Inter-Layer Motion Compensation for Spatially Scalable Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4577634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Inter-Layer Motion Compensation for Spatially Scalable Video Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4577634/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301292","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4577634/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Inter-Layer Motion Compensation for Spatially Scalable Video Coding","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt10-zhang-928880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072257S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4660351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4660351","articleId":"4577634","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4577635,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Egorov","affiliation":["Artann Laboratories, Inc., Trenton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Egorov","id":"37408712600"},{"name":"Armen P.

The method entitled mechanical imaging is implemented in the breast mechanical imager (BMI), a compact device consisting of a hand held probe equipped with a pressure sensor array, a compact electronic unit, and a touchscreen laptop computer. Data acquired by the BMI allows calculation of size, shape, consistency/hardness, and mobility of detected lesions. The BMI prototype has been validated in laboratory experiments on tissue models and in an ongoing clinical study. The obtained results prove that the BMI has potential to become a screening and diagnostic tool that could largely supplant clinical breast examination through its higher sensitivity, quantitative record storage, ease-of-use, and inherent low cost.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.922192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4608888/04577635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.922192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608888","startPage":"1275","endPage":"1287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanical Imaging of the Breast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4577635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mechanical Imaging of the Breast","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4577635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185699","pubMedId":"18753043","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4577635/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical Imaging of the Breast","sourcePdf":"27tmi09-egorov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116018S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4608888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4608888","articleId":"4577635","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4577690,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Afonso","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Electronics, University of Minho, Guimaraes, Portugal"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Afonso","id":"37297762000"},{"name":"Carlos Silva","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Electronics, University of Minho, Guimaraes, Portugal"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Silva","id":"37289574700"},{"name":"Adriano Tavares","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Electronics, University of Minho, Guimaraes, Portugal"],"firstName":"Adriano","lastName":"Tavares","id":"37297488200"},{"name":"Sergio Montenegro","affiliation":["Compact Satellite Project, German Space Agency (DRL), Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Montenegro","id":"37281818700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1994-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1995-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3109"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3117"}],"articleNumber":"4577690","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerant systems","Real time systems","Embedded system","Hardware","Fault tolerance","Embedded software","Redundancy","Application software","Operating systems","Middleware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","fault tolerant computing","middleware","multi-threading","operating systems (computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-level fault tolerance techniques","real-time embedded systems","redundant hardware","distributed system","BOSS operating system","middleware communications","radar filtering","application threads"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time systems","Fault tolerance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4577690","abstract":"Critical real-time embedded systems need to make use of fault tolerance techniques to cope with operation time errors, either in hardware or software.

Several methodologies have been proposed in recent years for detection of failures in induction motors; however, these methodologies perform the analysis offline. The contribution of this work is the development of an online monitoring of induction motor failures by measuring the vibration transient signals at the start-up with discrete wavelet transform, and its implementation as an embedded system with FPGA for SOC approach.

Induction motors represent 85% of the total power consumption in the world and several faults related to these motors that increase the power consumption are not easily detected; therefore, periodic fault monitoring is mandatory. There are several techniques for fault detection in induction motors being current analysis the most popular among others. This techniques are focused on the analysis of induction motors that are directly fed by the line and do not consider the induced effects due to speed drives. The novelty of this research is the proposal of a new technique, based on discrete wavelet transform for transient analysis at the motor start, for broken rotor bar detection on induction motors fed in both: directly and with speed drive. The contribution of the present work is the development of a field programmable gate array embedded system implementation of a broken rotor bar on-line monitoring system for a low cost embedded system approach. Results from experimentation show the overall system performance.

This service turns out to be essential in applications like Space-based FPGA systems or Set-top Boxes. However, the remote characteristic allows for a set of attacks that may challenge the confidentiality and the integrity of the FPGA configuration, the bitstream. Existing schemes propose to encrypt and to authenticate the bitstream to thwart those attacks. However we show in this paper that they do not prevent the replay of old bitstream versions, and thus give the opportunity to an adversary to downgrade the system. We propose a new technique that ensures bitstream confidentiality and integrity and detects replay of old bitstreams.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure update Mechanism for Remote Update of FPGA-Based System","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems","doi":"10.1109/SIES.2008.4577703","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569831/4577669/04577703.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2008.4577703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4577669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4577703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4577703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Secure update Mechanism for Remote Update of FPGA-Based System","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4577703/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10117498","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure update Mechanism for Remote Update of FPGA-Based System","confLoc":"Le Grande Motte, France","sourcePdf":"30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059827S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569831","isNumber":"4577669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4577669","articleId":"4577703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4577705,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

To overcome these limitations, a new type of Web applications called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) has recently appeared providing richer and more efficient graphical components similar to desktop applications. However, RIAs are rather complex and their development requires the designing and implementation tasks which are time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, RIA development is a new challenge for the Web engineering methodologies requiring their modification and the introduction of other concerns. In this context, we propose a new approach called OOH4RIA which proposes a model-driven development process that extends OOH methodology. It introduces new structural and behavioural models in order to represent a complete RIA and to apply transformations that reduce the effort and accelerate its development. This RIA will be implemented on the promising Google Web Toolkit (GWT) framework.","doi":"10.1109/ICWE.2008.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWE.2008.36","startPage":"13","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Web Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577854/4577855/04577865.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Web Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4577855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Driven Development for GWT-Based Rich Internet Applications with OOH4RIA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Development for GWT-Based Rich Internet Applications with OOH4RIA","conferenceDate":"14-18 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4577865/","accessionNumber":"10114703","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4577865/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Development for GWT-Based Rich Internet Applications with OOH4RIA","confLoc":"Yorktown Heights, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"3261a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096768S","chronDate":"14-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577854","isNumber":"4577855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577854","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4577855","articleId":"4577865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":4577959,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Riveiro","affiliation":["School of Humanities and Informatics, University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Riveiro","id":"37546992500"},{"name":"Goran Falkman","affiliation":["School of Humanities and Informatics, University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden"],"firstName":"Goran","lastName":"Falkman","id":"37546995300"},{"name":"Tom Ziemke","affiliation":["School of Humanities and Informatics, University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Ziemke","id":"37347749200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3268-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0138"}],"articleNumber":"4577959","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data visualisation","engineering computing","interactive systems","marine engineering","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous maritime traffic behavior detection","multidimensional data","large sea area","situation awareness","visual analytics process model","interactive visualization","interactive data mining module","surveillance","vessel behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","interaction","visualization","visual analytics","situation awareness","surveillance"]}],"abstract":"The surveillance of large sea areas often generates huge amounts of multidimensional data.

Conventional clustering algorithms, such as the $k$-means algorithms, the fuzzy $c$-means algorithms, the Gutstafson-Kessel algorithm, etc., all require that each observation contains the same number of features. These algorithms can not be directly applied to asynchronously sampled observations, of which the feature vectors have different number of elements. The traditional approach to this problem is to first interpolate the asynchronously sampled observations into synchronous observations, and then cluster the observations with the above mentioned algorithms. But this approach gives poor result. In this paper, we introduced the concepts of the fuzzy neighborhood and the fuzzy distance norms of asynchronously sampled observations. And using the ideas, we revised the standard FCM algorithm to allow it directly cluster asynchronously sampled data. We call the new algorithm the F2CM algorithm because it is a fuzzy $c$-means clustering algorithm based on fuzzy distance norms between asynchronous observations. Through some examples, it was shown that the F2CM algorithm gave much superior result than the traditional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2008.7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2008.7","startPage":"361","endPage":"368","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578197/4578198/04578254.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Based on Fuzzy Distance Norms for Asynchronously Sampled Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Based on Fuzzy Distance Norms for Asynchronously Sampled Data","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578254/","accessionNumber":"10114780","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578254/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Based on Fuzzy Distance Norms for Asynchronously Sampled Data","confLoc":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"3193a361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052085S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578197","isNumber":"4578198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578197","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4578198","articleId":"4578254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4578349,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Wada","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Wada","id":"37686689200"},{"name":"Paskorn Champrasert","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Paskorn","lastName":"Champrasert","id":"37299658600"},{"name":"Junichi Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37290996900"},{"name":"Katsuya Oba","firstName":"Katsuya","lastName":"Oba","id":"37838817600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3286-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"4578349","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":435},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","quality of service","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","service oriented architecture","quality of service","service level agreement","NP-hard problems","QoS-aware service composition problem","multiobjective genetic algorithm","Pareto solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service Oriented Architecture","QoS","Service Composition","Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SERVICES-1.2008.77","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES-1.2008.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578273","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Congress on Services - Part I","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Congress on Services - Part I","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578272/4578273/04578349.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of SLA-Aware Service Composition","abstract":"In service oriented architecture, each application is often designed as a set of abstract services, which defines its functions.

It is intended to provide a simple, low cost, scalable solution capable of delivering broadband access to end users, by passively sharing a single optical fiber transmission system between several packets. While downstream traffic is broadcast to all packets, the access of upstream traffic to the fiber has to be arbitrated in order to avoid collisions. This arbitration mechanism and more generally, bandwidth distribution and QoS Provisioning, have been left to the implementer. Interleaved Polling with Adaptive Cycle Time (IPACT) is one of the earliest proposed schemes for bandwidth distribution in Ethernet PON (EPON) and has been extensively used as a benchmark by many subsequent allocation schemes. In this paper, we propose an analytical model which yields approximate values for mean queue length and mean packet delay in an EPON with the Gated IPACT scheme under the assumption of Poisson arrivals. We show by simulation that the model is remarkably accurate over the whole load range. We use the model to demonstrate that all ONUs experiment performance degradation in case of local overload by some ONUs, thus showing the necessity of correcting somehow the Gated policy in order to avoid this phenomenon.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mean value analysis approach for evaluating the performance of EPON with Gated IPACT","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Optical Network Design and Modeling","doi":"10.1109/ONDM.2008.4578407","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Optical Network Design and Modeling","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563630/4578384/04578407.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ONDM.2008.4578407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A mean value analysis approach for evaluating the performance of EPON with Gated IPACT","conferenceDate":"12-14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578407/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10114273","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mean value analysis approach for evaluating the performance of EPON with Gated IPACT","confLoc":"Vilanova i la Geltru, Spain","sourcePdf":"NGO.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080561S","chronDate":"12-14 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563630","isNumber":"4578384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563630","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4578384","articleId":"4578407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIPIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4578480,"authors":[{"name":"Cui Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, USA"],"firstName":"Cui","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404178200"},{"name":"Shiyong Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, USA"],"firstName":"Shiyong","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280072400"},{"name":"Zhaoqiang Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhaoqiang","lastName":"Lai","id":"37868989800"},{"name":"Artem Chebotko","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, USA"],"firstName":"Artem","lastName":"Chebotko","id":"37267154300"},{"name":"Xubo Fei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xubo","lastName":"Fei","id":"37543990200"},{"name":"Jing Hua","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Hua","id":"37285799200"},{"name":"Farshad Fotouhi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, USA"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Fotouhi","id":"37267153900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3283-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578480","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":372},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","natural sciences computing","software architecture","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service-oriented architecture","VIEW","visual scientific workflow management system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scientific Workflows","SOA","Reference Architecture","VIEW"]}],"abstract":"Scientific workflows have recently emerged as a new paradigm for scientists to formalize and structure complex and distributed scientific processes to enable and accelerate many scientific discoveries.

The main contributions of this paper are: (i) based on a comprehensive survey of the literature and identification of key requirements for SWFMSs, we propose the first reference architecture for SWFMSs, (ii) in compliance with the reference architecture, we further propose a service-oriented architecture for VIEW (a VIsual sciEntificWorkflow management system), (iii) we implement VIEW to validate the feasibility of the proposed architectures, and (iv) we present two case studies to showcase the applications of our VIEW system.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2008.118","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578428/4578429/04578480.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2008.118","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","startPage":"335","endPage":"342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service-Oriented Architecture for VIEW: A Visual Scientific Workflow Management System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Service-Oriented Architecture for VIEW: A Visual Scientific Workflow Management System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578480/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4578480/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10114830","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service-Oriented Architecture for VIEW: A Visual Scientific Workflow Management System","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"3283a335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073958S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578428","isNumber":"4578429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578428","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4578429","articleId":"4578480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4578609,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbin Liang","affiliation":["Dept. of Eletrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"lastName":"Yingbin Liang","id":"37275171000"},{"name":"Gerhard Kramer","affiliation":["Math. of Networks and Commun.

Specifically, the capacity is derived under the notion of reliable communication based on the average of the error probability over all channel estimation errors. Although not necessarily optimality in presence of channel estimation errors, we restrict the channel inputs to be Gaussians, allowing a closed-form expression for the mutual information, which leads to an inner bound of the capacity region. For different types of transmitter information (e.g. instantaneous and covariance information), we study optimal transmission schemes that permit to maximize the sum-rate. Numerical results show that the performance of covariance feedback is quite sensitive to channel accuracy while the gap between the open-loop and the closed-loop scenario increases with the channel uncertainty. Simulations also assess the performance degradation of transmit/receive correlation and reveal that their impact behaves independently of the estimation errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity bounds for MIMO multiple access channel with imperfect channel state information","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578614","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578614.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578614","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity bounds for MIMO multiple access channel with imperfect channel state information","conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578614/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10114188","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity bounds for MIMO multiple access channel with imperfect channel state information","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048551S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563626","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4578607","articleId":"4578614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4578618,"authors":[{"name":"Viveck Cadambe","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA"],"firstName":"Viveck","lastName":"Cadambe","id":"37540467200"},{"name":"Syed A.

We study these networks in the discrete, memoryless setup, and focus on relaying strategies based on forwarding the interference. In particular, the relay encodes the interference signal so as to make it easier for the receiver to remove it. The objective is to help receivers with weak interference by making the interference strong enough so that these receivers are able to cancel it completely. Our proposed approach is a combination of ideas from decode-and-forward (DF) and/or estimate-and-forward (EF) but applied to the interfering signal rather than the desired signal. When based only on DF, the relay first decodes (part of) the interfering signal it wants to enhance. It then encodes the interference in such a way as to increase the interference at the assisted receiver. The rate of the relayed interference is not limited by the rate from the relay to the original destination of the forwarded message, thus, interference cancellation is not a by-product of enhancing the desired information at its intended destination, but a goal in itself. We call this method interference-forwarding (IF). IF can also be based on EF where, instead of forwarding the exact interfering signal, the relay simply sends a compressed version of it to the assisted receiver. Rate increase can thus be obtained even if the signal received at the relay is independent of the desired message and consists only of interference and noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4578619/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10114193","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Relay strategies for interference-forwarding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay strategies for interference-forwarding","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068831S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563626","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4578607","articleId":"4578619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4578622,"authors":[{"name":"Jouko Leinonen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jouko","lastName":"Leinonen","id":"37391298600"},{"name":"Jyri Hamalainen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyri","lastName":"Hamalainen","id":"37269110200"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2269-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2270-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2271-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578622","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Resource management","Feedback","Quantization","Round robin","Performance analysis","Wireless communication","Frequency conversion","Signal to noise ratio","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","feedback","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage capacity analysis","downlink ODFMA resource allocation","downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access","feedback channel","best-M feedback method"]}],"abstract":"Theoretical outage capacity analysis for resource allocation in a downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) with limited feedback is presented.

In numerical experiments, we could compute the minimum size of stopping sets of LDPC codes of length about 500, 1000 and 5000 with high reliability, and could find smaller stopping sets than that found by conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578623","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578623.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic algorithm for finding the minimum-size stopping sets of LDPC codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic algorithm for finding the minimum-size stopping sets of LDPC codes","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578623/","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10114197","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic algorithm for finding the minimum-size stopping sets of LDPC codes","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070138S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563626","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4578607","articleId":"4578623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4578624,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Bo Zhou","id":"37289066500"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Li Zhang","id":"37292616500"},{"name":"Qin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Qin Huang","id":"37405852800"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Shu Lin","id":"37067204800"},{"name":"Meina Xu","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Space Technology, Inc., Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Meina Xu","id":"37688361200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2269-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2270-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2271-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578624","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative algorithms","Iterative decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","AWGN channels","Fast Fourier transforms","Sum product algorithm","Belief propagation","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","fast Fourier transforms","parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary quasicyclic LDPC codes","AWGN channel","iterative decoding","fast Fourier transform","sum-product algorithm","Reed-Solomon codes","hard-decision Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","algebraic soft-decision Kotter-Vardy algorithm","adaptive belief propagation algorithm","linear complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578624","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578624.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578624","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructions of high performance non-binary quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","abstract":"This paper presents algebraic methods for constructing high performance quasi-cyclic LDPC codes over non-binary fields. Experimental results show that codes constructed based on these methods perform well over the AWGN channel with iterative decoding using a fast Fourier transform based sum-product algorithm. They achieve significantly large coding gains over Reed-Solomon codes of the same lengths and rates decoded with the hard-decision Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, the algebraic soft-decision Kotter-Vardy algorithm, and the Jiang-Narayananpsilas adaptive belief propagation algorithm. Due to their quasi-cyclic structure, these LDPC codes can be efficiently encoded using simple shift-registers with linear complexity.

This family was recently rediscovered by Paredes et al., and they pointed out that such STBCs enable reduced-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. Independently, the same STBCs were found in the work of Samuel and Fitz (2007) and named multi-strata space-time codes. In this paper we show how this code can be constructed algebraically from a particular cyclic division algebra (CDA). This formulation enables to prove that the code has the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) property and hence achieves the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) optimality. The fact that the normalized minimum determinant is 1/radic(7) places this code in the second position with respect to the golden code, which exhibits a minimum determinant of 1/radic(5), and motivates the name silver code.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578628","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578628.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the algebraic structure of the Silver code: A 2 \u00d7 2 perfect space-time block code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578628","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578628/","displayDocTitle":"On the algebraic structure of the Silver code: A 2 \u00d7 2 perfect space-time block code","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10114202","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578628/","conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the algebraic structure of the Silver code: A 2 \u00d7 2 perfect space-time block code","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061294S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563626","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4578607","articleId":"4578628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4578635,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Dai","id":"37555483600"},{"name":"Olgica Milenkovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Olgica","lastName":"Milenkovic","id":"37269359700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2269-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2270-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2271-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578635","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"We introduce a new family of codes, termed weighted Euclidean superimposed codes (WESCs).

In the framework of cooperative wireless networks, some specific terminals can be equipped with cognition capabilities, i.e, the relay in our model. In the discrete memoryless (DM) case, we derive lower and upper bounds on channel capacity. The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme at the relay that consists in a combination of codeword splitting, Gelpsilafand-Pinsker binning, and a decode-and-forward scheme. The upper bound is better than that obtained by assuming the availability of state at the source, the relay, and the destination. For the Gaussian case, we also derive lower and upper bounds on channel capacity. The lower bound, obtained by a coding scheme based on combination of codeword splitting and generalized dirty paper coding, is tight in some cases if the channel is physically degraded. The upper bound is also better than that obtained by assuming that the channel state is available at the source, the relay, and the destination.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578638","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578638.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578638","startPage":"139","endPage":"143","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578638","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative relaying with state available at the relay","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4578638/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10114214","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative relaying with state available at the relay","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060248S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563626","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4578607","articleId":"4578638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4578646,"authors":[{"name":"Jayanth Nayak","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jayanth","lastName":"Nayak","id":"37283049500"},{"name":"Ertem Tuncel","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ertem","lastName":"Tuncel","id":"37283379900"},{"name":"Deniz Gunduz","affiliation":["Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"Gunduz","id":"37284016000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2269-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2270-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2271-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578646","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"This paper deals with the design of coding schemes for lossy transmission of a source over a broadcast channel when there is correlated side information at the receivers.

Assuming correlated fading in each hop, each relay receives a faded version of the signal transmitted by the previous level, performs precoding on the received signal and retransmits it to the next level. Using free probability theory and assuming that the noise power at the relay levels - but not at the receiver - is negligible, a closed-form expression of the end-to-end asymptotic instantaneous mutual information is derived as the number of antennas in all levels grow large with the same rate. This asymptotic expression is shown to be independent from the channel realizations, to only depend on the channel statistics and to also serve as the asymptotic value of the end-to-end average mutual information. We also provide the optimal singular vectors of the precoding matrices that maximize the asymptotic mutual information : the optimal transmit directions represented by the singular vectors of the precoding matrices are aligned on the eigenvectors of the channel correlation matrices, therefore they can be determined only using the known statistics of the channel matrices and do not depend on a particular channel realization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic capacity and optimal precoding strategy of multi-level precode & forward in correlated channels","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578651","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578651.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578651","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic capacity and optimal precoding strategy of multi-level precode & forward in correlated channels","conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578651/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10114226","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic capacity and optimal precoding strategy of multi-level precode & forward in correlated channels","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044473S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4578651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4578652,"authors":[{"name":"Carolin Huppert","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Applied Information Theory, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Carolin","lastName":"Huppert","id":"37321401700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2269-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2270-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2271-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578652","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Transmitters","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Power system modeling","Base stations","Information theory","Degradation","Interference channels","Propagation losses","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast systems","Tomlinson-Harashima-precoding","dirty-paper-coding","transmit power"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578652","abstract":"Tomlinson-Harashima-precoding can be used as dirty-paper-coding method for transmissions over a broadcast channel.

The receiver here is an adaptation of previous work presented in A.F. Santos, et al, (2008), where a BPSK signal is encoded by a binary code and blindly recovered in a turbo way. The main concept is to exploit the constraints imposed by the parity check equations of the code at the transmitted sequence for estimating the channel. Here multilevel codes are used for imposing the necessary constraints on a PAM signal for blind channel estimation. The performance of the proposed system is encouraging. It shows that our blind channel estimator gets close to the same BER of the turbo equalizer with perfect channel knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","startPage":"353","endPage":"357","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578684.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind turbo multipath channel estimation of PAM signals exploiting multilevel codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multipath channels","Pulse modulation","Amplitude modulation","Statistics","Binary phase shift keying","Binary codes","Parity check codes","Equations","Blind equalizers","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","blind equalisers","channel estimation","multipath channels","pulse amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind turbo multipath channel estimation","PAM signals","multilevel codes","pulse amplitude modulation signals","BPSK signal","binary code","parity check equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind turbo multipath channel estimation of PAM signals exploiting multilevel codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578684/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578684/","accessionNumber":"10105124","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind turbo multipath channel estimation of PAM signals exploiting multilevel codes","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065031S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563626","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4578607","articleId":"4578684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4578693,"authors":[{"name":"Clarice Dias de Albuquerque","affiliation":["Departamento de Telem\u00e1tica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Clarice Dias","lastName":"de Albuquerque","id":"38252827800"},{"name":"Reginaldo Palazzo","affiliation":["Departamento de Telem\u00e1tica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Reginaldo","lastName":"Palazzo","id":"37284227200"},{"name":"Eduardo Brandani da Silva","affiliation":["Departamento de Matem\u00e1tica, Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eduardo Brandani","lastName":"da Silva","id":"38255370800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2269-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2270-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2271-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578693","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578693","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Tensile stress","Hilbert space","Quantum computing","Constellation diagram","Digital modulation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Parity check codes","Degradation","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topological quantum codes","compact surfaces","topological quantum error-correcting codes","toric code construction process"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we construct a class of topological quantum error-correcting codes on compact surfaces with genus g ges 2.

However, when reliable communication at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) is desired, both techniques are impractical: the Viterbi algorithm requires large amounts of memory and numbers of computations to decode powerful codes, while sequential decoding at low SNR requires exploring large portions of the code tree. In this paper we present a novel two-pass decoder which incorporates features of both these techniques but can achieve decoding complexities lower than either of them. The decoder initially performs a backward pass that resembles the add-compare-select stage of the Viterbi decoder or the backward stage of the BCJR decoder. However, it is performed not on the trellis representing the actual code used for transmission, but on a higher rate supercode (a linear code containing all codewords of the original code) with a simpler trellis representation. The supercode state metrics obtained in the backward pass are preserved and subsequently used in the forward pass. The forward pass involves the actual tree search for the most likely transmitted codeword (of the original code), and the supercode state metrics serve as heuristics, speeding up the search process. We demonstrate that such a decoder, with a proper choice of parameters, can be made equivalent to a sequential decoder with the Fano metric, a sequential decoder with an ML metric, or a Viterbi decoder (run backwards). However, the decoder operates most effectively in between these modes, when the computational load is distributed evenly between the backward and forward stages.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563626/4578607/04578697.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2008.4578697","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2008.4578697","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578697","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Viterbi algorithm","Convolutional codes","Linear code","Distributed computing","Costs","Code standards","Signal to noise ratio","Computer science","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential decoding","tree searching","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supercode heuristics","tree search decoding","two-pass decoder","decoding complexity","Viterbi decoder","BCJR decoder","trellis representation","supercode state metrics","codeword","sequential decoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578697/","displayDocTitle":"Supercode heuristics for tree search decoding","accessionNumber":"10105137","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4578697/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 May 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supercode heuristics for tree search decoding","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04785S","chronDate":"5-9 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4563626","isNumber":"4578607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563626","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4578607","articleId":"4578697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4578698,"authors":[{"name":"Shrinivas Kudekar","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Science, EPFL, I&C, LTHC, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Shrinivas","lastName":"Kudekar","id":"37546699200"},{"name":"Nicolas Macris","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Science, EPFL, I&C, LTHC, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Macris","id":"37563656600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2269-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2270-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2271-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578698","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"We consider communication over a binary input memoryless output symmetric channel with low density generator matrix codes and optimal maximum a posteriori decoding.

We show that the optimal input covariance satisfies a simple fixed-point equation involving key system quantities, including the MMSE matrix. We also specialize the form of the optimal input covariance to the asymptotic regimes of low and high snr. We demonstrate that in the low-snr regime the optimal covariance fully correlates the inputs to better combat noise. In contrast, in the high-snr regime the optimal covariance is diagonal with diagonal elements obeying the generalized mercury/waterfilling power allocation policy.

By using low-loss waveguide combining and a packaged monolithic microwave integrated circuit with a low-loss microstrip-to-waveguide launcher, the output loss is minimized, allowing for the overall power-combining efficiency to remain high, 80% (average insertion loss of combiner < 0.7 dB and average insertion loss of launcher <0.3 dB) over 31-36 GHz. In the past, lower power-combining efficiencies have limited the number of modules that can be combined at -band, and hence, have limited the power output. The approach demonstrated in this paper, with high power-combining efficiency, allows a very large number (32) of solid-state amplifier modules to be combined to produce high powers. Greater than 50 W was demonstrated with low power modules, but even higher powers 120 W are possible. The current approach is based on corporate combining, using low-loss waveguide septum combiners that provide isolation, maintaining the true graceful degradation of a modular solid-state amplifier system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Solid state circuits","Insertion loss","Integrated circuit packaging","Microwave integrated circuits","MMICs","Monolithic integrated circuits","Microstrip","Multichip modules","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","modules","power combiners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ka-band amplifier","solid-state amplifier","waveguide combining","waveguide septum combiners","monolithic microwave integrated circuit","microstrip-to-waveguide launcher","low power modules","frequency 31 GHz to 36 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifiers","dielectric-loaded waveguides","high-power $Ka$-band","power combiners","solid state"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.927299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4589151/04578712.pdf","startPage":"1899","endPage":"1908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.927299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Power --Band (31\u201336 GHz) Solid-State Amplifier Based on Low-Loss Corporate Waveguide Combining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High-Power <formula><tex>$Ka$</tex></formula>-Band (31\u201336 GHz) Solid-State Amplifier Based on Low-Loss Corporate Waveguide Combining","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578712/","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578712/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10144029","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Power <formula><tex>$Ka$</tex></formula>-Band (31\u201336 GHz) Solid-State Amplifier Based on Low-Loss Corporate Waveguide Combining","sourcePdf":"56tmtt08-epp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069835S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4589151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4589151","articleId":"4578712","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":4578714,"authors":[{"name":"Emad Hamidi","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4589151/4578714/4578714-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emad Hamidi was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1978.

The SIW serves as a bandpass data transmission channel providing 15-GHz bandwidth. The hybrid structure utilizes the available low-pass frequency region below the cutoff frequency by adding striplines inside the waveguide. This technique of substrate reuse allows several independent data channels to be transmitted simultaneously through the hybrid structure. Hence, the channel capacity is increased without changing the overall waveguide footprint. Transition structures for routing striplines in the waveguide are designed and optimized through full-wave simulations. A number of test structures are fabricated to investigate data transmission using single and hybrid SIW interconnects. Experiments, as well as system simulations, demonstrate the capability of these interconnects for achieving ultra-high-speed data transmission. The hybrid waveguide system yields 15-Gb/s aggregate data transmission with excellent signal integrity characteristics. The proposed hybrid structure suggests an alternative solution for implementation of parallel data transmission systems with significant increase in the total channel throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.927409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4589151/04578716.pdf","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.927409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-High-Speed Multichannel Data Transmission Using Hybrid Substrate Integrated Waveguides","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578716/","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-High-Speed Multichannel Data Transmission Using Hybrid Substrate Integrated Waveguides","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144041","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578716/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-High-Speed Multichannel Data Transmission Using Hybrid Substrate Integrated Waveguides","sourcePdf":"56tmtt08-suntives.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058623S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4589151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4589151","articleId":"4578716","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4578740,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Nontechnical losses represent a significant proportion of electricity losses in both developing and developed countries. The ELM-based approach presented here uses customer load-profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. This approach provides a method of data mining for this purpose, and it involves extracting patterns of customer behavior from historical kWh consumption data. The results yield classification classes that are used to reveal whether any significant behavior that emerges is due to irregularities in consumption. In this paper, ELM and online sequential-ELM (OS-ELM) algorithms are both used to achieve an improved classification performance and to increase accuracy of results. A comparison of this approach with other classification techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, is also undertaken and the ELM performance and accuracy in NTL analysis is shown to be superior.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4578730/04578740.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.926431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.926431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Utility Nontechnical Loss Analysis With Extreme Learning Machine Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Data mining","Machine learning algorithms","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","State estimation","Australia","Consumer electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","power system analysis computing","power utilisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power utility nontechnical loss analysis","extreme learning machine method","electricity losses","customer load-profile information","data mining","customer behavior pattern","classification performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification techniques","extreme machine learning (ELM)","nontechnical losses (NTL)","support vector machine (SVM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power Utility Nontechnical Loss Analysis With Extreme Learning Machine Method","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4578740/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10117920","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Utility Nontechnical Loss Analysis With Extreme Learning Machine Method","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs03-nizar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080244S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4578730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"4578730","articleId":"4578740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4578743,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yang Zhang (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree from North China Electric Power University, Baoging, China, in 1997 and the M.Eng. degree from China Electric Power Research Institute (CEPRI), Beijing, China, in 2001.

In this paper, we show that linear regulation can in fact reduce the effective supply impedance of digital circuits without increasing their total power dissipation. Achieving this goal requires minimizing the static power dissipation of the regulator, leading to a push-pull topology (similar to the regulators demonstrated by Wu and Sanders, 2001, Poon et al, 1999, and Intersil, 1998) with comparator-based feedback and a switched source-follower output stage. Measured results from a regulator implemented in a 65 nm SOI test-chip verify that by using these techniques, regulation reduces the effective supply noise by ~30% while also enabling a slight decrease (1.4%) in total power dissipation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4578744/04578745.pdf","startPage":"1795","endPage":"1807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.925403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.925403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Regulation for Energy-Efficient Digital Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Digital circuits","Regulators","Power dissipation","Impedance","Circuit topology","Output feedback","Power measurement","Noise measurement","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital integrated circuits","power supply circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated regulation","energy-efficient digital circuits","effective supply impedance","static power dissipation","push-pull topology","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital integrated circuits","power supply distribution","regulators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Regulation for Energy-Efficient Digital Circuits","volume":"43","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4578745/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10183465","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Regulation for Energy-Efficient Digital Circuits","sourcePdf":"43jssc08-alon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092991S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4578744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4578744","articleId":"4578745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4578747,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Brama","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi dell'Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Modena e Reggio Emila, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4578744/4578747/4578747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Riccardo Brama (S'00\u2013A'01) graduated summa cum laude in 2004 from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy, with a thesis on the Class-E Power Amplifier for DCS 1800.","In 2005, he was a STMicroelectronics \u201cStudio di Microelettronica\u201d (PV) consultant for the design of Power Amplifiers during the FIRB project \u201cEnabling technologies for wireless reconfigurable terminals.\u201d He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree working on power amplifiers and integrated circuits design at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia."]},"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Brama","id":"37589785800"},{"name":"Luca Larcher","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi dell'Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Modena e Reggio Emila, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4578744/4578747/4578747-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Larcher (M'01) graduated in electronic engineering from the University of Padova, Italy, in 1998.

Issues preventing PA integration include LO pulling phenomena, thermal dissipation, and power efficiency. In this work we investigate high efficiency watt range Class-E PAs and integrated baluns. In particular, insights in the design of a fully differential cascode topology for high efficiency and reliable operation are provided and a narrowband lumped element balun, employing minimum number of integrated inductors for minimum power loss, is introduced. Two versions have been manufactured using a 0.13 mum CMOS technology. The first comprises the driver, and a differential PA connected to an external low-loss commercial balun. Experiments prove 31 dBm delivered output power, with 58% PAE and 67% drain efficiency, at 1.7 GHz. The second version adopts the same driver and PA and also integrates the balun.

First, a highly-parallel decoder architecture with low routing overhead is described. Second, we propose an efficient method to detect early convergence of the iterative decoder and terminate the computations, thereby reducing dynamic power. We report on a bit-serial fully-parallel LDPC decoder fabricated in a 0.13-mum CMOS process and show how the above techniques affect the power consumption. With early termination, the prototype is capable of decoding with 10.4 pJ/bit/iteration, while performing within 3 dB of the Shannon limit at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n and with 3.3 Gb/s total throughput. If operated from a 0.6 V supply, the energy consumption can be further reduced to 2.7 pJ/bit/iteration while maintaining a total throughput of 648 Mb/s, due to the highly-parallel architecture. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed architecture for longer codes, we also report on a bit-serial fully-parallel decoder for the (2048, 1723) LDPC code in 10 GBase-T standard synthesized with a 90-nm CMOS library.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","volume":"43","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10181429","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4578752/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Reduction Techniques for LDPC Decoders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Reduction Techniques for LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"43jssc08-darabiha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114078S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4578744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4578744","articleId":"4578752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4578755,"authors":[{"name":"Sander L.

The other ldquoclockrdquo pulse tracks the phase of the incoming data by a process of pulse removal and reinsertion. Because both pulses share the same ring, there is no frequency mismatch between the incoming data stream and the recovered clock in frequency synchronous systems, allowing for large data run lengths.

The noise and input-impedance matched LNA employs a cascode input stage with shunt-series, transformer feedback. A theoretical and experimental comparison with a conventional inductor-feedback LNA indicates 0.5-1 dB higher gain, 0.3-0.6 dB lower noise figure and better input return loss for the transformer feedback LNA. The receiver has a differential down-conversion gain of 13 dB, an input P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1dB</sub>\n of -16.2 dBm, and a double-sideband noise figure of 8.5 to 10 dB at an IF of 1 GHz. Because of the transformer feedback, the input return loss is better than -20 dB from 80 to 92 GHz and remains below -10 dB from 70 GHz beyond 95 GHz. The circuit occupies an area of 460 mum times 500 mum and consumes 89 mW (47 mW in the LNA and mixer) from a 1.5 V supply. An LO-to-RF isolation of 60 dB was measured for LO signals in the 80-to-85 GHz range. Measurements of the mixer breakout, which includes transformers at the RF and LO ports, show a record NF\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DSB</sub>\n of 8 to 10 dB over the 74-to-91 GHz band. The 50-Omega noise figure of the LNA is 6.4 to 8.4 dB in the 75-to-88.5 GHz range. The LNA can also be employed as a transmitter output stage with a saturated output power of +4 dBm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578757/","volume":"43","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4578757/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10181426","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband W-Band Receiver Front-End in 65-nm CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband W-Band Receiver Front-End in 65-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"43jssc08-khanpour.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138769S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4578744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4578744","articleId":"4578757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4578758,"authors":[{"name":"Peter M.

Integration of the sensor interface electrodes and active electrochemical detection circuitry on a CMOS substrate miniaturizes the sensing platform, enhancing its portability for use in point-of-care applications, while enabling the high-throughput, highly parallel analysis characteristic of traditional microarrays.

Integrated potentiostats, comprised of control amplifiers and dual-slope analog-to-digital converters, stimulate the electrochemical cell and detect the current flowing through the on-chip gold electrodes at each sensor site that results from biomolecular reactions occurring on the chip surface. Post-processing steps needed to fabricate a biologically-compatible surface-electrode array in CMOS that can withstand operation in a harsh electrochemical environment are also described.

The direct-conversion transceiver is designed to be very flexible in respect of biasing and programmability, both to allow power consumption to be traded adaptively versus performance, and flexibility for any changes in the new transmission standard. Signal loopback and transmit power detection techniques are used in conjunction with the baseband modem processor to calibrate transmitter LO leakage and the transceiver and receiver IQ imbalances.

The memory cell is based on a 1-transistor 1-magnetic tunnel junction (1T1MTJ) bit cell with a toggle MTJ. For reads, the memory is architected with word lines connecting a row of bits to bit lines with a pass transistor and two stages of columns selection transistors connecting bit lines to dual sense amplifiers. For writes, a read is first performed to determine the state of bits to be written followed by a toggle decision to enable bit line toggle drivers. Overlapping bit and word line currents toggle the selected bits. The new dual sense amplifier architecture separates the amplifier reference bits from the bias bits thereby improving sensitivity and reducing offset. The write driver uses a switched capacitor and charge sharing to improve ground bounce immunity and reduce area. Embedded test registers control internal memory timing, reference voltages, reference currents and access features enabling detailed characterization of the memory and optimization of the design. An example describing optimization of the write parameters is presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Driver circuits","Magnetoresistance","Random access memory","CMOS process","Magnetic tunneling","Capacitors","Testing","Registers","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","magnetic storage","magnetoresistive devices","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRAM","memory module","magnetoresistive random access memory","CMOS","1-transistor 1-magnetic tunnel junction","pass transistor","dual sense amplifier","switched capacitor","storage capacity 180 Kbit","size 0.28 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic memories","magnetoresistance","memory architecture","MRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578760","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.925408","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4578744/04578760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.925408","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 180 Kbit Embeddable MRAM Memory Module","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 180 Kbit Embeddable MRAM Memory Module","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578760/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","volume":"43","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4578760/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10183466","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 180 Kbit Embeddable MRAM Memory Module","sourcePdf":"43jssc08-nahas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054579S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4578744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4578744","articleId":"4578760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4578765,"authors":[{"name":"Kentaro Yamamoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4578744/4578765/4578765-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kentaro Yamamoto (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2004, and the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2006.

The current-fed full-bridge boost converter can achieve ZCS by utilizing the leakage inductance and parasitic capacitance as the resonant tank. In order to achieve ZCS under a wide load range and with various input voltages, the turn-on time of the boost converter is kept constant, and the output voltage is regulated via frequency modulation. The steady-state analysis and the ZCS operation conditions under various load and input-voltage conditions are discussed. Finally, a laboratory prototype converter with a 22-27-V input voltage and 1-kV/1-kW output is implemented to verify the performance. The experimental results show that the converter can achieve high output voltage gains, and the highest efficiency of the converter is 92% at full-load condition with an input voltage of 27 V.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.926056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.926056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578767","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1226","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4578767/04578775.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578775","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching converters","Zero current switching","Voltage","DC-DC power converters","Inductance","Parasitic capacitance","Resonance","Frequency modulation","Steady-state","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","frequency modulation","resonant power convertors","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-fed full-bridge boost DC-DC converter","zero-current switching","high-voltage applications","constant on-time control","leakage inductance","parasitic capacitance","resonant tank","frequency modulation","steady-state analysis","full-load condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current fed","high voltage","zero-current switching (ZCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study and Implementation of a Current-Fed Full-Bridge Boost DC\u2013DC Converter With Zero-Current Switching for High-Voltage Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10130735","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4578775/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578775/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study and Implementation of a Current-Fed Full-Bridge Boost DC\u2013DC Converter With Zero-Current Switching for High-Voltage Applications","sourcePdf":"44tia04-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067384S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4578767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4578767","articleId":"4578775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4578777,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Tai Cheng","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Power Technologies, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4578767/4578777/4578777-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Po-Tai Cheng (S'96\u2013M'99) received the B.S. degree from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1990, and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1994 and 1999, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu.

In particular, in the high-tech industry parks of Taiwan, manufacturers can lose up to one million U.S. dollars for each voltage sag event. Some utility companies provide dual power feeders to these high-tech manufacturers to enhance power quality and reliability. The solid-state transfer switch (STS) based on thyristors can thus utilize the dual power feeders to protect sensitive loads against voltage sags. Conventional STS often requires more than a quarter cycle to complete the transfer process because its commutation is load dependent. An improved STS with impulse commutated circuit can greatly reduce the transfer time and provide better ride-through capability against voltage sags. In this paper, an impulse commutation bridge STS (ICBSTS) system is proposed to further simplify the forced-commutation circuitry. This paper also discusses the in-rush phenomenon of the transformer due to the line transfer. A flux estimator is developed with the ICBSTS system to reduce the in-rush current.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an Impulse Commutation Bridge for the Solid-State Transfer Switch","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.926311","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.926311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4578767/04578777.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Impulse Commutation Bridge for the Solid-State Transfer Switch","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4578777/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10173397","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Impulse Commutation Bridge for the Solid-State Transfer Switch","sourcePdf":"44tia04-cheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051247S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4578767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4578767","articleId":"4578777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4578790,"authors":[{"name":"Natchpong Hatti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4578767/4578790/4578790-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Natchpong Hatti (S'07) was born in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand, in 1971.

To deal with unbalanced and nonlinear loads in a high power system, this paper suggests a multilevel four-leg pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage-source inverter (VSI) as a topology for the high power applications where a function is required to control the zero-sequence component as well as dq components. This paper proposes a carrier-based PWM method for a multilevel four-leg PWM VSI along with introducing a novel offset voltage. The proposed offset voltage makes it possible for the switching sequence of all the legs to be optimized for minimizing the harmonic distortion of the output voltage irrespective of the number of inverter levels. The proposed PWM method based on digital signal processors is implemented and tested by using a prototype three-level four-leg VSI. The feasibility of the proposed PWM method is verified by the spectral analysis, simulation, and experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4578767/04578795.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.926201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.926201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Carrier-Based PWM Method With Optimal Switching Sequence for a Multilevel Four-Leg Voltage-Source Inverter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation","Pulse power systems","Power system control","Power systems","Pulse inverters","Topology","Nonlinear control systems","Voltage control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","harmonic distortion","PWM invertors","spectral analysis","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier-based PWM method","optimal switching sequence","multilevel four-leg voltage-source inverter","single-phase nonlinear loads","three-phase unbalanced loads","three-phase four-wire utility system","neutral line current","zero-sequence current","pulsewidth modulation voltage-source inverter","offset voltage","harmonic distortion","digital signal processors","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel four-leg","offset voltage","optimal switching sequence","pulsewidth modulation","three-phase four-wire","voltage-source inverter","zero-sequence current"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Carrier-Based PWM Method With Optimal Switching Sequence for a Multilevel Four-Leg Voltage-Source Inverter","volume":"44","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4578795/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10130746","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Carrier-Based PWM Method With Optimal Switching Sequence for a Multilevel Four-Leg Voltage-Source Inverter","sourcePdf":"44tia04-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072794S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4578767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4578767","articleId":"4578795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4578797,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Linear induction and linear synchronous machines have been presented and experimentally tested in vertical elevators. In this paper, four longitudinal LSRM configurations are presented and designed to operate as propulsion actuators in a vertical elevator prototype. Two of the four configurations have been presented earlier in horizontal propulsion experiments, and a third one has been proposed for application in vertical elevators. All four LSRMs are designed for similar static force profiles to allow for their comparison. The designed LSRM configurations are compared by using finite-element analysis and dynamic control simulations. The stator, translator, and copper winding weight and dimensions, footprint area, active material weight, normal forces and payload capabilities for all four configurations are contrasted. The configuration with the highest payload capability is chosen for implementation in an experimental prototype. The prototype vertical elevator is 1.27 m tall with a 1-ft-tall elevator vehicle with no counterweights and uses two LSRM setups on each side. The experimental correlation of propulsion force and inductance is presented to validate the theoretical design method used in this research.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4578767/04578797.pdf","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.926294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.926294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Linear Switched Reluctance Machines for Vertical Propulsion Application: Analysis, Design, and Experimental Correlation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance machines","Propulsion","Elevators","Prototypes","Payloads","Synchronous machines","Testing","Actuators","Finite element methods","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric actuators","electric propulsion","finite element analysis","lifts","linear synchronous motors","reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear switched reluctance machines","vertical elevators","linear induction machine","linear synchronous machine","propulsion actuators","finite-element analysis","dynamic control simulations","stator","translator","copper winding","payload capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elevators","linear motors","linear switched reluctance machines (LSRMs)","reluctance motors","vertical propulsion system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Linear Switched Reluctance Machines for Vertical Propulsion Application: Analysis, Design, and Experimental Correlation","volume":"44","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4578797/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10130749","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Linear Switched Reluctance Machines for Vertical Propulsion Application: Analysis, Design, and Experimental Correlation","sourcePdf":"44tia04-lobo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053243S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4578767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4578767","articleId":"4578797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4578798,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The theoretical boundary of reverse-biased SOA caused by the false turn-on is obtained by simulations. The short-circuit capability of the 1200-V SiC BJT is also investigated theoretically and experimentally. Self-heating is considered by the nonisothermal simulation, and 1800-K maximum local temperature is the simulated critical temperature of device failure. The surface condition is very critical for short-circuit capability. From simulations, when the interface trap density increases, the critical temperature decreases. This is believed to be the reason why the experimental results show much shorter short-circuit withstand time than the simulation showed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4578833/04578846.pdf","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Analyses of Safe Operating Area (SOA) of 1200-V 4H-SiC BJT","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.926682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.926682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Analyses of Safe Operating Area (SOA) of 1200-V 4H-SiC BJT","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177183","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4578846/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and Experimental Analyses of Safe Operating Area (SOA) of 1200-V 4H-SiC BJT","sourcePdf":"55ted08-gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056176S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4578833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4578833","articleId":"4578846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4578847,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Gurfinkel","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Moshe Gurfinkel (S'07) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (both cum laude) in electrical engineering in 2003 and 2005, respectively, from Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","He has recently participated in an exchange program at the University of Maryland, College Park, and has been a Guest Researcher with the Semiconductor Electronics Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD.

The aim of this paper is to obtain the key device characteristics of SiC MOSFETs so that their realistic application prospect can be provided. In particular, the emphasis is on obtaining their losses in various operation conditions from the extensive characterization study and a proposed behavioral SPICE model. Using the validated MOSFET SPICE model, a 20-kHz 370-W dc/dc boost converter based on a 10-kV 4H-SiC DMOSFET and diodes is designed and experimentally demonstrated. In the steady state of the boost converter, the total power loss in the 15.45-mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n SiC MOSFET is 23.6 W for the input power of 428 W. The characterization study of the experimental SiC MOSFET and the experiment of the SiC MOSFET-based boost converter indicate that the turn-on losses of SiC MOSFETs are the dominant factors in determining their maximum operation frequency in hard-switched circuits with conventional thermal management. Replacing a 10-kV SiC PiN diode with a 10-kV SiC JBS diode as a boost diode and using a small external gate resistor, the turn-on loss of the SiC MOSFET can be reduced, and the 10-kV 5-A SiC MOSFET-based boost converter is predicted to be capable of a 20-kHz operation with a 5-kV dc output voltage and a 1.25-kW output power by the PSpice simulation with the MOSFET model. The low losses and fast switching speed of 10-kV SiC MOSFETs shown in the characterization study and the preliminary demonstration of the boost converter make them attractive in high-frequency high-voltage power-conversion applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization, Modeling, and Application of 10-kV SiC MOSFET","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.926650","startPage":"1798","endPage":"1806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.926650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4578833/04578891.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Characterization, Modeling, and Application of 10-kV SiC MOSFET","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4578891/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177229","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization, Modeling, and Application of 10-kV SiC MOSFET","sourcePdf":"55ted08-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068798S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4578833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"258","xplore-issue":"4578833","articleId":"4578891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4578899,"authors":[{"name":"Huaxiang Yin","affiliation":["Semiconductor Device Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4578833/4578899/4578899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaxiang Yin (M'06) was born in Hunan, China.

A novel current enhancement layer was adopted to reduce the JFET resistance and enhance conductivity modulation by improving hole current spreading and suppressing the electron current conduction through the top n-p-n transistor. Inductive switching results have shown that the p-IGBT exhibited a turn-off time of ~1 mus and a turn-off energy loss of 12 m J at 4-kV dc-link voltage and 6-A load current at 25degC. The turn-off trajectory from the measured inductive load switching waveforms and numerical simulations shows that the p-IGBT had a near-square reverse bias safe operating area. Numerical simulations have been conducted to achieve an improved tradeoff between forward voltage drop and switching off energy by investigating the effects of drift layer lifetime and p-buffer layer parameters. The advantages of SiC p-IGBTs, such as the potential of very low ON-state resistance, slightly positive temperature coefficient, high switching speed, small switching losses, and large safe operating area, make them suitable and attractive for high-power high-frequency applications.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.926627","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4578833/04578902.pdf","startPage":"1912","endPage":"1919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.926627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Characterization of High-Voltage 4H-SiC p-IGBTs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578902/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Characterization of High-Voltage 4H-SiC p-IGBTs","volume":"55","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578902/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10177231","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Characterization of High-Voltage 4H-SiC p-IGBTs","sourcePdf":"55ted08-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070394S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4578833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4578833","articleId":"4578902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4578924,"authors":[{"name":"Ho Pham Huy Anh","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ho Pham Huy Anh","id":"37087072823"},{"name":"Kyoung Kwan Ahn","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyoung Kwan Ahn","id":"37087276960"},{"name":"Yoon Jong Il","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yoon Jong Il","id":"37087276807"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2425-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2426-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578924","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverse problems","Muscles","Robots","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Prototypes","Fuzzy systems","Neural networks","Automotive engineering","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","pneumatic control equipment","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse model identification","pneumatic artificial muscle","robot arm","NARX fuzzy model","genetic algorithm","nonlinear coupling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM)","2-axes PAM robot arm","genetic algorithm","nonlinear Inverse Double NARX Fuzzy model","modeling and identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578924","abstract":"In this paper, a novel Inverse Double NARX fuzzy model is used for modeling and identifying simultaneously both of joints of the prototype 2-axes PAM robot arm\u2019s inverse dynamic model.

Classifying text can involve determining the genre of a book, categorizing a document, or in our case deciding whether an email is spam. The idea behind language classification is to teach the computer to be a filing clerk. Spam filters using a Bayesian combination of the spam probabilities of individual words that employ language classification read and filter your email by learning your personal email behavior (what you think is and isnpsilat spam). There are many spam filters written based on this technology and applied effectively for English and other languages. But they got a low effect when applied directly at Vietnamese spam. Because the token segmentation of the Bayesian filters is not suitable for Vietnamese specific characteristics. We, therefore, propose a Vietnamese segmentation for using token selection for building a Vietnamese spam filter based on language classification and Bayesian combination to sufficiently support Vietnamese. The result is very satisfactory. Thanks to this technique, our filter for Vietnamese spam is 9% more accurate when compared to other filters which use other segmentation technical.","doi":"10.1109/CCE.2008.4578936","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Communications and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Communications and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562709/4578921/04578936.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCE.2008.4578936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vietnamese spam detection based on language classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578936/","displayDocTitle":"Vietnamese spam detection based on language classification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10105066","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4578936/","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vietnamese spam detection based on language classification","confLoc":"Hoi An, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"074-79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053998S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562709","isNumber":"4578921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562709","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4578921","articleId":"4578936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4578943,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Dong Nguyen","id":"37292516400"},{"name":"Tuan Tran","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Tuan Tran","id":"38524530800"},{"name":"Thinh Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Thinh Nguyen","id":"37293066800"},{"name":"Bella Bose","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Bella Bose","id":"37272761000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2425-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2426-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578943","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Network coding","Broadcasting","Scheduling algorithm","Feedback","Wireless networks","Automatic repeat request","Routing","Random media","Multicast protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","broadcast channels","channel coding","media streaming","radio networks","random codes","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid ARQ-random network coding","wireless media streaming","real-time media broadcast","wireless channel","packet erasure rate minimization","uniform random network coding","hierarchical random network coding","packet scheduling policy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless media streaming","multimedia","network coding","distortion optimization"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes hybrid ARQ-random network coding frameworks for real-time media broadcast over single-hop wireless networks.

This paper examines the application of quasi-orthogonal STFCs (QOSTFCs) to enhance further either data rate or error performance in the proposed STFC MB-OFDM UWB systems. It was shown that QOSTFCs can provide significantly better error performance, compared to the conventional MB-OFDM UWB (without STFCs) as well as to the orthogonal STFCs (OSTFCs) of the same order, at the same data rate, without increasing the total transmission power. Equivalently, QOSTFCs can provide higher data rates with the same error performance, compared to OSTFCs.","doi":"10.1109/CCE.2008.4578967","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Communications and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Communications and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562709/4578921/04578967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCE.2008.4578967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578921","startPage":"252","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time-Frequency Codes in MB-OFDM UWB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the use of Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time-Frequency Codes in MB-OFDM UWB","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4578967/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10105095","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4578967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time-Frequency Codes in MB-OFDM UWB","confLoc":"Hoi An, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"252-257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092712S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562709","isNumber":"4578921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562709","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4578921","articleId":"4578967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4578986,"authors":[{"name":"Phan Hong Phuong","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, HCM City, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Phan Hong Phuong","id":"37087553381"},{"name":"Tong Duc Thanh","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, HCM City, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Tong Duc Thanh","id":"37087552275"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2425-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2426-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4578986","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","HEMTs","Equivalent circuits","Microwave devices","Circuit simulation","MODFETs","Microwave theory and techniques","Integrated circuit modeling","Optimization methods","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","high electron mobility transistors","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","HEMT model","high electron mobility transistors","S-parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microwave devices","millimeter-wave devices","monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC\u2019s)","optimization method","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578986","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new approach to extract parasitic elements of high electron mobility transistors (HEMT\u2019s).

At high penetration levels, volatility of wind power production could cause additional problems for the power system balancing functions such as regulation. This paper reports some partial results of a project work, recently conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The project proposes to mitigate additional intermittency with the help of Wide Area Energy Management System (WAEMS) that would provide a two-way simultaneous regulation service for the BPA and California ISO systems by using a large energy storage facility. The paper evaluates several utility-scale energy storage technology options for their usage as regulation resources. The regulation service requires a participating resource to quickly vary its power output following the rapidly and frequently changing regulation signal. Several energy storage options have been analyzed based on thirteen selection criteria. The evaluation process resulted in the selection of flywheels, pumped hydro electric power (or conventional hydro electric power) plant and sodium sulfur or nickel cadmium batteries as candidate technologies for the WAEMS project. A cost benefit analysis should be conducted to narrow the choice to one technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578994","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on the European Electricity Market","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on the European Electricity Market","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568047/4578994/04579075.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EEM.2008.4579075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM.2008.4579075","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of energy storage technologies for regulation services in electric power systems with significant penetration of wind energy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579075/","displayDocTitle":"On the use of energy storage technologies for regulation services in electric power systems with significant penetration of wind energy","htmlLink":"/document/4579075/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10114368","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of energy storage technologies for regulation services in electric power systems with significant penetration of wind energy","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063873S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568047","isNumber":"4578994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568047","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4578994","articleId":"4579075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4579109,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Amjady","affiliation":["Semnan University, Semnan, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Nima Amjady (M'97) was born in Tehran, Iran, on February 24, 1971.

However, price signal usually has a complex behavior due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy.

In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and neural network (NN) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is a modified version of the relief algorithm, proposed for the feature selection of price forecasting. Then, by means of the most relevant, explanatory and irredundant features, a neural network (NN) predicts the next values of the price signal. The adjustable parameters of the whole method are fine-tuned by a cross-validation technique. The proposed method is examined on PJM electricity market, forecasting day-ahead locational marginal prices (LMPs), and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods especially some other popular and validated feature selection techniques. These comparisons indicate the validity and robustness of the proposed forecasting method.","doi":"10.1109/EEM.2008.4579109","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568047/4578994/04579109.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on the European Electricity Market","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on the European Electricity Market","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM.2008.4579109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the relief algorithm and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the relief algorithm and neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10114402","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579109/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the relief algorithm and neural networks","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089794S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568047","isNumber":"4578994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568047","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4578994","articleId":"4579109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4579112,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Faias","affiliation":["Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute, ISEL/DEEA, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["S\u00e9rgio Faias (b. 1978) received the undergraduate (5-year) degree in Electromechanical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Setubal (2001) and Master degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Lisbon (2006), he is PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Technical University of Lisbon.","He is Assistant Professor at the Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute (ISEL) since 2001.","His topics of research include energy and environmental analysis of power systems, renewable energies, energy storage systems, electric and hybrid vehicle modeling and simulation."]},"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Faias","id":"37546084400"},{"name":"Patricia Santos","affiliation":["Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute, ISEL/DEEA, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Patr\u00edcia Santos (b. 1982) is concluding the undergraduate (5-year) in Electrical Engineering, Automation and Power Systems from the Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute.","She works at Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute since 2006, supporting Computational Lab classes.","Previously has worked in Management of Energy Projects in Portugal Telecom (2005\u20132006).","Her topics of research include power systems, renewable energies and energy storage systems."]},"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Santos","id":"38079001800"},{"name":"Fernando Matos","affiliation":["Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute, ISEL/DEEA, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Fernando Matos (b. 1978) received the undergraduate (5-year) degree in Electrical Engineering, Automation and Power Systems from the Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute.","His topics of research include energy and environmental analysis of power systems, renewable energies, green certificates and electricity tariffs.","He is Section Assistant at the Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute since 2005."]},"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Matos","id":"37955317100"},{"name":"Jorge Sousa","affiliation":["Lisbon Engineering Superior Institute, ISEL/DEEA, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Jorge A.

The storage system design and evaluation processes use a computational tool developed in MatLab to simulate the wind farm operation with an energy storage system and computes the remuneration tariff. The energy storage design settles on a system of 5 MW with 30 MWh. The simulation results show a 2.1% gain in wind farm tariff and a improved adjustment on generation to the typical electricity demand curve.

The pressure for realising and operating cost-efficient network structures increases as the regulation is based on comparison between network operators and the tolerable costs are set by the network operator with minimal costs. Computer-based optimisation methods, which will also be applied by Regulatory Authorities as part of the analytical cost models for calculating the efficiency of electricity and natural gas networks, provide the opportunity to identify long-term cost-efficient network structures, so called reference networks. Boundary conditions of natural gas networks, which concern the systempsilas technical safety and thus need to be regarded during network planning, are given by the rules set of each countrypsilas technical association for natural gas supply. Degrees of freedom for the optimisation are given by the choice of different network structures, the number and operating pressure of pressure stages and for the dimensioning of equipment. Therefore, computer-based optimisation methods are required for solving the extensive optimisation problem. An optimisation method for natural gas distribution networks based on Genetic Algorithms is proposed. The method is capable of calculating cost-efficient network structures with regard to all technical and economical boundary conditions and is also used by the German Federal Network Agency for calculating reference networks with minimum costs for given supply tasks. Exemplary results demonstrate the methodpsilas capability and the advantages given by the application of this method on long-term planning of natural gas networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on the European Electricity Market","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568047/4578994/04579119.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on the European Electricity Market","doi":"10.1109/EEM.2008.4579119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM.2008.4579119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term planning of natural gas networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural gas","Computer networks","Process planning","Optimization methods","Safety","Strategic planning","Genetic algorithms","Cost function","Boundary conditions","Maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["costing","genetic algorithms","natural gas technology","power system economics","power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural gas networks planning","Europe","regulatory authorities","cost-efficient network structures","reference networks","technical safety","natural gas supply","computer-based optimisation methods","natural gas distribution networks","genetic algorithms","German Federal Network Agency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long-Term Network Planning","Natural Gas Networks","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Long-term planning of natural gas networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10114412","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term planning of natural gas networks","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044253S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568047","isNumber":"4578994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568047","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4578994","articleId":"4579119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579124,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy G.

The proposed framework, referred herein to as convex analysis of mixtures of non-negative sources (CAMNS), is deterministic requiring no source independence assumption, the entrenched premise in many existing (usually statistical) BSS frameworks. The development is based on a special assumption called local dominance. It is a good assumption for source signals exhibiting sparsity or high contrast, and thus is considered realistic to many real-world problems such as multichannel biomedical imaging. Under local dominance and several standard assumptions, we apply convex analysis to establish a new BSS criterion, which states that the source signals can be perfectly identified (in a blind fashion) by finding the extreme points of an observation-constructed polyhedral set. Methods for fulfilling the CAMNS criterion are also derived, using either linear programming or simplex geometry. Simulation results on several data sets are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method over several other reported BSS methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04579130.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","startPage":"5120","endPage":"5134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convex Analysis Framework for Blind Separation of Non-Negative Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Convex Analysis Framework for Blind Separation of Non-Negative Sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222483","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579130/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Convex Analysis Framework for Blind Separation of Non-Negative Sources","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-chan-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08943S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4579130","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579131,"authors":[{"name":"Tanja Karp","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tanja","lastName":"Karp","id":"37298127000"},{"name":"Michel Kieffer","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, CNRS-SUPELEC-Universite Paris Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Kieffer","id":"37284765000"},{"name":"Pierre Duhamel","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, CNRS-SUPELEC-Universite Paris Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Duhamel","id":"37268164900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4579131","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579131","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Filter bank","Discrete Fourier transforms","Polynomials","Sparse matrices","Prototypes","Quantization","Background noise","Costs","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","combined source-channel coding","discrete Fourier transforms","error correction codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes","polynomial matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity-check matrix calculation","paraunitary oversampled DFT filter banks","joint source-channel coding schemes","error-correcting codes","parity-check polynomial matrices","oversampled discrete Fourier transform","parity-check polynomials"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint source-channel coding","oversampled discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter banks","parity-check matrix"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928934","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04579131.pdf","startPage":"5277","endPage":"5283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parity-Check Matrix Calculation for Paraunitary Oversampled DFT Filter Banks","abstract":"Joint source-channel coding schemes based on oversampled filter banks were recently proposed.

An important feature of the proposed method is that it is user parameter-free, unlike most previous proposals with a similar character. Throughout the paper we emphasize a covariance matrix fitting approach to spatial power estimation, which provides clear intuitive explanations of the typical performance of the methods in the class under discussion. In a somewhat separated analysis, of interest for signal estimation applications, we derive the beamformer that passes a signal of interest in an undistorted manner, has minimum white-noise gain, and whose output power equals a given value (that should be larger than the Capon beamformer output power, which is known to have the smallest possible value). The given power value, referred to above, can be either obtained with a spatial power estimation method or perhaps provided directly by the user.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","startPage":"5109","endPage":"5119","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04579132.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Spatial Power Spectrum and Signal Estimation Using the Pisarenko Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Spectral analysis","Array signal processing","Covariance matrix","Power generation","Matrix decomposition","Calibration","Proposals","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","estimation theory","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial power spectrum","signal estimation","Pisarenko Framework","beamforming method","calibration errors","Capon method","covariance matrix fitting approach","minimum white-noise gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Midway and beamformer design","modified diagonon loading","Pisarenko framework","spatial power spectrum estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"On Spatial Power Spectrum and Signal Estimation Using the Pisarenko Framework","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4579132/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10235316","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Spatial Power Spectrum and Signal Estimation Using the Pisarenko Framework","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-stoica-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078096S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4579132","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4579150,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The inter-die and intra-die variations in process parameters results in large number of failures in area constrained circuits such as SRAM cell, thus degrading the design yield. Adaptive repairing techniques such as adaptive body bias reduce the failure probabilities thus increasing the design yield. To apply this technique we have to distinguish between the dies from low-Vt process corners and those from high-Vt process corners.

In this paper, a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method is proposed by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by the state superposition principle and quantum parallelism, a framework of a value-updating algorithm is introduced. The state (action) in traditional RL is identified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can be represented with a quantum superposition state, and the eigen state (eigen action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is updated in parallel according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL such as convergence, optimality, and balancing between exploration and exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude and can speedup learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the performance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QRL algorithm for some complex problems. This paper is also an effective exploration on the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","volume":"38","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10202462","pubMedId":"18784007","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579244/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Reinforcement Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb05-dong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111766S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4623193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"4623193","articleId":"4579244","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4579269,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Goebel","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Goebel","id":"37268804600"},{"name":"Bhaskar Saha","affiliation":["Mission Critical Technologies at the Prognostics Center of Excellence, NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Bhaskar","lastName":"Saha","id":"37409189100"},{"name":"Abhinav Saxena","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Science at the Prognostics Center of Excellence, NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37287158500"},{"name":"Jose R.

The MWL consists of four InP-based microdisk lasers, coupled to a common SOI wire waveguide. The microdisk lasers operate in continuous-wave regime at room temperature, with a threshold current around 0.9 mA and a waveguide-coupled slope efficiency of up to 8 muW/mA, for a microdisk diameter of 7.5 mum. The output spectrum contains four laser peaks uniformly distributed within the free-spectral range of a single microdisk. While thermal crosstalk is negligible, laser peak output powers vary up to 8 dB for equal microdisk drive currents, as a result of loss due to coupling with higher order modes supported by the 1-mum-thick microdisks. This nonuniformity could be eliminated by reducing the microdisk thickness.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2008.926857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/4579303/04579336.pdf","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2008.926857","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact SOI-Integrated Multiwavelength Laser Source Based on Cascaded InP Microdisks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Compact SOI-Integrated Multiwavelength Laser Source Based on Cascaded InP Microdisks","volume":"20","issue":"16","accessionNumber":"10117995","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579336/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact SOI-Integrated Multiwavelength Laser Source Based on Cascaded InP Microdisks","sourcePdf":"20lpt16-vancampenhout.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069722S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4579303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4579303","articleId":"4579336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4579363,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Yousuf Saber","affiliation":["King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, KSA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Yousuf","lastName":"Saber","id":"37394621500"},{"name":"Suman Ahmmed","affiliation":["United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Ahmmed","id":"37394614900"},{"name":"Abdulaziz Alshareef","affiliation":["King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, KSA"],"firstName":"Abdulaziz","lastName":"Alshareef","id":"37889203000"},{"name":"Ahmed Abdulwhab","affiliation":["King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, KSA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Abdulwhab","id":"37728550000"},{"name":"Khondaker Adbullah-Al-Mamun","affiliation":["Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Khondaker","lastName":"Adbullah-Al-Mamun","id":"37086909904"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1550-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1551-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4579363","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":205},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579363","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained nonlinear optimization","modified particle swarm optimization","error-iteration dependent step length","constraint management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modified particle swarm optimization","constrained non-linear optimization","higher order complex function","appropriate fitness function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCITECHN.2007.4579363","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570852/4579351/04579363.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 10th international conference on computer and information technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th international conference on computer and information technology","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITECHN.2007.4579363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained non-linear optimization by modified particle swarm optimization","abstract":"This paper presents a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) for constrained non-linear optimization problems.

The color segment method is used to detect the area where a face may exist and searching for a face by the network is localized in that area. The face, with its orientation, is recognized using principle components analysis (PCA), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN) and Mahalanobis distance. The idea behind PCA is to reduce the dimension of the input vectors and extracting a feature vector. GRNN used as a function approximation network to detect whether the input image contains a face or not and if exists then reports about its orientation. The proposed system shows how GRNN can perform better than back-propagation algorithm and give some solution for better regularization. The proposed classifier system demonstrates advantages in: 1) better capability of approximation to underlying functions, 2) faster learning speed and 3) high robustness to outliers. The proposed technique overcomes one of the main problems for searching method reducing the computing time in two ways; firstly reducing the area to be searched and secondly reducing the scaling factor of the selected area of the image.","doi":"10.1109/ICCITECHN.2007.4579424","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 10th international conference on computer and information technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITECHN.2007.4579424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579351","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th international conference on computer and information technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570852/4579351/04579424.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient approach to rotation invariant face detection using PCA, generalized regression neural network and Mahalanobis distance by reducing search space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579424/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient approach to rotation invariant face detection using PCA, generalized regression neural network and Mahalanobis distance by reducing search space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579424/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10114581","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient approach to rotation invariant face detection using PCA, generalized regression neural network and Mahalanobis distance by reducing search space","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"NN_425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067501S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4570852","isNumber":"4579351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570852","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4579351","articleId":"4579424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4579438,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

Lifting scheme (LS) is implemented in designing the IDWT hardwire module that reduces the number of execution steps involved in computation to almost one-half of those needed with a conventional convolution approach. In addition, the LS is amenable to ldquoin-placerdquo computation, so that the IDWT can be implemented in low memory systems. The IDWT module does not comprise any hardware multiplier unit and therefore suitable for development of high performance image processor. The IDWT module has been developed in VHDL using Quartus II from Altera. The VHDL model is validated through simulation using ModelSim-Altera. Simulation results show the IDWT module can perform three levels inverse transform on a 256times256 forward transformed image in 8.7 ms. Latency of the system is calculated 50 ns and the power dissipation by the device is 662 mW. The IDWT module consumes just 57 combinational ALUTs and 60 logic registers of a Stratix II device, and runs at 300 MHz clock frequency, reaches a speed performance suitable for several real-time applications. Throughput in terms of input coefficients processed per second of the IDWT core is 7.13Msamples.

Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nFA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput.

This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nFAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10114870","htmlLink":"/document/4579526/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Advanced algorithms for fast and scalable deep packet inspection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced algorithms for fast and scalable deep packet inspection","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"358000081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113621S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4579516","isNumber":"4579517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579516","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4579517","articleId":"4579526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4579527,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Yu","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279172300"},{"name":"Zhifeng Chen","affiliation":["Google, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"38087880300"},{"name":"Yanlei Diao","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Yanlei","lastName":"Diao","id":"37890601400"},{"name":"T.

In this paper, we first show that memory requirements using traditional methods are prohibitively high for many patterns used in packet scanning applications. We then propose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage. Further, we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regular expressions into several engines, resulting in remarkable improvement of regular expression matching speed without much increase in memory usage. We implement a new DFA-based packet scanner using the above techniques. Our experimental results using real-world traffic and patterns show that our implementation achieves a factor of 12 to 42 performance improvement over a commonly used DFA- based scanner. Compared to the state-of-art NFA-based implementation, our DFA-based packet scanner achieves 50 to 700 times speedup.","publicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Architecture For Networking And Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Architecture For Networking And Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579516/4579517/04579527.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and memory-efficient regular expression matching for deep packet inspection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579527/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and memory-efficient regular expression matching for deep packet inspection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"10114871","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579527/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and memory-efficient regular expression matching for deep packet inspection","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"358000093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07418S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4579516","isNumber":"4579517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579516","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"4579517","articleId":"4579527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579594,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zou","affiliation":["School of Computer, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China","Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zou","id":"37649390700"},{"name":"Dan Feng","affiliation":["School of Computer, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China","Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289600400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3187-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4579594","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["File systems","Correlation","Servers","Analytical models","Character recognition","Compounds","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavior anomalies characterization","representative file system","file system design","interarrival times","file system workload self-similarity"]}],"abstract":"As one of the workload characteristics, the anomaly behaviorsin real workload have been recognized as a critical requirement for file system design.

And then the phenomenon of self-similarity which had been initially observed in network and disk I/O workload has also been visually and statistically observed in file system workload used in this paper. Furthermore, this property is further explored and we find that the self-similarity of I/O accesses in those sets of traces studied in this paper is mainly due to reads.

While IBA continues to evolve with more capabilities, it has yet to permeate the field of grid and pervasive computing across wide area. This requires a software infrastructure to take the full advantage of IBA networking mechanisms without being dwarfed by the long distances. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of InfiniBand transport services for their suitability to data transfer and message passing in the wide area. Three of the common InfiniBand transport services have been examined, including reliable connection (RC), unreliable connection (UC), and unreliable datagram (UD). Our analysis indicates that UC and UD are better suited to provide high bandwidth for MPI on wide-area networks (WAN). We have also demonstrated that the current existing MPI implementations, designed over RC and UD, can be tuned to provide improved MPI bandwidth on WAN. Furthermore, by developing a UC-based MPI implementa-tion, we have shown that, at a distance of 8600 miles, MPI over UC can improve MPI bandwidth by as much as 100%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579598/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579598/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10114917","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Analysis of InfiniBand Transport Services on WAN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Analysis of InfiniBand Transport Services on WAN","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"3187a233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082786S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579542","isNumber":"4579543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579542","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4579543","articleId":"4579598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579643,"authors":[{"name":"James S.

With the observation of the characteristics of image signal-processing pipelines, including the different requirements for different operation modes and the algorithmic similarity of image-processing tasks, a new coarse-grained reconfigurable image stream processor (CRISP) is proposed in this paper. The design idea is to devote low-cost hardware for the requirements in the preview mode and add some hardware resources for higher flexibility and processing capability in the picture-taking mode. With the coarse-grained reconfigurable stage processing elements designed for image signal-processing tasks and the reconfigurable interconnection unit with unified communication protocol, CRISP can be reconfigured as an efficient dedicated hardware in the preview mode, and it can act like a flexible DSP for the picture-taking mode with different contexts.

Indeed, a mobile node (MN) within an access network may cause excessive signaling traffic and service disruption due to frequent handoffs. The two latter effects need to be minimized to support quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of emerging multimedia applications. In this perspective, we propose in this paper a new mobility management scheme designed to track host mobility efficiently so as to minimize both handoff latency and signaling cost. Building on and enhancing mobile IP and taking advantage of MPLS traffic engineering capability, three mechanisms (FH-, FC- and MFC-micro mobile MPLS) are introduced. In order to assess the efficiency of our proposals, all protocols are compared. To achieve this, we develop analytical models to evaluate the signaling cost and link usage for both two-dimensional and one-dimensional mobility models. Additional mathematical models are also provided to derive handoff latency and packet loss rate.

A conventional fixed quantization (FQ) approach, which employs a fixed threshold for all sensors, incurs an estimation error growing exponentially with the difference between the threshold and the unknown parameter to be estimated. To address this difficulty, we propose a distributed adaptive quantization (AQ) approach, which, with sensors \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sequentially</i>\n broadcasting their quantized data, allows each sensor to adaptively adjust its quantization threshold. Three AQ schemes are presented: (1) AQ-FS that involves distributed delta modulation (DM) with a fixed stepsize, (2) AQ-VS that employs DM with a variable stepsize, and (3) AQ-ML that adjusts the threshold through a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation process. The ML estimators associated with the three AQ schemes are developed and their corresponding Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are analyzed. We show that our 1-bit AQ approach is asymptotically optimum, yielding an asymptotic CRB that is only pi/2 times that of the clairvoyant sample-mean estimator using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">unquantized</i>\n observations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Quantization for Wireless Sensor Networks: From Delta Modulation to Maximum Likelihood","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928956","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04579689.pdf","startPage":"5246","endPage":"5257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Quantization for Wireless Sensor Networks: From Delta Modulation to Maximum Likelihood","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4579689/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222486","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Adaptive Quantization for Wireless Sensor Networks: From Delta Modulation to Maximum Likelihood","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-fang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105155S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4579689","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4579691,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Adastral Park Research, University College, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4626086/4579691/4579691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shi Jin (S'06\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China, in 1996, the M.S. degree from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2007.","He joined the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, in May 2007.

We examine, in detail, three important special cases of the Rayleigh product MIMO channel: the degenerate keyhole scenario and the multiple-input single-output and single-input multiple-output scenarios, for which we derive insightful closed-form expressions for various exact and asymptotic measures (e.g., diversity order, array gain, and high SNR power offset, among others). We also compare the performance of transmit BF with orthogonal space-time block codes and quantify the benefit of exploiting transmitter channel knowledge in Rayleigh product MIMO channels.

A vertical Bell Labs layered space-time (V-BLAST)-based transmission structure is considered, where multiple data streams are independently encoded at the transmitter (i.e., horizontal encoding) and successively decoded at the receiver by the zero-forcing-based generalized decision feedback equalizer. A closed-loop V-BLAST extension is presented whereby transmit powers, rates, and antenna mappings for multiple data streams at different OFDM tones are jointly optimized at the receiver and then returned to the transmitter via the feedback channel. Two low-complexity algorithms for optimization of feedback parameters are proposed: one is based on the Lagrange dual-decomposition method and the other is a greedy algorithm. Antenna and tone grouping techniques by exploiting the MIMO-OFDM channel space-frequency correlations are also proposed to reduce the feedback complexity. Simulation results show that by only a moderate amount of feedback, the proposed closed-loop V-BLAST scheme improves substantially the throughput of the conventional open-loop V-BLAST scheme without feedback and, furthermore, approaches closely the MIMO-OFDM channel capacity achievable by the eigenmode transmission that requires the complete CSI at the transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04579720.pdf","startPage":"5191","endPage":"5203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching MIMO-OFDM Capacity With Zero-Forcing V-BLAST Decoding and Optimized Power, Rate, and Antenna-Mapping Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Antenna feeds","Transmitters","MIMO","Frequency division multiplexing","Channel state information","State feedback","Decision feedback equalizers","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO OFDM capacity","zero forcing","V BLAST decoding","optimized power","antenna mapping feedback","capacity approaching transmission schemes","channel state information","receiver","transmitter","multiple data streams","feedback channel","low complexity algorithms","Lagrange dual decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive coding and modulation (ACM)","convex optimization","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","partial channel feedback","spatial multiplexing","V-BLAST"]},{"kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","spatial multiplexing","V-BLAST","adaptive coding and modulation (ACM)","partial channel feedback","convex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Approaching MIMO-OFDM Capacity With Zero-Forcing V-BLAST Decoding and Optimized Power, Rate, and Antenna-Mapping Feedback","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4579720/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235320","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching MIMO-OFDM Capacity With Zero-Forcing V-BLAST Decoding and Optimized Power, Rate, and Antenna-Mapping Feedback","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-zhang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11055S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4579720","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579722,"authors":[{"name":"Sooksan Panichpapiboon","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Education, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4665392/4579722/4579722-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sooksan Panichpapiboon (S'05\u2013M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.","In April 2008, he was a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Information Engineering, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.

In other words, a time-critical message from a source should be able to propagate and reach all of the vehicles on the road segment without any delay due to the unavailability of the vehicles to forward the message. Clearly, this requires the road segment to have a certain number of vehicles equipped with communication devices. It is the task of a system designer to determine the minimum number of vehicles (i.e., the minimum penetration) necessary to form a connected network as well as the critical transmission range required to provide such connectivity. In this paper, we present an analytical framework for determining the connectivity requirements in distributing the traffic information in a self-organizing vehicular network. One- and two-way street scenarios are considered. In addition to the conventional perspective on connectivity, where the characteristics of the wireless channel are often neglected, our analysis offers a new view by taking important physical-layer parameters, such as fading, propagation path loss, transmit power, and transmission data rate, into consideration.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.929067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04579722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.929067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","startPage":"3333","endPage":"3340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectivity Requirements for Self-Organizing Traffic Information Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Connectivity Requirements for Self-Organizing Traffic Information Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312166","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579722/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectivity Requirements for Self-Organizing Traffic Information Systems","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-panichpapiboon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055786S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4579722","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579724,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengming Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhengming Fu (S'01) received the B.E. degree from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, the M.S. and M.Ph. degree in electrical engineering from Yale University, New Haven, CT, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is a research assistant affiliated with Yale E-lab.

The sensor reports a fall at ten times higher temporal resolution than a frame-based camera and shows 84% higher bandwidth efficiency as it transmits fall events. A lightweight algorithm computes an instantaneous motion vector and reports fall events. We are able to distinguish fall events from normal human behavior, such as walking, crouching down, and sitting down.

We examined the human response to jerkiness and jitter by considering different levels of strength, duration and distribution of the temporal impairments. Using videos with high picture quality, we found that for intermediate and high frame rate values video quality was similar independently from the duration of the frame rate decimation. On the other hand, for very low frame rates, overall video quality decreased as the duration of the impairment increased. The results also show that a reduction of the temporal resolution over the entire video does not necessarily lead to a significant loss of quality. Finally, the results of this study do not confirm the traditional thinking of lower-motion content receiving a higher quality than high-motion content for a given frame rate decimation factor. Using several motion descriptors, we observed that for a given sub-optimum frame rate, perceived quality does not necessarily increase with decreasing motion magnitude. More particularly, we found that perceived quality of head-and-shoulders content is severely affected by frame rate decimation although it is characterized by very low motion. Our results suggest that motion magnitude is not the only factor affecting perception of temporal artifacts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4604792/04579737.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2008.2001246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2008.2001246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Aspect of Perceived Quality in Mobile Video Broadcasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multimedia communication","Broadcasting","Video compression","Bit rate","Encoding","Jitter","Bandwidth","Humans","Quality assessment","Motion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","video communication","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile video broadcasting","subjective quality assessment experiment","temporal artifacts","content motion","human response","temporal impairments","motion descriptors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frame freezing","frame skipping","jerkiness","jitter","mobile video broadcasting","MOS","video quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Aspect of Perceived Quality in Mobile Video Broadcasting","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4579737/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180172","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Aspect of Perceived Quality in Mobile Video Broadcasting","sourcePdf":"tbc-huynhthu-2001246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123462S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4604792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4604792","articleId":"4579737","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579742,"authors":[{"name":"Bing-Fei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4579742/4579742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bing-Fei Wu (S'89\u2013M'92\u2013SM'02) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1959.

At the middle level, these two candidate motion vectors are employed as the center points for small range local searches. Then, at the original resolution, the final motion vector is obtained by performing a local search around the single candidate from the middle level. HMEA exhibits regular data flow and is suitable for hardware implementation. An efficient VLSI architecture that includes an averaging filter to downsample the image and two 2-D semisystolic processing element arrays to determine the sum of absolute difference in pipeline is also presented.

In order to avoid error-catalyzed artifacts from producing visible corruption of affected video frames, the use of error concealment at the video decoder becomes essential. The purpose of this paper proposes an efficient and integrated novel EC method for the latest video compression standard H.264/AVC, using not only spatially and temporally correlated information but also the tandem utilization of two new coding tools: directional spatial prediction for intracoding and variable block size motion compensation of H.264/AVC. Experiments performed using the proposed hybridization method of combining the above spatial and temporal estimation elements fulfilled the expectations of control-whole-scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed method offers excellent gains of up to 10.62 dB compared to that of the Joint Model (JM) decoder for a wide range of benchmark sequences without any considerable increase in time demand.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180173","htmlLink":"/document/4579743/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Hybridized Error Concealment for H.264","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Hybridized Error Concealment for H.264","sourcePdf":"tbc-huang-2001150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117773S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4604792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4604792","articleId":"4579743","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4579745,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Jager","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4598831/4579745/4579745-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mark J\u00e4ger received the M.Sc. degree in applied optics from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2003, the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in 2007.","During his Ph.D. work, he was with the Robert Bosch GmbH, Schwieberdingen, Germany, where he developed image processing algorithms for the automatic quality control of industrial laser welding processes.

One characteristic of the classification task is that anomalies are rare. This reflects the situation in the quality control of industrial processes, where error events are scarce by nature. As an additional restriction, class labels are only available for the complete image sequence, since frame-wise manual scanning of the recorded sequences for anomalies is too expensive and should, therefore, be avoided. The proposed framework reduces the feature space dimension of the image sequences by employing subspace methods and encodes characteristic temporal dynamics using continuous hidden Markov models (CHMMs). The applied learning procedure is as follows. 1) A generative model for the regular sequences is trained (one-class learning). 2) The regular sequence model (RSM) is used to locate potentially unusual segments within error sequences by means of a change detection algorithm (outlier detection). 3) Unusual segments are used to expand the RSM to an error sequence model (ESM). The complexity of the ESM is controlled by means of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The likelihood ratio of the data given the ESM and the RSM is used for the classification decision. This ratio is close to one for sequences without error events and increases for sequences containing error events. Experimental results are presented for image sequences recorded from industrial laser welding processes. We demonstrate that the learning procedure can significantly reduce the user interaction and that sequences with error events can be found with a small false positive rate. It has also been shown that a modeling of the temporal dynamics is necessary to reach these low error rates.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2001043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4598831/04579745.pdf","startPage":"1700","endPage":"1708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2001043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weakly Supervised Learning of a Classifier for Unusual Event Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579745/","displayDocTitle":"Weakly Supervised Learning of a Classifier for Unusual Event Detection","volume":"17","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408248","pubMedId":"18701402","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579745/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weakly Supervised Learning of a Classifier for Unusual Event Detection","sourcePdf":"17tip09-mjager-2001043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081304S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4598831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4598831","articleId":"4579745","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4579747,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Der Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4603036/4579747/4579747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Der Shieh (S'91\u2013M'98) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1984, the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 1986, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, in 1993.","From 1988 to 1989, he was an Engineer with United Microelectronic Corporation, Taiwan.

To speed up the computation, the Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm is used to relax the process of quotient determination, and the carry-save addition (CSA) is employed to reduce the critical path delay. In this paper, based on the inherent data dependency between the modular multiplication and square operations in the H-algorithm of modular exponentiation, we present a new modular exponentiation architecture with a unified modular multiplication/square module and show how to reduce the number of input operands for the CSA tree by mathematical manipulation. The developed architecture has the following advantages. 1) There is no need to convert the carry-save form of an operand into its binary representation at the end of each modular multiplication. In this way, except the final step to get the result of modular exponentiation, the time-consuming carry propagation can then be eliminated. 2) The number of input operands for the CSA tree is reduced in a very efficient way. 3) The hardware saving is achieved with very limited impact on the original critical path delay when designed with two distinct modular multiplication and square components. Experimental results show that our modular exponentiation design obtains the least hardware complexity compared with the existing work and outperforms them in terms of area-time (AT) complexity as well.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4603036/04579747.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000524","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Modular Exponentiation Architecture for Efficient Design of RSA Cryptosystem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579747/","displayDocTitle":"A New Modular Exponentiation Architecture for Efficient Design of RSA Cryptosystem","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579747/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10177439","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Modular Exponentiation Architecture for Efficient Design of RSA Cryptosystem","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi07-shieh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109351S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4603036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4603036","articleId":"4579747","onlineDate":"25 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579752,"authors":[{"name":"Tiziano Bianchi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e1 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4603104/4579752/4579752-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tiziano Bianchi (S'04\u2013M'06) was born in Prato, Italy, in 1976.

However, the approach introduced here presents two major novelties: 1) theoretically exact expressions for the estimation of the GG parameters are derived: such expressions do not require further assumptions other than the multiplicative model with uncorrelated speckle, and hold also in the case of a strongly correlated reflectivity; 2) a model for the classification of the wavelet coefficients according to their texture energy is introduced.

We present AlarmNet, a novel system for assisted living and residential monitoring that uses a two-way flow of data and analysis between the front- and back-ends to enable context-aware protocols that are tailored to residents' individual patterns of living. AlarmNet integrates environmental, physiological, and activity sensors in a scalable heterogeneous architecture. The SenQ query protocol provides real-time access to data and lightweight in-network processing. Circadian activity rhythm analysis learns resident activity patterns and feeds them back into the network to aid context-aware power management and dynamic privacy policies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2008","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579768/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117963","volume":"22","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Context-aware wireless sensor networks for assisted living and residential monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-aware wireless sensor networks for assisted living and residential monitoring","sourcePdf":"07WOOD.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069492S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"4579761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"4579761","articleId":"4579768","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579789,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Guilley","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM, Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI (UMR 514), Paris, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Guilley","id":"37317992900"},{"name":"Laurent Sauvage","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM, Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI (UMR 514), Paris, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Sauvage","id":"37393582800"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Danger","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM, Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI (UMR 514), Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Danger","id":"37275155000"},{"name":"Tarik Graba","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM, Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI (UMR 514), Paris, France"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Graba","id":"37399073200"},{"name":"Yves Mathieu","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM, Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI (UMR 514), Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Mathieu","id":"37543286500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3266-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4579789","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Power-Constant Dual-Rail Logic as a Protection of Cryptographic Applications in FPGAs","abstract":"FPGAs are often considered for high-end applications that require embedded cryptography. These devices must thus be protected against physical attacks. However, unlike ASICs, in which custom and backend-level counter-measures can be devised, FPGAs offer less possibilities for a designer to implement counter-measures. We investigate \"wave dynamic differential logic'' (WDDL), a logic-level counter-measure based on leakage hiding thanks to balanced dual-rail logic. First of all, we report a CAD methodology for achieving WDDL in FPGA. An experimental security evaluation of the DES (or triple-DES) encryption algorithm in WDDL shows that the usage of positive logic is mandatory to resist to straightforward attacks. Second, we discuss how to reduce the size overhead associated with WDDL. The efficiency of some synthesizers is assessed. In the case of DES, we provide with an original heuristic to obtain substitution boxes smaller than those generated automatically with legacy ASIC synthesizers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Logic gates","Cryptography","Clocks","Table lookup","System-on-a-chip","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-constant dual-rail logic","cryptographic applications","FPGA","embedded cryptography","wave dynamic differential logic'","logic-level counter-measure","leakage hiding","balanced dual-rail logic","CAD methodology","encryption algorithm","ASIC synthesizers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Side-Channel Attacks","Power Constant Logic","WDDL","Positive Dual-Rail with Precharge Logic","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579789","doi":"10.1109/SSIRI.2008.31","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Secure System Integration and Reliability Improvement","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Secure System Integration and Reliability Improvement","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579773/4579774/04579789.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSIRI.2008.31","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579789/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Power-Constant Dual-Rail Logic as a Protection of Cryptographic Applications in FPGAs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141091","htmlLink":"/document/4579789/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Power-Constant Dual-Rail Logic as a Protection of Cryptographic Applications in FPGAs","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"3266a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109966S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579773","isNumber":"4579774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579773","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4579774","articleId":"4579789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4579806,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shokrolah-Shirazi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shokrolah-Shirazi","id":"38318608000"},{"name":"Seyed Ghassem Miremadi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Ghassem","lastName":"Miremadi","id":"37298481500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3266-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4579806","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":806},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Integrated circuit modeling","Wires","Verilog","Microprocessors","Transient analysis","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault simulation","fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based fault injection tool","synthesizable Verilog HDL model","OpenRISC 1200 microprocessor","simulation-based fault injection"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an FPGA-based fault injection tool, called FITO that supports several synthesizable fault models for dependability analysis of digital systems modeled by Verilog HDL.

ICA based technique is based on independence of source signals and these conditions are satisfied in multi-user CDMA environment. Combining an ICA element to conventional signal detection reduces multiple access interference (MAI) and enables a robust, computationally efficient structure. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of differential entropy estimation and converges quickly. Bit error rate simulations of these algorithms has been given for different number of users, SNR and compared. The results show that RADICAL algorithm performs best at separating the source signals from the mixed CDMA signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.199","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579902.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved ICA Based Multi-User Detection of DS-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579902/","displayDocTitle":"Improved ICA Based Multi-User Detection of DS-CDMA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141165","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579902/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved ICA Based Multi-User Detection of DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035379S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4579908,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.D.

This leads to confusion of the test input and the expected output for a given test case. More over we also can miss some of the test cases due to lack of clarity in the test paths. To over come such sort of predictive modeling we propose graph theory based genetic approach to generate test cases for software testing. At first we will create a directed graph of all the intermediate state of the system for the expected behavior of the system. Then we will create a population of all the nodes of the graph as the base population of genetic algorithm. From this population we can find a pair of node the parents and perform genetic crossover and mutation on them for the getting the optimum child nodes as the out put. We should continue this process of genetic operation until all the nodes are covered or any of the nodes, which are visited more than once, should be discarded form the population. Then follow the same process for the generation of test case in the real time system. This technique will be more concrete in case of network testing or any of the system testing where the predictive model based tests are not optimized to produced the out put.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.79","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579914.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Software Test Case Generation Using Genetic Algorithm Based Graph Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579914/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Software Test Case Generation Using Genetic Algorithm Based Graph Theory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579914/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10141177","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Software Test Case Generation Using Genetic Algorithm Based Graph Theory","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041642S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4579916,"authors":[{"name":"Nirmal Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Birla Institute of Technology&Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Nirmal Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086150328"},{"name":"Mukesh Kumar Rohil","affiliation":["Birla Institute of Technology&Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Mukesh Kumar","lastName":"Rohil","id":"38548746400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3267-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"4579916","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":706},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Testing","Software","Genetic algorithms","Gallium","Encoding","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","object-oriented methods","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object oriented software unit testing","genetic algorithm","test case generation","genetic programming approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithms","Object Oriented Software","Testing","Test case Generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579916","abstract":"Genetic algorithms have been successfully applied in the area of software testing.

GAs are the best-known evolutionary techniques. The capability of GAs is applied to evolve the proper number of clusters and to provide appropriate clustering. This paper present some existing GA based clustering algorithms and their application to different problems and domains.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141180","htmlLink":"/document/4579917/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Based Clustering: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm Based Clustering: A Survey","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056277S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4579924,"authors":[{"name":"Kusum Deep","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Kusum","lastName":"Deep","id":"37598145400"},{"name":"Jagdish Chand Bansal","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Jagdish Chand","lastName":"Bansal","id":"37604735600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3267-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"4579924","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Equations","Algorithm design and analysis","Distance measurement","Heuristic algorithms","Gallium","Operations research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knapsack problems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["socio-cognitive particle swarm optimization","multidimensional knapsack problem","NP-hard problem","heuristic algorithm","velocity update equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Multidimensional Knapsack Problem","Velocity Update Equation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579924","abstract":"The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which is a generalization of the 0-1 simple Knapsack problem, is one of the classical NP-hard problems in operations research having a number of engineering applications. Several exact as well as heuristic algorithms are available in literature for its solution. In this paper, we propose a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm namely socio-cognitive particle swarm optimization (SCPSO) for solving the MKP. Comparing with the basic binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), this improved algorithm introduces the distance between gbest and pbest as a new velocity update equation which maintains the diversity in the swarm and makes it more effective and efficient in solving MKP. We present computational experiments with various data instances for fine tuning of parameters of SCPSO and to validate our ideas and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.163","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579924.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"360","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Socio-Cognitive Particle Swarm Optimization for Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Socio-Cognitive Particle Swarm Optimization for Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141187","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579924/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Socio-Cognitive Particle Swarm Optimization for Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085096S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4579926,"authors":[{"name":"Millie Pant","affiliation":["Department. of Paper Technology, IIT Roorkee, India","Department. of Paper Technology, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Millie","lastName":"Pant","id":"37603464400"},{"name":"Radha Thangaraj","affiliation":["Department. of Paper Technology, IIT Roorkee, India","Department. of Paper Technology, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Radha","lastName":"Thangaraj","id":"37602969200"},{"name":"Ved Pal Singh","affiliation":["Department. of Paper Technology, IIT Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Ved Pal","lastName":"Singh","id":"37349562700"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Quantifiable Quality of Service, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37297713700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3267-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"4579926","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random sequences","Particle swarm optimization","Benchmark testing","Probability distribution","Optimization","Space exploration","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical operators","particle swarm optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","Sobol mutation","systematic mutation operator","basic particle swarm optimization","mutation operators","random probability distribution","search domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Mutation","Low-discrepancy Sequence","Sobol Sequence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.35","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579926.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.35","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Using Sobol Mutation","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new mutation operator called the systematic mutation (SM) operator for enhancing the performance of basic particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm.

The use of radix-64 Booth encoder and selector for partial product generation by Sang-Hoon (Sang-Hoon Lee et al., 2002) reduces the number of partial product rows by six fold. The Booth selector selects one among X, 2X, 3X, 4X, 8X, 16X, 24X and 32X where X is the multiplicand. Before selection 3X computation must be completed which accounts for maximum delay because of carry propagation or carry look ahead addition of X and 2X. In this work this fundamental coefficient is generated as 4X-X using redundant binary (RB) arithmetic. This leads to zero delay for 3X computation as well as simplifies the partial product rows accumulation. This novel method of partial product generation decreases delay by 24% in comparison to last high-speed reported parallel multiplier (Sang-Hoon Lee et al., 2002) using radix-64 Booth encoding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Speed Radix-64 Parallel Multiplier Using a Novel Hardware Implementation Approach for Partial Product Generation Based on Redundant Binary Arithmetic","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.128","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579947.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A High-Speed Radix-64 Parallel Multiplier Using a Novel Hardware Implementation Approach for Partial Product Generation Based on Redundant Binary Arithmetic","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579947/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141209","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Speed Radix-64 Parallel Multiplier Using a Novel Hardware Implementation Approach for Partial Product Generation Based on Redundant Binary Arithmetic","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066632S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4579962,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

It enhances the energy-efficient and reliable operation of power system. Artificial neural networks have long been proven as a very accurate non-linear mapper. ANN based STLF models generally use back propagation algorithm which does not converge optimally & requires much longer time for training, which makes it difficult for real-time application. In this paper we propose a smaller MLPNN trained by genetic algorithm & particle swarm optimization. The GA training gives better accuracy than BP training, where as it takes much longer time. But the PSO training approach converges much faster than both the BP and GA, with a slight compromise in accuracy. This looks to be very suitable for real-time implementation.","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579972.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short Term Load Forecasting Using Neural Network Trained with Genetic Algorithm & Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.94","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Short Term Load Forecasting Using Neural Network Trained with Genetic Algorithm & Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141234","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579972/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short Term Load Forecasting Using Neural Network Trained with Genetic Algorithm & Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070034S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4579973,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhakar D.

So AI based arrhythmia recognition is effective for the management of cardiac disorders. Various techniques have been studied to classify arrhythmias. A simple wavelet transform based technique is proposed to classify normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and various cardiac arrhythmias including atrial premature contraction (APC), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), super ventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Wavelet transform may be performed on ECG data with normal sinus rhythm as well as various arrhythmias. Accuracy of most of existing methods for detecting NSR, APC, PVC, SVT, VT and VF is between 90% to 98%. Expanding the overall data set greatly reduces overall accuracy due to significant variation in ECG morphology among different patients. As a result, morphological information must be coupled with timing information, which is more constant among patients, in order to achieve high classification accuracy for larger data sets. An AI based detection and classification techniques coupled with wavelet based processing is suggested which will extend accuracy even to large data sets.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.228","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","startPage":"612","endPage":"617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Transformation, Artificial Neural Network and Neuro-Fuzzy Approach for CVD Detection and Classification An Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Transformation, Artificial Neural Network and Neuro-Fuzzy Approach for CVD Detection and Classification An Overview","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579973/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141235","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579973/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Transformation, Artificial Neural Network and Neuro-Fuzzy Approach for CVD Detection and Classification An Overview","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136542S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4579978,"authors":[{"name":"Mangesh S.

The membership functions used for fuzzying the patient data is sigmoidal and has been suitably optimized for correctly diagnosing the patho-physiological trend of the patient. Using the trained network, the chance of approaching critical health condition of a patient has been predicted with confidence. The system has been suitably tested with height, weight, glucose, urea, creatinine, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure data of patients taken at 10 days interval of time. Finally we study the effect of slight variation in the center and width of the sigmoids, used for fuzzification, on the reliability and the time instants at which we can predict the criticality.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.152","startPage":"665","endPage":"670","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579983.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, Simulation and Testing of an Optimized Fuzzy Neural Network for Early Criticality Diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Fuzzy sets","Medical diagnostic imaging","Blood pressure","Fuzzy neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","health care","medical computing","patient care","patient diagnosis","physiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized fuzzy neural network","early criticality diagnosis","computational intelligent systems","cognitive health care applications","neuro-fuzzy systems","patient patho-physiological trend","fuzzification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Criticality","fuzzy neural networks","medical diagnosis","pathophysiological","approximate inference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design, Simulation and Testing of an Optimized Fuzzy Neural Network for Early Criticality Diagnosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579983/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141244","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Simulation and Testing of an Optimized Fuzzy Neural Network for Early Criticality Diagnosis","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072655S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4579985,"authors":[{"name":"Shankar Bhausaheb Nikam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Shankar Bhausaheb","lastName":"Nikam","id":"37688311600"},{"name":"Suneeta Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Suneeta","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37304443600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3267-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"4579985","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":683},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture and Wavelet-Based Spoof Fingerprint Detection for Fingerprint Biometric Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Fingers","Histograms","Feature extraction","Image matching","Materials","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","image texture","neural nets","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet-based spoof fingerprint detection","fingerprint biometric systems","spoof fingerprint attacks","local binary pattern histograms","LBP","wavelet energy features","Pudil sequential forward floating selection","SFFS","neural network","support vector machine","k-nearest neighbor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fingerprints","Local binary pattern","Liveness","Texture features","Wavelets"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes an image-based system to detect spoof fingerprint attacks in fingerprint biometric systems. It is based on the observation that, real and spoof fingerprints exhibit different textural characteristics. These are based on structural, orientation, roughness, smoothness and regularity differences of diverse regions in a fingerprint image. Local binary pattern (LBP) histograms are used to capture these textural details. Wavelet energy features characterizing ridge frequency and orientation information are also used for improving the efficiency of the proposed method. Dimensionality of the integrated feature set is reduced by running Pudilpsilas Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) algorithm. We propose to use a hybrid classifier, formed by fusing three classifiers: neural network, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor using the ldquoProduct Rulerdquo. Classification rates achieved with these classifiers, including a hybrid classifier are in the range ~94% to ~97%. Experimental results indicate that, the new liveness detection approach is a very promising technique, as it needs only one fingerprint and no extra hardware to detect vitality.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.134","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579985.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579985/","displayDocTitle":"Texture and Wavelet-Based Spoof Fingerprint Detection for Fingerprint Biometric Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579985/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture and Wavelet-Based Spoof Fingerprint Detection for Fingerprint Biometric Systems","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035358S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4579989,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Recently, the PCA has been extensively employed for face recognition algorithms. It is one of the most popular representation methods for a face image. It not only reduces the dimensionality of the image, but also retains some of the variations in the image data. After performing the PCA, the hidden layer neurons of the RBF neural networks have been modelled by considering intra-class discriminating characteristics of the training images. This helps the RBF neural networks to acquire wide variations in the lower-dimensional input space and improves its generalization capabilities. The proposed method has been evaluated using the ATand T (formerly ORL) and UMIST face databases. Experimental results show that the proposed method has encouraging recognition performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579989/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10141250","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4579989/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis and RBF Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis and RBF Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086082S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4579998,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Dayal Udai","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, INDIA"],"firstName":"Arun Dayal","lastName":"Udai","id":"38189489700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3267-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"4579998","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hip","Trajectory","Robots","Leg","Spline","Foot","Gallium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","legged locomotion","path planning","robot dynamics","robot kinematics","search problems","splines (mathematics)","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum hip trajectory generation","10 DOF biped robot","single support phase","biped walking stability","swinging foot trajectory","B-spline path","zero moment point","real coded genetic algorithm","progressive search technique","kinematic chain","robot dynamic control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["B-Spline Trajectory","Dynamic Stability","Genetic Algorithm","Biped Robot"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4579998","abstract":"Stability of Biped walking has been an area of interest for researchers since decades. In this work an optimum hip trajectory is generated, taking its swinging foot trajectory that is a B-Spline path and physical parameters of the robot as input parameters. The objective is to minimize the deviation of zero moment point (ZMP) from the geometrical centre of supporting foot area. Genetic algorithm (GA) has emerged as a significant tool for ill faced engineering problems and can be utilized when the redundancy in solutions is exhibited. The process involves here real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), which uses progressive search technique to find optimum hip location, for ZMP to be within certain tolerance around the most stable point. The results are simulated with a biped having 10 degrees of freedom (DOF) comprising of kinematic chain of 11 links. The variation of various joint angles can be used as reference for dynamic control of any actual robot during single support phase which is the most critical of state biped walking. The output is a more anthropomorphic and stable robot with inherent flexibility offered by a B-Spline trajectory for its modification.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.49","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04579998.pdf","startPage":"739","endPage":"744","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Hip Trajectory Generation of a Biped Robot during Single Support Phase Using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4579998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Hip Trajectory Generation of a Biped Robot during Single Support Phase Using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141258","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4579998/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Hip Trajectory Generation of a Biped Robot during Single Support Phase Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070319S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4579998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
