Research has shown that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an anomaly detection method known to be viable for pinpointing the existence of anomalies in network traffic. Despite its recognized utility in detecting cyber threats, previous relevant research work has highlighted certain inconsistencies when the classical PCA method is used to detect anomalies in network traffic, resulting in false positives and false negatives. Specifically, it has been shown that the efficiency of the results are highly dependent on the nature of the input data and the calibration of its parameters. In classical PCA, the parameters have to be carefully selected in order to correctly define the normal and abnormal space. By obtaining real network traffic traces from a small enterprise and artificially injecting anomalies, we experiment with a modified PCA method to address the above shortcomings. The results of our experimentation are encouraging. The results indicate our modified PCA method may possess promising capabilities to efficiently detect network anomalies while addressing some of the limitations of the classic PCA approach.","doi":"10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990240","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Next Generation Networks and Services (NGNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Next Generation Networks and Services (NGNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963167/6990210/06990240.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating a modified PCA approach on network anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990240/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating a modified PCA approach on network anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14820551","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990240/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating a modified PCA approach on network anomaly detection","confLoc":"Casablanca, Morocco","sourcePdf":"Paper49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109732S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963167","isNumber":"6990210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963167","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6990210","articleId":"6990240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6990246,"authors":[{"name":"Marouane Sebgui","affiliation":["LEC Laboratory, Mohammed V University Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Marouane","lastName":"Sebgui","id":"37071136900"},{"name":"Sliman Bah","affiliation":["AMIPS research group, Mohammed V University Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Sliman","lastName":"Bah","id":"38556120000"},{"name":"Abdelaziz Berrado","affiliation":["AMIPS research group, Mohammed V University Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Berrado","id":"37320394200"},{"name":"Belhaj El Graini","affiliation":["LEC Laboratory, EMI, Mohammed V University, Morocco"],"firstName":"Belhaj","lastName":"El Graini","id":"37071263800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6608-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-6533"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-6525"}],"articleNumber":"6990246","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"abstract":"Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) is a technology that allows a unique identification of transmitters.

The problem of maximizing the expected channel usage can be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit. We present in this paper an online learning algorithm with the best known results to date for this problem in the case when channels are homogeneous and the channel statistics are unknown a priori. Specifically, we show that this policy, that we refer to as CSE, achieves a regret (the gap between the rewards accumulated by a model-aware Genie and the policy) that is bounded in finite time by a function that scales as O(log t). By explicitly learning the underlying statistics over time, this novel policy outperforms a previously proposed scheme shown to provide near-logarithmic regret.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990328.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"71","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online learning for multi-channel opportunistic access over unknown Markovian channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Bayes methods","Vectors","Tin","Conferences","Markov processes","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","radiocommunication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near logarithmic regret","model aware Genie","channel statistics","on-line learning algorithm","restless multiarmed bandit","expected channel usage","Markov chain","single secondary user","opportunistic spectrum access","unknown Markovian channels","multichannel opportunistic access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Restless Multi-Armed Bandit","Logarithmic Regret","Online Learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","displayDocTitle":"Online learning for multi-channel opportunistic access over unknown Markovian channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990328/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14822622","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online learning for multi-channel opportunistic access over unknown Markovian channels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p64dai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073301S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6990331,"authors":[{"name":"Parikshit Sharma","affiliation":["IBM Research Lab, India"],"firstName":"Parikshit","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085479869"},{"name":"Dipanjan Chakraborty","affiliation":["IBM Research Lab, India"],"firstName":"Dipanjan","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37278508100"},{"name":"Nilanjan Banerjee","affiliation":["IBM Research Lab, India"],"firstName":"Nilanjan","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"38580338700"},{"name":"Dipyaman Banerjee","affiliation":["IBM Research Lab, India"],"firstName":"Dipyaman","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"38105026500"},{"name":"Sheetal K Agarwal","affiliation":["IBM Research Lab, India"],"firstName":"Sheetal K","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37392832300"},{"name":"Sumit Mittal","affiliation":["IBM Research Lab, India"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Mittal","id":"37296540800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4657-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"6990331","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"abstract":"WiFi-based indoor localization solutions are actively in commercial use today. WiFi radio maps are typically created in an offline process, and location estimation is performed in realtime (online) using the maps. Both the radio map and the signal strengths provided as input during the online phase are affected by several dynamic factors resident in the environment. We call these \u201ccausality factors\u201d. Hence, the online location accuracy is far from the quality achieved in laboratory tests with training data, since the causality factors have varied in between. This impacts the quality expected by heterogeneous applications in real deployments. To address this issue, we investigate a novel online dynamic calibration methodology called KARMA. KARMA utilizes a one-time fingerprint of the space and systematically applies a set of causality calibration functions in real-time to compensate for the change in the factors, at test time. As a result, location providers can now significantly reduce the costly re-learning of the models for different factors, and improve real-time location prediction accuracy. Experimental studies demonstrate that KARMA's strategy, while keeping the fingerprinting task contained, can improve localization quality by a factor of 2x, compared to a typical one-state fingerprinting approach employed in many commercial deployments today. It also compares very favorably with an exhaustive all-state fingerprinting approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humidity","Accuracy","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Attenuation","Calibration","Hardware","Smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["KARMA","WiFi-based indoor localization","dynamic causality calibration","WiFi radio maps","offline process","location estimation","signal strengths","online phase","causality factors","online location accuracy","training data","heterogeneous applications","online dynamic calibration methodology","one-time fingerprint","causality calibration functions","location providers","fingerprinting task","localization quality","one-state fingerprinting approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990331","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990331","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990331.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990331","startPage":"90","endPage":"98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"KARMA: Improving WiFi-based indoor localization with dynamic causality calibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"KARMA: Improving WiFi-based indoor localization with dynamic causality calibration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990331/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990331/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14822623","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"KARMA: Improving WiFi-based indoor localization with dynamic causality calibration","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p90sharma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068055S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6990336,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Bejarano","affiliation":["ECE Department, Rice University, Houston, TX"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Bejarano","id":"37071862800"},{"name":"Eugenio Magistretti","affiliation":["ECE Department, Rice University, Houston, TX"],"firstName":"Eugenio","lastName":"Magistretti","id":"37423416900"},{"name":"Omer Gurewitz","affiliation":["CSE Department, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Gurewitz","id":"37295856800"},{"name":"Edward W.

To this end, MUTE exploits channel statistics to all the different users to predict whether a particular user's channel will remain sufficiently stable, thereby allowing the access point to preclude channel sounding before a MU-MIMO transmission.

Generally, the licensed spectrum is divided into N channels and most blind rendezvous algorithms are realized by the \u201cchannel hopping\u201d method where each user repeats a Global Sequence constructed on top of all the N channels. This global sequence based method may contain lots of redundant channels resulting in large rendezvous time especially when the number of available channels each user has only accounts for a small fraction of all the N channels. In this paper, we introduce the Local Sequence based rendezvous algorithms where the local sequence is only constructed on top of each user's available channels and different user's local sequence could be different. Our first local sequence based algorithm called LS can guarantee rendezvous in O(N) time slots for symmetric users (both users have the same set of available channels) and in O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) time slots for asymmetric users, which matches the best known results [11]. Our major contribution is the Modified Local Sequence (MLS) based algorithm which can guarantee an exponentially shorter rendezvous time than the best known results when the number of available channels each user has is relatively small. Extensive simulation results comparing with the state-of-the-art rendezvous algorithms corroborate our theoretical analyses.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","startPage":"194","endPage":"202","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990354.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local sequence based rendezvous algorithms for Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6990354/","displayDocTitle":"Local sequence based rendezvous algorithms for Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14822594","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local sequence based rendezvous algorithms for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p194gu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119867S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6990355,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Li","id":"37085432070"},{"name":"Jiang Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37279378300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4657-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"6990355","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Algorithm design and analysis","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Process control","Indexes","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication framework","wideband cognitive radio networks","newly joined secondary user","secondary user fast rendezvous"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new communication framework for wide-band cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990355","startPage":"203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990355","abstract":"Cognitive radio is a promising technology to solve the spectrum scarcity problem. In a cognitive radio network, a secondary user (SU) first senses a specific range of the spectrum to get its available channels and two SUs need to rendezvous on a common available channel to establish a physical link for communications. The spectrum band allocated for existing wireless services is very wide. However, when a SU works in wideband spectrum, the increasing delay and energy consumption in spectrum sensing and the time for two SUs to rendezvous will be a serious problem. All the existing rendezvous papers only focus on designing efficient algorithms for guaranteed rendezvous without considering practical communication issues caused by the wide-band spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel communication framework for wide-band cognitive radio networks without a common control channel. Our proposed framework can efficiently solve the problems coming from the wide-band spectrum and newly joined SUs. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve fast rendezvous and a high network throughput. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work with an effective solution to improve the communications in a wide-band cognitive radio network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14822660","htmlLink":"/document/6990355/","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"A new communication framework for wide-band cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new communication framework for wide-band cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p203li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114847S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6990365,"authors":[{"name":"Sriram N.

However, the link keys and encryption keys in Bluetooth are ultimately generated from a short 4 digit PIN, which can be cracked off-line. We develop an alternative for secure communication between Bluetooth devices using the symmetric wireless channel characteristics. Existing approaches to secret key extraction primarily use measurements from a fixed, single channel (e.g., a 20 MHz WiFi channel); however in the presence of heavy WiFi traffic, the packet exchange rate in such approaches can reduce as much as 200 x. We build and evaluate a new method, which is robust to heavy WiFi traffic, using a very wide bandwidth (B >> 20 MHz) in conjunction with random frequency hopping. We implement our secret key extraction on two Google Nexus One smartphones and conduct numerous experiments in indoor-hallway and outdoor settings. Using extensive real-world measurements, we show that outdoor settings are best suited for secret key extraction using Bluetooth. We also show that even in the absence of heavy WiFi traffic, the performance of secret key generation using Bluetooth is comparable to that of WiFi while using much lower transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990365","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","startPage":"293","endPage":"301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret key extraction using Bluetooth wireless signal strength measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secret key extraction using Bluetooth wireless signal strength measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990365/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14822615","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6990365/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret key extraction using Bluetooth wireless signal strength measurements","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p293nandhapremnath.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083067S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6990372,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37858750000"},{"name":"Andres Kwasinski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Kwasinski","id":"37280511500"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37085368546"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4657-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"6990372","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Femtocell networks","Vectors","Pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","game theory","quality of service","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","femtocell networks","self-learning approach","macrocell base station","MBS","femtocell users","QoS requirement","Stackelberg-game framework"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the energy-efficient power allocation for a two-tier, underlaid femtocell network. The behaviors of the Macrocell Base Station (MBS) and the Femtocell Users (FUs) are modeled hierarchically as a Stackelberg game. The MBS guarantees its own QoS requirement by charging the FUs individually according to the cross-tier interference, and the FUs responds by controlling the local transmit power non-cooperatively. Due to the limit of information exchange in intra-and inter-tiers, a self-learning based strategy-updating mechanism is proposed for each user to learn the equilibrium strategies. In the same Stackelberg-game framework, two different scenarios based on the continuous and discrete power profiles for the FUs are studied, respectively. The self-learning schemes in the two scenarios are designed based on the local best response. By studying the properties of the proposed game in the two situations, the convergence property of the learning schemes is provided. The simulation results are provided to support the theoretical finding in different situations of the proposed game, and the efficiency of the learning schemes is validated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation with stackelberg game in femtocell networks: A self-learning approach","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990372","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990372.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation with stackelberg game in femtocell networks: A self-learning approach","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990372/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14822670","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation with stackelberg game in femtocell networks: A self-learning approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p354wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134073S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6990385,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37071768600"},{"name":"Ji Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Li","id":"37899040200"},{"name":"Fan Ye","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, P.R.

Unfortunately, most of them overlooked the important factors of the vehicles' moving energy consumption and limited recharging capacity. These oversights may lead to problematic schedules or even stranded vehicles. In this paper, we study the recharging schedule that maximizes the recharging profit - the amount of replenished energy less the cost of vehicle movements - under these important constraints. We first derive the minimum number of vehicles needed for energy neutral condition and discover a set of desired network properties. Then we formulate the recharge schedule optimization into a Profitable Traveling Salesmen Problem with capacity and battery deadline constraints, which we prove to be NP-hard. We propose two algorithms to solve the problem. The first one is a greedy algorithm that maximizes the recharge profit at each step; the second one first adaptively partitions the network based on recharge requests, then forms Capacitated Minimum Spanning Tree in each partition followed by route improvements. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of proposed algorithms and validate the correctness of theoretical results through extensive simulations. Given a sufficient number of vehicles, the adaptive algorithm can keep the number of nonfunctional nodes at zero. Compared to the greedy algorithm, it reduces the percentage of transient energy depletion by 30-50% with 10-20% energy saving on vehicles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6990385/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14822608","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recharging schedules for wireless sensor networks with vehicle movement costs and capacity constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recharging schedules for wireless sensor networks with vehicle movement costs and capacity constraints","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p468wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077591S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6990390,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Mingyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"38235766100"},{"name":"Shouling Ji","affiliation":["ATL, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA","Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Shouling","lastName":"Ji","id":"37399190500"},{"name":"Meng Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Han","id":"37085577403"},{"name":"Yingshu Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yingshu","lastName":"Li","id":"37292401500"},{"name":"Zhipeng Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Cai","id":"38236646400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4657-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"6990390","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Cognitive radio","Interference","Sensors","Scheduling algorithms","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","integer programming","linear programming","radio networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless networks","spectrum uncertainty","complicated collisions","cognitive radio networks","CRNs","minimum latency data aggregation scheduling in wireless networks with cognitive radio capability problem","MLDAS-CR problem","approximation scheduling algorithm","integer linear programming","ILP","linear programming","LP","heuristic scheduling algorithm","guaranteed latency bound"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data aggregation scheduling in wireless networks with Cognitive Radio capability","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","endPage":"521","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990390","startPage":"513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990390","abstract":"Complicated collisions and spectrum uncertainty constrain the usage of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) on heavy transmission and time sensitive applications. On the other hand, data aggregation has been considered as an essential operation in wireless networks. A large amount of effort has been dedicated to the investigation of CRNs and data aggregation in wireless networks. However, the existing literatures rarely concentrate on how to use cognitive radio technique to promote the performance of data aggregation in conventional wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the Minimum Latency Data Aggregation Scheduling in wireless networks with Cognitive Radio capability (MLDAS-CR) problem. As the first try, an approximation scheduling algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Linear Programming (LP) is proposed. According to the simulation results, this method performances great, however, it is difficult to theoretically evaluate the solution. Therefore, a heuristic scheduling algorithm with guaranteed latency bound is presented in our further investigation. The performance of the proposed solutions are evaluated through extensive simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14822658","htmlLink":"/document/6990390/","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Data aggregation scheduling in wireless networks with Cognitive Radio capability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data aggregation scheduling in wireless networks with Cognitive Radio capability","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p513yan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074935S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6990391,"authors":[{"name":"Yuben Qu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yuben","lastName":"Qu","id":"38236293600"},{"name":"Chao Dong","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Dong","id":"37590306200"},{"name":"Shaojie Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, USA"],"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085534573"},{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"38107710900"},{"name":"Hai Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085537376"},{"name":"Chang Tian","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Tian","id":"37630294100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4657-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"6990391","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Receivers","Throughput","Sensors","Probability distribution","Tin","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near optimal network coding","secondary users","cognitive radio networks","high-priority primary users","transmission time","idle state","block-based transmission scheme","uncertain idle durations","confidential interval estimation method","multi-armed bandit","systematic network coding","data transmission","general block-based network coding","throughput gain","uncoded packets","optimal block size selection algorithm","transmission proportion","idle duration length","computational complexity","plain retransmission schemes","nonstochastic idle durations"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), secondary users (SUs) may employ network coding to pursue higher throughput. However, because SUs should not interfere with high-priority primary users (PUs), the available transmission time of SUs is usually uncertain, i.e., SUs do not know how long the idle state can last. Meanwhile, existing network coding strategies generally adopt a block-based transmission scheme, implying that all packets in the same block can be decoded simultaneously only with enough coded packets collected. Therefore, the gain induced by network coding may be dramatically decreased once a block cannot be decoded due to the arrival of PUs. In this paper, for the first time, we develop an efficient network coding strategy for SUs while considering the uncertain idle durations in CRNs. To handle the uncertainty of SUs' available transmission time, we first consider how to estimate the length of idle duration. For the case where the length of idle duration is stochastic, we employ confidential interval estimation (CIE) method to estimate the expected length of the idle duration. For the non-stochastic case, we utilize multi-armed bandit (MAB) to determine the idle durations sequentially. After obtaining the estimated length, we further adopt systematic network coding (SNC) in the data transmission of SUs. We find that SNC is more suitable for SUs' transmission than the general block-based network coding in the sense that it can reduce average perpacket delay without decreasing the throughput gain. However, the block size (also the proportion of uncoded packets to be sent) of SNC is hard to determine, due to the complicated correlation among the receptions at different receivers. To solve this problem, we propose an optimal block size selection algorithm for SNC (OSNC) to determine the transmission proportion of uncoded packets, under a given idle duration length. Due to its low computational complexity, OSNC can be used to make an online decision on the optimal block size with small delay. Simulation results show that, compared to traditional block-based network coding and plain retransmission schemes, our proposed scheme achieves highest performance for both stochastic and non-stochastic idle durations.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990391","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971893/6990316/06990391.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990391","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","startPage":"522","endPage":"530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards near optimal network coding for secondary users in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","displayDocTitle":"Towards near optimal network coding for secondary users in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990391/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14822640","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards near optimal network coding for secondary users in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p522qu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108693S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971893","isNumber":"6990316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971893","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6990316","articleId":"6990391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6990484,"authors":[{"name":"Arnab Biswas","affiliation":["Nanolab, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/7091971/6990484/biswa-2382759-small.gif","p":["Arnab Biswas (S\u201908) was born in Darjeeling, India.

In this paper, based on our recently reported real-time dual-reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA)based self-seeded adaptive optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OOFDM) transmitters, detailed experimental explorations are undertaken, for the first time, of the impacts of intra-cavity CD on 10-Gb/s OOFDM transmissions over 25-km self-seeded PON systems. The cavity length-dependent intra-cavity CD effect is identified to be one of the most prominent physical mechanisms determining the practically achievable performance of such PON systems. In comparison with a 10-m-long dual-RSOA self-seeded fiber cavity, the accumulated intra-cavity CD effect associated with a 1-km-long dual-RSOA self-seeded fiber cavity not only considerably broadens the optical spectral width of the self-seeding-created coherent-like optical signal but increases the signal relative intensity noise (RIN) by 4.8 dB (at a 2-GHz signal spectral region) as well. In addition, a further 1.1-dB signal RIN growth is also measured after the 25-km single-mode fiber (SMF) PON system transmissions. As a direct result, the dual-RSOA self-seeded PON with a 1-km-long fiber cavity suffers from a 2.2-dB power penalty degradation for 10 Gb/s over 25-km SMF intensity modulation and direct detection OOFDM transmissions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6998952/06990496.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra-Cavity Chromatic Dispersion Impacts on 10-Gb/s Optical OFDM Transmissions Over 25-km Dual-RSOA-Based Self-Seeded PON Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Optical fibers","Optical transmitters","Cavity resonators","Optical filters","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre dispersion","optical transmitters","passive optical networks","semiconductor optical amplifiers","spectral line broadening"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intracavity chromatic dispersion","optical OFDM transmission","dual-RSOA-based self-seeded PON systems","passive optical network","longitudinal modes","coherent-like optical signals","real-time dual-reflective semiconductor optical amplifier","frequency-dependent optical phenomena","self-seeded adaptive OOFDM transmitters","optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","intracavity CD","optical spectral width broadenening","relative intensity noise","single-mode fiber PON system transmissions","power penalty degradation","SMF intensity modulation","direct detection OOFDM transmissions","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","distance 25 km","size 10 m","noise figure 4.8 dB","noise figure 1.1 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-seeded RSOAs","intra-cavity chromatic dispersion","fiber optics systems and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]},{"kwd":["Self-seeded RSOAs","intra-cavity chromatic dispersion","fiber optics systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Intra-Cavity Chromatic Dispersion Impacts on 10-Gb/s Optical OFDM Transmissions Over 25-km Dual-RSOA-Based Self-Seeded PON Systems","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6990496/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14862510","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","externalId":"7200112","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"PIANO+","grantNumber":"620029"},{"fundingName":"Sino-UK Higher Education Research Partnership"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)"},{"fundingName":"NSFC"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Intra-Cavity Chromatic Dispersion Impacts on 10-Gb/s Optical OFDM Transmissions Over 25-km Dual-RSOA-Based Self-Seeded PON Systems","sourcePdf":"jphot-tang-2381636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09622S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6998952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6998952","articleId":"6990496","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990497,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-fan Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/6884875/6990497/chen-small.gif","p":["Yu-fan Chen received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University\n (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, in 2009 and the M.S. degree from the Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics (GIPO)\n at NTU, Taipei, in 2011.

This family of codes, referred to as RSPC codes for short, consist of the repetition (R) code, the single-parity-check (SPC) code and the codes obtained by time-sharing between the R code and the SPC code. The RSPC codes have extremely simple encoding and soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoding algorithms, hence can be integrated into the recently proposed block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) system. The BMST introduces memory across short codes by spatially coupling the generator matrices of the short codes. A distinguished feature of the BMST system is the simple relation between the asymptotic coding gain and the spatially coupling depth (encoding memory). Furthermore, the BMST-RSPC codes can share a pair of easily reconfigurable encoder and decoder. Simulation results show that the BMST-RSPC codes perform well (within one dB away from the corresponding Shannon limits) in a wide range of code rates.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2382588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06990513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2382588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Markov Superposition Transmission of Repetition and Single-Parity-Check Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block Markov Superposition Transmission of Repetition and Single-Parity-Check Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914533","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6990513/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program"},{"fundingName":"NSF"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Markov Superposition Transmission of Repetition and Single-Parity-Check Codes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ma-2382588-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046787S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6990513","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990514,"authors":[{"name":"Aliou Bamba","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University/iMinds, Ghent-Belgium"],"firstName":"Aliou","lastName":"Bamba","id":"37961276400"},{"name":"Maria-Teresa Martinez-Ingles","affiliation":["Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria-Teresa","lastName":"Martinez-Ingles","id":"38338992300"},{"name":"Davy P.

At a given frequency, the reverberation time is observed to be approximately constant for bandwidths up to 900 MHz (or larger). Moreover, the reverberation time decreases for increasing frequencies. Based on the theory of electromagnetic fields in cavities, a model to predict a room's quality factor, reverberation time value, and average absorption coefficient is developed for the first time. The validity and robustness of the model is investigated with data obtained for various environments, central frequencies, and bandwidths. As a validation, the model is applied to another room from 2 to 10 GHz and a maximum (resp. average) relative error of 22.30% (resp. 8.80%) was obtained with a rms error of 1.90 ns. Furthermore, good agreement is obtained with results reported in the literature with settings falling into the model range; scenarios for which relative errors smaller than 10% were computed. The results demonstrate that this approach is not only an accurate alternative to the reverberation time measurements and computations in indoor environments from 2 to 10 GHz, but also a viable route to link propagation mechanisms in indoor scenarios with reverberation chambers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6990514/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2015","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15018559","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Investigation of Electromagnetic Reverberation Characteristics as a Function of UWB Frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Investigation of Electromagnetic Reverberation Characteristics as a Function of UWB Frequencies","sourcePdf":"lawp-bamba-2382873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060296S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7024204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7024204","articleId":"6990514","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6990518,"authors":[{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Wan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085379272"},{"name":"Yangyi Liu","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yangyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085397815"},{"name":"Qian Xu","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085383566"},{"name":"Peng Pan","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Pan","id":"37546684200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6990518","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1656},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Training","MIMO","Antennas","Estimation","Fading","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonorthogonal pilot signal design","multicell massive MIMO system","minimal mean square error","MMSE channel estimator error variance","orthogonal pilot signals","training time slots","line packing","complex Grassmannian manifold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pilot signals design","non-orthogonal pilot signals","pilot contamination","MMSE channel estimator","multi-cell"]},{"kwd":["Pilot signals design","non-orthogonal pilot signals","pilot contamination","MMSE channel estimator","multi-cell massive MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the error variance of the Minimal Mean-Square Error (MMSE) channel estimator is analyzed, and its analytic formula is given.

While the notion of most salient object is sensible when multiple objects exist in a scene, current datasets for evaluation of saliency detection approaches often have scenes with only one single object. We introduce three main contributions in this paper. First, we take an in-depth look at the problem of salient object detection by studying the relationship between where people look in scenes and what they choose as the most salient object when they are explicitly asked. Based on the agreement between fixations and saliency judgments, we then suggest that the most salient object is the one that attracts the highest fraction of fixations. Second, we provide two new less biased benchmark data sets containing scenes with multiple objects that challenge existing saliency models. Indeed, we observed a severe drop in performance of eight state-of-the-art models on our data sets (40%-70%). Third, we propose a very simple yet powerful model based on superpixels to be used as a baseline for model evaluation and comparison. While on par with the best models on MSRA-5 K data set, our model wins over other models on our data highlighting a serious drawback of existing models, which is convoluting the processes of locating the most salient object and its segmentation. We also provide a review and statistical analysis of some labeled scene data sets that can be used for evaluating salient object detection models. We believe that our work can greatly help remedy the over-fitting of models to existing biased data sets and opens new venues for future research in this fast-evolving field.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2383320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7004755/06990522.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2383320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7004755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What is a Salient Object?

This paper focuses on the retrieval of significant wave height (SWH) and the mean sea surface level (MSSL) from a ground-based experiment using the interference pattern technique (IPT). Two different observables on the IPT are analyzed: the oscillation frequency and the angle where coherency is lost. The point where coherency in the reflection process is lost can be related to the Rayleigh criterion for smooth surfaces and helps to determine the SWH. Spectral analysis on the interference pattern helps to determine the MSSL. A three-month field campaign was performed on the \u201cPont del Petroli\u201d pier, Badalona, Spain, to see how the reflected GNSS signals were affected by coastal sea state and check previous assumptions. Results from this field experiment are shown, confirming that the SWH can be retrieved with accuracy of 6 cm and the MSSL with 4 cm. Estimations of both parameters are obtained every 30 min approximately.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6990586/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"14914423","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Retrieval of Significant Wave Height and Mean Sea Surface Level Using the GNSS-R Interference Pattern Technique: Results From a Three-Month Field Campaign","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n"},{"fundingName":"LIM/UPC"},{"fundingName":"Servei d'Infraestructura T\u00e8cnica (SITEC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrieval of Significant Wave Height and Mean Sea Surface Level Using the GNSS-R Interference Pattern Technique: Results From a Three-Month Field Campaign","sourcePdf":"tgrs-alonso-2371540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076941S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7032018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7032018","articleId":"6990586","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6990587,"authors":[{"name":"Tuyet Van Thi Le","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Tuyet Van Thi","lastName":"Le","id":"37085534985"},{"name":"Yun Hee Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yun Hee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280921800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6990587","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":639},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Covariance matrices","Interference","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","relay networks (telecommunication)","spectral analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data delivery","spectral efficiency","power scaling laws","channel state information","zero forcing relay beamforming","relay antennas","imperfect CSI","power efficiency","multipair massive antenna relaying system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive antennas","multiuser relay communications","power scaling law","spectral efficiency","zero forcing"]},{"kwd":["Massive antennas","multiuser relay communications","power scaling law","spectral efficiency","zero forcing"]}],"abstract":"We consider a multi-pair multi-antenna relay system, delivering data from multi-sources to their destinations simultaneously with the help of a massive antenna relay.

The proposed rectenna consists of a frequency reconfigurable microstrip antenna and a frequency reconfigurable rectifying circuit. Here, the use of the odd-symmetry mode has significantly cut down the antenna size by half. By controlling the switches installed in the antenna and the rectifying circuit, the rectenna is able to switch operation between 5.2 and 5.8 GHz. Simulated conversion efficiencies of 70.5% and 69.4% are achievable at the operating frequencies of 5.2 and 5.8 GHz, respectively, when the rectenna is given with an input power of 16.5 dBm. Experiment has been conducted to verify the design idea. Due to fabrication tolerances and parametric deviation of the actual diode, the resonant frequencies of the rectenna are measured to be 4.9 and 5.9 GHz. When supplied with input powers of 16 and 15 dBm, the measured maximum conversion efficiencies of the proposed rectenna are found to be 65.2% and 64.8% at 4.9 and 5.9 GHz, respectively, which are higher than its contemporary counterparts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7154538/06990591.pdf","startPage":"6006","endPage":"6010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2379588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2379588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7154538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Frequency Reconfigurable Rectenna for 5.2- and 5.8-GHz Wireless Power Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectennas","Rectifying circuits","Resonant frequency","Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductive power transmission","microstrip antennas","rectennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact frequency reconfigurable rectenna","wireless power transmission","rectifying antenna","microwave power transmission","frequency reconfigurable microstrip antenna","fabrication tolerances","parametric deviation","frequency 5.2 GHz","frequency 5.8 GHz","efficiency 70.5 percent","efficiency 69.4 percent","frequency 4.9 GHz","frequency 5.9 GHz","efficiency 65.2 percent","efficiency 64.8 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave power transmission (MPT)","reconfigurable rectenna","compact"]},{"kwd":["Compact","microwave power transmission (MPT)","reconfigurable rectenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Frequency Reconfigurable Rectenna for 5.2- and 5.8-GHz Wireless Power Transmission","volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6990591/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15289509","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271027 and 61331007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Frequency Reconfigurable Rectenna for 5.2- and 5.8-GHz Wireless Power Transmission","sourcePdf":"tpel-yang-2379588-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048015S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7154538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7154538","articleId":"6990591","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990592,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yao","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7219485/6990592/yao-small.gif","p":["Kai Yao was born in Jiangsu Province, China, in 1980.

Based on the ac component of capacitor voltage, the calculation model is founded. By sampling the pulse width modulation signal and output voltage, the method needs no current sensor and is effective for the CCM buck converter operating at different conditions. Implementation of the identification system is presented. The tests are carried out for different aged capacitors and ambient temperatures.

This is particularly severe for high dimensional data with small samples. To meet this challenge, this paper proposes a novel efficient framework to perform feature selection for graph embedding, in which a category of graph embedding methods is cast as a least squares regression problem. In this framework, a binary feature selector is introduced to naturally handle the feature cardinality in the least squares formulation. The resultant integral programming problem is then relaxed into a convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) learning problem, which can be efficiently solved via a sequence of accelerated proximal gradient (APG) methods. Since each APG optimization is w.r.t. only a subset of features, the proposed method is fast and memory efficient. The proposed framework is applied to several graph embedding learning problems, including supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised graph embedding. Experimental results on several high dimensional data demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the considered state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2015","publicationDate":"1 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15093218","htmlLink":"/document/6990594/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Feature Selection Framework for Graph Embedding on High Dimensional Data","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FT130100746"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Feature Selection Framework for Graph Embedding on High Dimensional Data","sourcePdf":"tkde-chen-2382599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140265S","chronDate":"June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7097121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7097121","articleId":"6990594","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990596,"authors":[{"name":"Gerardo Di Martino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Di Martino","id":"37586288700"},{"name":"Antonio Iodice","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Iodice","id":"37269037400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"6990596","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1008},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990596","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Azimuth","Standards","Marine vehicles","Antennas","Arrays","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oceanographic techniques","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ship azimuth size","CopSAR target-to-background ratio","standard SAR processing","sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies","SAR systems","coprime array beamforming concept","SAR acquisition mode","ship detection","ocean monitoring","geometric resolution loss","range swath","SAR technique","maritime surveillance","CopSAR concept","coprime synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coprime sampling","maritime applications","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]},{"kwd":["Coprime sampling","maritime applications","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique able, in the case of bright targets over a dark background, to reduce the amount of data to be stored and processed, and, at the same time, to increase the range swath, with no geometric resolution loss. Accordingly, the proposed approach can be usefully employed in ocean monitoring for ship detection. The technique consists of a new SAR acquisition mode and of very simple processing. It is based on the adaptation of the coprime array beamforming concept to the case of SAR systems: two interlaced sequences of pulses are transmitted, with two sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are equal to the Nyquist PRF divided by two coprime integer numbers. Each sequence is separately processed via standard SAR processing, and the two final aliased images are combined in a very simple way to cancel aliasing. We call the proposed approach \u201ccoprime SAR\u201d (CopSAR). Three different implementations are proposed, and the effectiveness of the CopSAR concept is demonstrated by using both simulated and real SAR data. It turns out that the significant data amount reduction and the range swath increase are only paid with a reduction of the target-to-background ratio and with the presence of a (nonstringent) limit on ship azimuth size.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7032018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2369035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7032018/06990596.pdf","startPage":"3110","endPage":"3123","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2369035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coprime Synthetic Aperture Radar (CopSAR): A New Acquisition Mode for Maritime Surveillance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","displayDocTitle":"Coprime Synthetic Aperture Radar (CopSAR): A New Acquisition Mode for Maritime Surveillance","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6990596/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"14914435","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coprime Synthetic Aperture Radar (CopSAR): A New Acquisition Mode for Maritime Surveillance","sourcePdf":"tgrs-iodice-2369035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082733S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7032018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7032018","articleId":"6990596","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6990597,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/7055204/6990597/luo-2382433-small.gif","p":["Feng Luo received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in information and communication engineering from the PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

For small UAVs, cooperation based on communication networks can effectively expand their working area. Although the UAV networks are quite similar to the traditional mobile ad hoc networks, the special characteristics of the UAV application scenario have not been considered in the literature. In this paper, we propose a distributed gateway selection algorithm with dynamic network partition by taking into account the application characteristics of UAV networks. In the proposed algorithm, the influence of the asymmetry information phenomenon on UAVs' topology control is weakened by dividing the network into several subareas. During the operation of the network, the partition of the network can be adaptively adjusted to keep the whole network topology stable even though UAVs are moving rapidly. Meanwhile, the number of gateways can be completely controlled according to the system requirements. In particular, we define the stability of UAV networks, build a network partition model, and design a distributed gateway selection algorithm. Simulation results show using our proposed scheme that the faster the nodes move in the network, the more stable topology can be found, which is quite suitable for UAV applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14981386","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990597/","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Gateway Selection Algorithm for UAV Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"2011THZ0"},{"fundingName":"Astronautics Supported Technology Foundation","grantNumber":"20134040056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371079, 61273214, 61271267 and 91338203"},{"fundingName":"Post-Doctoral Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Distributed Gateway Selection Algorithm for UAV Networks","sourcePdf":"tetc-jiang-2382433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097389S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7055204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7055204","articleId":"6990597","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6990599,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6990599/liu-2382632-small.gif","p":["\nJun Liu received the B.S. degree in electronic and information \nengineering from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi, China.

We consider that the actual channel is within the neighborhood of a nominal channel and formulate two optimization problems following the philosophy of worst-case robustness, i.e., minimizing the sum mean-square-error (SMSE) and minimizing the total transmit power for any channel realization in the uncertainty region. In order to efficiently find the solutions, we transform the original problems into suitable forms using the sign-definiteness lemma and then propose an alternating iterative algorithm with guaranteed convergence. To further reduce the computational complexity, the cutting-set method is developed, which alternates between transceiver design and channel determination steps. Moreover, some interesting extensions of the proposed methods are discussed, including various types of uncertainty models and transmit power constraints, nonlinear transceiver structure, and uncertain noise covariance. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust designs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2382632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06990599.pdf","startPage":"2218","endPage":"2231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2382632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Transceiver Design for Downlink Multiuser MIMO AF Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990599/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Transceiver Design for Downlink Multiuser MIMO AF Relay Systems","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039131","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990599/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB336600 and 2012CB316102"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4131003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422109"},{"fundingName":"Importation and Development of High-Caliber Talents Project of Beijing Municipal Institutions","grantNumber":"YETP0110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Transceiver Design for Downlink Multiuser MIMO AF Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2382632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188041S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6990599","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990602,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlong He","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6990602/he-2382971-small.gif","p":["\n\nChunlong He (S'14) received the M.S. degree in communication and information science from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2010 and the Ph.D. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014.","From September 2012 to September 2014, he was a Visiting Student with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA.

They include maximizing throughput under the constraint of the overall transmit power, minimizing the overall transmit power while guaranteeing the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) requirements, and maximizing energy efficiency (EE) under the constraints of minimum SE requirements and overall transmit power. The optimization problems for the first two criteria are signomial programming (SP) problems when considering the interference among the mobile stations (MSs), which are nonlinear nonconvex and do not lead to the closed-form solutions directly. Exploiting the nature of geometric mean, we transform the SP problems into geometric programming (GP) problems, which can be solved by turning them into convex problems. For the third criterion, using the theorem of fractional programming, we first transform the fractional optimization problem into an equivalent optimization problem in a subtractive form, which is an SP problem. We then obtain its solution by transforming the SP to the GP problem as we have done for the previous two problems. Based on these design criteria, three power allocation algorithms are developed for the downlink multiuser DAS. Depending on the application environments, we can use the first and second criteria to achieve the highest throughput and to save energy, respectively, while balancing throughput and energy consumption using the third criterion.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2382971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06990602.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2382971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","startPage":"5083","endPage":"5090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation Criteria for Distributed Antenna Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation Criteria for Distributed Antenna Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587052","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6990602/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"973 Program 2012CB316000"},{"fundingName":"The National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2012AA011401"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231009 and 61372100"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012738"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation Criteria for Distributed Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-he-2382971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124729S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6990602","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990617,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeil Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085576529"},{"name":"Maria del C.

To address these issues, we propose a mesh-to-volume registration approach, characterized by a progressive model deformation. Our model implements flexible weighting scheme for model rigidity under a multi-level neighborhood for vertex connectivity. This method induces a large-to-small scale deformation of a template surface to build the pairwise correspondence by minimizing geometric distortion while robustly restoring the individuals' shape characteristics. We evaluated the proposed method's 1) accuracy and robustness in smooth surface reconstruction, 2) sensitivity in detecting significant shape differences between healthy control and disease groups (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease), 3) robustness in constructing the anatomical correspondence between individual shape models, and 4) applicability in identifying subtle shape changes in relation to cognitive abilities in a healthy population. We compared the performance of the proposed method with other well-known methods\u2014SPHARM-PDM, ShapeWorks and LDDMM volume registration with template injection\u2014using various metrics of shape similarity, surface roughness, volume, and shape deformity. The experimental results showed that the proposed method generated smooth surfaces with less volume differences and better shape similarity to input volumes than others.

We provide bounds to the secrecy capacity for various possibilities on receiver feedback and show special cases where the bounds are tight. We show that, without any feedback from the receiver, the secrecy capacity is zero if the transmitter-to-adversary channel stochastically dominates the effective transmitter-to-receiver channel. However, the secrecy capacity is nonzero even when the receiver is allowed to feed back only one bit at the end of each block. Our novel achievable strategy improves the rates proposed in the literature for the nonhybrid adversarial model. We also analyze the effect of multiple adversaries and delay constraints on the secrecy capacity.

One of the main challenges in the control of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents while the capacitor voltages are maintained balanced. This paper proposes a control strategy for the MMC using finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). A bilinear mathematical model of the MMC is derived and discretized to predict the states of the MMC one step ahead. Within each switching cycle, the best switching state of the MMC is selected based on evaluation and minimization of a defined cost function. The defined cost function is aimed at the elimination of the MMC circulating currents, regulating the arm voltages, and controlling the ac-side currents. To reduce the calculation burden of the MPC, the submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing controller based on the conventional sorting method is combined with the proposed FCS-MPC strategy. The proposed FCS-MPC strategy determines the number of inserted/bypassed SMs within each arm of the MMC while the sorting algorithm is used to keep the SM capacitor voltages balanced. Using this strategy, only the summation of SM capacitor voltages of each arm is required for control purposes, which simplifies the communication among the SMs and the central controller. This paper also introduces a modified switching strategy, which not only reduces the calculation burden of the FCS-MPC strategy even more, but also simplifies the SM capacitor voltage balancing algorithm. In addition, this strategy reduces the SM switching frequency and power losses by avoiding the unnecessary switching transitions. The performance of the proposed strategies for a 20-level MMC is evaluated based on the time-domain simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2377112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7086423/06990622.pdf","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2377112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indirect Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control of Modular Multilevel Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990622/","displayDocTitle":"Indirect Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control of Modular Multilevel Converters","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15057480","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990622/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005416","fundingName":"Norges Forskningsr\u00e5d","grantNumber":"207690"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indirect Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control of Modular Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"tsg-vatani-2377112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076411S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7086423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"7086423","articleId":"6990622","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990627,"authors":[{"name":"Sean Huberman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6990627/huber-2382589-small.gif","p":["\nSean Huberman received his B.Sc. degree in engineering (first class \nhonours) from Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, in 2008, and his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from McGill \nUniversity, Montreal, Canada, in 2014.","His research interests include techniques of dynamic resource allocation and mathematical optimization with \napplications to wireless and wireline half- and full-duplex systems.","Dr. Huberman was the recipient of the Hydro Quebec Engineering Doctoral Award in 2009.

We present separate and joint precoding designs for sum-rate maximization and a theoretical analysis of when the separate design is optimal. The joint designs make use of Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). Extensive simulation results using both channel models and measured data show that the FDP structure can provide very significant performance gains over existing techniques for both SU- and MU-MIMO systems.

This is especially a problem for the tweets sentiment analysis. Since the topics in Twitter are very diverse, it is impossible to train a universal classifier for all topics. Moreover, compared to product review, Twitter lacks data labeling and a rating mechanism to acquire sentiment labels. The extremely sparse text of tweets also brings down the performance of a sentiment classifier. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised topic-adaptive sentiment classification (TASC) model, which starts with a classifier built on common features and mixed labeled data from various topics. It minimizes the hinge loss to adapt to unlabeled data and features including topic-related sentiment words, authors' sentiments and sentiment connections derived from\u201c@\u201d mentions of tweets, named as topic-adaptive features. Text and non-text features are extracted and naturally split into two views for co-training. The TASC learning algorithm updates topic-adaptive features based on the collaborative selection of unlabeled data, which in turn helps to select more reliable tweets to boost the performance. We also design the adapting model along a timeline (TASC-t) for dynamic tweets. An experiment on 6 topics from published tweet corpuses demonstrates that TASC outperforms other well-known supervised and ensemble classifiers. It also beats those semi-supervised learning methods without feature adaption. Meanwhile, TASC-t can also achieve impressive accuracy and F-score. Finally, with timeline visualization of \u201criver\u201d graph, people can intuitively grasp the ups and downs of sentiments' evolvement, and the intensity by color gradation.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2014.2382600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2014.2382600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/7097121/06990628.pdf","startPage":"1696","endPage":"1709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7097121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990628/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"TASC:Topic-Adaptive Sentiment Classification on Dynamic Tweets","volume":"27","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15093222","htmlLink":"/document/6990628/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2015","publicationDate":"1 June 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316303 and 2014CB340401"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61202213, 61232010, 61472400 and 61100083"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technology R&D Program","grantNumber":"2012BAH46B04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TASC:Topic-Adaptive Sentiment Classification on Dynamic Tweets","sourcePdf":"tkde-liu-2382600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127075S","chronDate":"June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7097121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7097121","articleId":"6990628","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990630,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlong Cai","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7355269/6990630/cai-2383388-small.gif","p":["\n\nYunlong Cai (S'07\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in computer \nscience from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2004; the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the \nUniversity of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2006; and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of \nYork, York, U.K., in 2010.","From February 2010 to January 2011, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Electronics and Communications Laboratory, \nConservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers (CNAM), Paris, France.

The base station (BS) and the MIMO relay station (RS) are both equipped with the same codebook of unitary matrices. According to each element of the codebook, we create a latent precoding matrix pair, namely, a BS precoding matrix and an RS precoding matrix. The RS precoding matrix is formed by multiplying the appropriate unitary matrix from the codebook by a power scaling factor. Based on the given CSI and a block of transmit symbols, the optimum precoding matrix pair, within the class of all possible latent precoding matrix pairs derived from the various unitary matrices, is selected by a suitable selection mechanism for transmission, which is designed to minimize the squared Euclidean distance between the pre-estimated received vector and the true transmit symbol vector. We develop a minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) design algorithm to construct the latent precoding matrix pairs. In the proposed scheme, rather than sending the complete processing matrix, only the index of the unitary matrix and its power scaling factor are sent by the BS to the RS. This significantly reduces the overhead. Simulation results show that, compared with other recently reported precoding algorithms, the proposed precoding scheme is capable of providing improved robustness against the effects of CSI estimation errors and multiuser interference.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2383388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7355269/06990630.pdf","startPage":"5677","endPage":"5687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2383388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MMSE Precoding Based on Switched Relaying and Side Information for Multiuser MIMO Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990630/","displayDocTitle":"Robust MMSE Precoding Based on Switched Relaying and Side Information for Multiuser MIMO Relay Systems","volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661996","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990630/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61101103"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Project of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MMSE Precoding Based on Switched Relaying and Side Information for Multiuser MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-cai-2383388-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136017S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7355269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7355269","articleId":"6990630","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990631,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongfei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7219485/6990631/wang-small.gif","p":["Xiongfei Wang (S'10\u2013M'13) received the B.S. degree\n from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2006, and the M.S. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology,\n Harbin, China, in 2008, both in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University, Aalborg,\n Denmark, in 2013.","Since 2009, he has been with the Aalborg University, where he is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department\n of Energy Technology.

The influence of coolant temperature, catalyst temperature, and air/fuel (A/F) ratio on fuel consumption characteristics and HC, CO, NOx emission characteristics are quantitatively analyzed first. Then, the DCM is derived by combining the individual cost maps with predefined weighting factors, so as to balance the potentially conflicting goals of fuel consumption and emissions reduction in the choice of operating point. The PSO is utilized to search the optimum APU operating point in the DCM. Finally, bench experiments under three typical driving cycles show that, compared with the results of the traditional static steady-state fuel consumption map-based APU operating point optimization approach, the proposed DCM and PSO-based approach shows significant improvements in emission performance, at the expense of a slight drop in fuel efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15400697","volume":"30","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6990636/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Operating Point Optimization of Auxiliary Power Unit Based on Dynamic Combined Cost Map and Particle Swarm Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2012AA111004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61104088"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operating Point Optimization of Auxiliary Power Unit Based on Dynamic Combined Cost Map and Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tpel-shen-2383443-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111773S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7219485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7219485","articleId":"6990636","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6990647,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7000613/6990647/6990647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Li (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electron information science and technique from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2007, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, USA.","From 2007 to 2010, he was a Research Assistant with the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, where his research concerned fractional-$N$ phase-locked loops (PLLs), clock data recovery (CDR), polar transmitters, and low-power impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) transmitters.

This path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue that has only started to be addressed recently: the resistance of this rapidly emerging technology to external attacks and, in particular, to spoofing. Spoofing, referred to by the term presentation attack in current standards, is a purely biometric vulnerability that is not shared with other IT security solutions. It refers to the ability to fool a biometric system into recognizing an illegitimate user as a genuine one by means of presenting a synthetic forged version of the original biometric trait to the sensor. The entire biometric community, including researchers, developers, standardizing bodies, and vendors, has thrown itself into the challenging task of proposing and developing efficient protection methods against this threat. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview on the work that has been carried out over the last decade in the emerging field of antispoofing, with special attention to the mature and largely deployed face modality. The work covers theories, methodologies, state-of-the-art techniques, and evaluation databases and also aims at providing an outlook into the future of this very active field of research.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2381273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2381273","startPage":"1530","endPage":"1552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/6705689/06990726.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometric Antispoofing Methods: A Survey in Face Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Biometric Antispoofing Methods: A Survey in Face Recognition","volume":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14860607","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2014","htmlLink":"/document/6990726/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CAM","grantNumber":"S2009/TIC-1485"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Bio-Shield Project","grantNumber":"TEC2012-34881"},{"fundingName":"TABULA RASA Project","grantNumber":"FP7-ICT-257289"},{"fundingName":"BEAT Project through the European Union","grantNumber":"FP7-SEC-284989"},{"fundingName":"C\u00e1tedra Universidad Autonoma de Madrid-Telef\u00f3nica"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Biometric Antispoofing Methods: A Survey in Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"access-galbally-2381273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.234862S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6705689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"202","xplore-issue":"6705689","articleId":"6990726","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6990747,"authors":[{"name":"Manli Zhou","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong, P.R.

However, the existing algorithms do not take into account the vast amount of biomedical knowledge from the literature and experienced researchers. This work proposes a novel feature selection algorithm, cLP, with the optimized binary classification accuracy. The proposed algorithm incorporates the biomedical knowledge as constraints in the linear programming based optimization model. The experimental data shows that cLP outperforms the other feature selection algorithms, and its constrained version performs similarly well with the unconstrained version. Although theoretically constraints will reduce the classification model performance, our data shows that the constrained cLP sometimes even outperforms the unconstrained version. This suggests that besides the benefit of including biomedical knowledge in the model, the constrained cLP may also achieve better classification performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"cLP: Linear programming with biological constraints and its application in classification problems","publicationTitle":"2014 8th International Conference on Systems Biology (ISB)","doi":"10.1109/ISB.2014.6990747","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 8th International Conference on Systems Biology (ISB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975302/6990418/06990747.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISB.2014.6990747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"cLP: Linear programming with biological constraints and its application in classification problems","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990747/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823459","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"cLP: Linear programming with biological constraints and its application in classification problems","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"ISB2014F27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109254S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975302","isNumber":"6990418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975302","xplore-issue":"6990418","articleId":"6990747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6990834,"authors":[{"name":"Luka Ambrozic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Luka","lastName":"Ambrozic","id":"37085373755"},{"name":"Maja Gorsic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Gorsic","id":"37085384726"},{"name":"Joost Geeroms","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Joost","lastName":"Geeroms","id":"37085393388"},{"name":"Louis Flynn","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Flynn","id":"37528527900"},{"name":"Raffaele Molino Lova","affiliation":["Fondazione don Gnocchi, Center of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Raffaele","lastName":"Molino Lova","id":"37085373658"},{"name":"Roman Kamnik","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Kamnik","id":"37323554400"},{"name":"Marko Munih","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Munih","id":"37281732600"},{"name":"Nicola Vitiello","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, The BioRobotics Institute, Pisa, Italy","Fondazione don Gnocchi, Center of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Vitiello","id":"38506597800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9932"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-223X"}],"articleNumber":"6990834","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":965},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"Restoring the mobility of transfemoral dysvascular amputees is essential to their rehabilitation process. Impeding the restoration of mobility, exhaustion is often the cause of noneffective deambulation of elderly lowerlimb amputees using a prosthesis as they use more energy for locomotion than younger amputees do. This article presents finite-state control of a novel powered prosthesis prototype for transfemoral amputees based on whole-body awareness. Intention detection was implemented through a noninvasive, distributed wireless wearable sensory system. The cybernetic lower-limb cognitive orthoprosthesis (CYBERLEGs) system was evaluated in a study involving three amputees. The subjects were able to walk with the prosthesis without training, showing accurate performance of the intention detection. The functionality of the CYBERLEGs approach was confirmed by gait pattern analysis and intention detection statistics.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/100/6990731/06990834.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MRA.2014.2360278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2014.2360278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CYBERLEGs: A User-Oriented Robotic Transfemoral Prosthesis with Whole-Body Awareness Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patient rehabilitation","Legged locomotion","Amputees","Medical robots","Prosthetics","Wireless sensor networks","Cybernetics","Wireless communication","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial limbs","gait analysis","medical robotics","patient rehabilitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CYBERLEGs","cybernetic lower-limb cognitive orthoprosthesis","user-oriented robotic transfemoral prosthesis","whole-body awareness control","rehabilitation process","finite-state control","wireless wearable sensory system","gait pattern analysis","intention detection statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"CYBERLEGs: A User-Oriented Robotic Transfemoral Prosthesis with Whole-Body Awareness Control","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6990834/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14811130","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CYBERLEGs: A User-Oriented Robotic Transfemoral Prosthesis with Whole-Body Awareness Control","sourcePdf":"21mra04-ambrozic-2360278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095021S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"100","isNumber":"6990731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"100","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6990731","articleId":"6990834","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6990894,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sajad Noohi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Sajad","lastName":"Noohi","id":"37085386517"},{"name":"Sayed Masoud Sayedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Sayed Masoud","lastName":"Sayedi","id":"37540779400"},{"name":"Armin Jalili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Jalili","id":"37601461900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6743-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6742-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6990894","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Arrays","Power demand","Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","image processing","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed low-power multitask digital vision chip","pixel architecture","SIMD parallel processing","binary image processing operations","low-power consumption","operating frequency","high-speed real time applications","CMOS technology","clock frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital vision chip","in-pixel image processing","high speed general purpose vision chip","robotic vision"]}],"abstract":"A new pixel architecture for the use in a multitask digital vision chip is presented.

Insufficient information in monocular images and the complicated nature of human motion, make the 3D human pose reconstruction challenging. In the motion capture system, a learning-based method is used to recover 3D pose of upper body (shoulder and elbow joint angles) from monocular images by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted from image silhouettes. The goal of proposed imitation learning system is generalization over multiple demonstrations and learning them. To achieve this goal, a set of joint angle trajectories used for training, first project to a latent space with PCA and then align temporally using DTW. Obtained signals are modeled using Gaussian distributions (GMM) and then generalized using Gaussian mixture regression. This system is evaluated qualitatively on human3.6m dataset and quantitatively on sequence of images captured by robot camera. The system is also implemented and tested on the Nao humanoid robot. Experimental results show that the proposed system is capable to effectively perceive, recognize and learn demonstrated gestures in real scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Second RSI/ISM International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974595/6990766/06990966.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"594","publicationTitle":"2014 Second RSI/ISM International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM)","doi":"10.1109/ICRoM.2014.6990966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRoM.2014.6990966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning of gestures by imitation using a monocular vision system on a humanoid robot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Estimation","Three-dimensional displays","Trajectory","Robot sensing systems","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","Gaussian processes","gesture recognition","humanoid robots","mixture models","motion estimation","pose estimation","regression analysis","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monocular vision system","vision-based imitation learning system","body gestures","single camera","robot head","forcing demonstrator","monocular images","complicated nature","human motion","3D human pose reconstruction","motion capture system","learning-based method","nonlinear regression","shape descriptor vectors","image silhouettes","latent space","PCA","Gaussian distributions","GMM","Gaussian mixture regression","robot camera","Nao humanoid robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imitation learning","human pose estimation","monocular vision","Gaussian mixture model","Gaussian mixture regression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6990966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Learning of gestures by imitation using a monocular vision system on a humanoid robot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6990966/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823232","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning of gestures by imitation using a monocular vision system on a humanoid robot","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"3382849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049429S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974595","isNumber":"6990766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974595","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6990766","articleId":"6990966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6991059,"authors":[{"name":"Evgeniy Mytsko","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, FSAEI HE NR Tomsk Polytechnic University Tomsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Evgeniy","lastName":"Mytsko"},{"name":"Andrey Malchukov","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, FSAEI HE NR Tomsk Polytechnic University Tomsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Malchukov"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6062-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6060-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991059","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Generators","Acceleration","Supercomputers","Distributed computing","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","message passing","microcomputers","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["technology MPI","OpenMP","parallel computing","distributed computing","generator polynomials search algorithm","computer program","Intel XEON 5150 processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["generator polynomial","distributed computing","search algorithm","error-correcting code","cores","supercomputer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991059","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975313/6991032/06991059.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFOST.2014.6991059","doi":"10.1109/IFOST.2014.6991059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991032","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptation of technology MPI and OpenMP to search for the generators polynomials","abstract":"The paper describes the usage of technologies of parallel and distributed computing OpenMP and MPI to find generator polynomials which is quite a tedious task.

At first, we calculate the secrecy multicast capacity of each group and investigate the impact of interferences on it. Then, we use zero-forcing (ZF) precoding at a relay to enhance the secrecy multicast capacity of each group removing the impact of interferences. Finally, we propose a scheme to improve the secrecy multicast capacity of each group making use of interference energy that already exists in the communication medium employing selective precoding at the relay. In the proposed scheme, interference provides an additional source of energy that enhances secrecy multicast capacity at each group without the need to increase the transmitted power. Our results show that exploiting free interference power, the performance of coexisting wireless multicasting can be improved without affecting the performance of each other.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure wireless multicasting through co-existing MIMO radio systems","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","doi":"10.1109/IFOST.2014.6991103","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975313/6991032/06991103.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFOST.2014.6991103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Secure wireless multicasting through co-existing MIMO radio systems","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991103/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823482","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure wireless multicasting through co-existing MIMO radio systems","confLoc":"Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"2014046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07043S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975313","isNumber":"6991032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975313","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6991032","articleId":"6991103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6991185,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Chamas Al Ghouwayel","affiliation":["CCE Department, Lebanese International University (LIU), Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ali Chamas","lastName":"Al Ghouwayel","id":"37320220900"},{"name":"Hussein Sharafeddin","affiliation":["CCE Department, Lebanese International University (LIU), Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Sharafeddin","id":"37085382919"},{"name":"Hussein Hijazi","affiliation":["Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Hijazi","id":"37391828900"},{"name":"Ali Alaeddine","affiliation":["Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Alaeddine","id":"37072890500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3166-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3165-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991185","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"abstract":"This paper investigates a 2-bit binary representation of the reliability messages generated by the Variable Node (VN) processor of Non-Binary Low Density Parity Check (NB-LDPC) Decoder. The NB-LDPC family of error correcting codes, considered as a potential alternative to both binary LDPC and convolutional Turbo Codes, suffers from high computational complexity as well as large memory requirements. In order to reduce temporary storage requirements for extrinsic LLR messages, we propose a coding technique based on the 2-bit representation of the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) messages generated locally in the VN processors. This simplified representation facilitates a size reduction of VN processor memory by 33% of the total memory size of extrinsic LLR messages. Monte Carlo simulations show that the 2-bit representation scheme has a negligible impact on the code performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and

carrier recovery and channel estimation for orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems over slow time-varying Rayleigh channel. In this paper, we propose a less complex algorithm based on a mixture PLL-based loop for estimating and tracking parameters in non-linear model. The algorithm can work with both the physical channel model (assuming time delays information) and the equivalent discrete-time channel model. In the algorithm, we combine two techniques the PLL-based loop and the Sequential Monte Carlo Sampling in order to track the channel complex gains and unknown carrier frequency offset (CFO). Afterwards, the channel matrix can be simply constructed, and then the data symbol can be estimated with free intercarrier interference (ICI) by using MMSE equalizer. It is shown that our algorithm has a good performance in terms of MSE and BER and approaches the BER of the ideal case for which the channel response and CFO are known. Moreover, the proposed mixture has less complexity compared to the mixture with kalman filter.","doi":"10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991186","publicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6978114/6991181/06991186.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixture PLL-based loop for joint CFO and channel estimation in slow time-varying OFDM environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991186/","displayDocTitle":"Mixture PLL-based loop for joint CFO and channel estimation in slow time-varying OFDM environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14823644","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991186/","conferenceDate":"29 April-1 May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixture PLL-based loop for joint CFO and channel estimation in slow time-varying OFDM environment","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072022S","chronDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6978114","isNumber":"6991181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6978114","xplore-issue":"6991181","articleId":"6991186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6991187,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud El Kobi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Lebanese International University, Bekaa, LB"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"El Kobi","id":"37088539555"},{"name":"Mohamad Zein","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Lebanese International University (LIU), Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Zein","id":"37085515987"},{"name":"Ali Chamas Al Ghouwayel","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Lebanese International University (LIU), Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ali Chamas","lastName":"Al Ghouwayel","id":"37320220900"},{"name":"Hussein Hijazi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Lebanese International University (LIU), Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Hijazi","id":"37391828900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3166-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3165-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991187","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Computational complexity","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short nonbinary LDPC codes","noniterative decoding algorithm","NB-LDPC codes","maximum-likelihood principle","variable nodes","check nodes","CN","VN","frame error rate","FER","ML search","near ML approach","potential codewords","EMS algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NB-LDPC codes","Maximum Likelihood search","EMS algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the decoding of short Non-Binary (NB)-LDPC codes of rate 1/2 using a non-iterative approach based on the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) principle.

The phenomenon, which tends to be correlated with the wing beat frequency (WBF), has been suggested as a feature for discrimination between bird species. Early studies were reported mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, however, several questions remain unanswered. Is such modulation prevalent, if so what causes it, how does it vary with aspect angle and signal to noise ratio (SNR), how sensitive is it choice of carrier frequency, and what is its potential as a feature for classification in a real scenario? This paper seeks to address several of these question. The discussion and results presented are based on analysis of X-band radar data and video of flying gannets. These measurements are supported with electromagnetic predictions of 3D gannet models.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Birds","Radar cross-sections","Frequency modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","echo","radar cross-sections","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["birds echo","periodic amplitude modulation","wing beat frequency","WBF","signal to noise ratio","SNR","carrier frequency","X-band radar data","flying gannet video","3D gannet model","electromagnetic prediction","radar cross-section"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991236","publicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975272/6986107/06991236.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude modulation on echoes from large birds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude modulation on echoes from large birds","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991236/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991236/","accessionNumber":"14823418","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude modulation on echoes from large birds","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1678.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053307S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975272","isNumber":"6986107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975272","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6986107","articleId":"6991236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association - EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6991250,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The sensors have individual signal sources, that are used both for transmission and reception. In addition to the non-ideal properties of single sensors, the usage of different signal sources for transmission and reception in each path leads to uncorrelated phase noise. In this paper, its influence on target position estimation is investigated. An in-system measurement methodology is proposed, which allows to evaluate the effect isolated and to derive phase-noise performance requirements for component design. In the system setup, the signal sources of the radar sensors are represented by an arbitrary-waveform generator (AWG). By this means, both ideally coherent and perturbed sensor signals can be generated for measurements. Starting from the evaluation of phase-noise-free signals, the degradation in target position estimation performance under the influence of phase noise is evaluated in measurements and compared to simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991252","publicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975272/6986107/06991252.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance degradation in cooperative radar sensor systems due to Uncorrelated Phase Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991252/","displayDocTitle":"Performance degradation in cooperative radar sensor systems due to Uncorrelated Phase Noise","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14832931","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991252/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance degradation in cooperative radar sensor systems due to Uncorrelated Phase Noise","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073606S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975272","isNumber":"6986107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975272","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6986107","articleId":"6991252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association - EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6991259,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Azodi","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Azodi","id":"38075825500"},{"name":"Uwe Siart","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Siart","id":"37374391500"},{"name":"Thomas F.

The transceiver, which is implemented in a Silicon-Germanium technology, simplifies the range measurements of targets by using two programmable 12-stage pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generators to generate two PRBSs for the transmit and the LO signals with a time offset that can be configured very precisely in the transceiver. Implemented in a current-mode logic topology, the PRBS generators can be operated with a clock rate of up to 4.25 GHz to enable a range resolution of 3.5 cm. The 4.25-GHz input signal used as a clock for the PRBS generators is multiplied by a frequency multiplication factor of 18 to create a 76.5-GHz carrier, on which the PRBSs are modulated. The transceiver achieves a phase noise of -105.3 dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset frequency, a transmit output power of 6.2 dBm, a receive gain of 24 dB and an input-referred 1-dB compression point of -14 dBm. Radar measurements with the proposed transceiver demonstrate the well-functioning system.","doi":"10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991265","publicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975272/6986107/06991265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986107","startPage":"293","endPage":"296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully-integrated 77-GHz radar transceiver using two programmable pseudo-random sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fully-integrated 77-GHz radar transceiver using two programmable pseudo-random sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14832923","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6991265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully-integrated 77-GHz radar transceiver using two programmable pseudo-random sequences","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047054S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975272","isNumber":"6986107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975272","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6986107","articleId":"6991265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association - EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6991273,"authors":[{"name":"Wentao Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Wentao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085367477"},{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085360223"},{"name":"XiaoYang He","affiliation":["China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"XiaoYang","lastName":"He","id":"37085348217"},{"name":"Yingyi He","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yingyi","lastName":"He","id":"37532430400"},{"name":"Ronghua Jian","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Ronghua","lastName":"Jian","id":"37085353305"},{"name":"Qi Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37653401100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7037-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991273","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Broadband antennas","Mutual coupling","Antenna radiation patterns","Dipole antennas","Metals","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","microwave antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays","Yagi antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identical planar quasiYagi elements","X-band array prototype","radiation patterns","active phased array","T/R modules","Wilkinson power divider","mutual coupling","antenna ground plane","front-back elements","broadband 2-D phased array","frequency 8 GHz to 12 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["phased array","quasi-Yagi antenna","mutual coupling","X-band range"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991273","doi":"10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuRAD.2014.6991273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986107","publicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975272/6986107/06991273.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A broadband 16-element 2-D phased array based on quasi-Yagi antennas","abstract":"In this paper, a broadband 2-D phased array based on 16 identical planar quasi-Yagi elements is presented.

However, the high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of transmitted signals is a serious disadvantage for OFDM communication systems. The focus of this paper is to propose a distortion-less PAPR reduction schemes for multi-carrier system. We laid out Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) and Selected Mapping (SLM) fundamentals as the building ground for the proposed schemes. The performance of the new schemes is measured using the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF). The simulation results show that the new proposed schemes have a better PAPR performance as compared to PTS and SLM. On the other hand, the price paid is a slight increase in the system complexity, as well as the side information transmitted.","doi":"10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991353","publicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6978114/6991181/06991353.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal based on SLM and PTS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991353/","displayDocTitle":"A new approach for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal based on SLM and PTS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14823659","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991353/","conferenceDate":"29 April-1 May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal based on SLM and PTS","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115197S","chronDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6978114","isNumber":"6991181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6978114","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6991181","articleId":"6991353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6991354,"authors":[{"name":"Afraa Khalifah","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Afraa","lastName":"Khalifah","id":"37085436547"},{"name":"Nadine Akkari","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Nadine","lastName":"Akkari","id":"37294161100"},{"name":"Ghadah Aldabbagh","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ghadah","lastName":"Aldabbagh","id":"37888817900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3166-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3165-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991354","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Handover","Macrocell networks","Mobile radio mobility management","Open Access","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","protocols","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense areas femtocell deployment","smart phones","traffic profiles","uplink traffic","packet transmission","uplink capacity","control plane dimensioning","femtocell interference","offloading","mobility management","protocols","dense areas planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Offloading","Mobility management"]}],"abstract":"In large open dense areas, high numbers of people use their smart phones to share pictures or data and download other information. This behavior creates traffic profiles that differ from those typically seen in the traditional network in less dense areas where less uplink traffic and less frequent packet transmission will be experienced. Thus planning for these dense network conditions must consider the uplink capacity and control plane dimensioning. Reducing the cell size has always been the best way to increase capacity. But smaller cells introduce the cost of more interference control, capacity and mobility management. This paper will compare the access types of femtocells in case of dense area networks and present the related challenges in terms of femtocell interference, offloading and mobility management. A comparison of existing schemes that consider the above mentioned challenges is presented and a road map is given to point out the main protocols and access type that should be adopted in case of dense areas planning.","doi":"10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991354","publicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6978114/6991181/06991354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991181","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dense areas femtocell deployment: Access types and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dense areas femtocell deployment: Access types and challenges","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991354/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 April-1 May 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14823650","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6991354/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dense areas femtocell deployment: Access types and challenges","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078858S","chronDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6978114","isNumber":"6991181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6978114","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6991181","articleId":"6991354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6991371,"authors":[{"name":"David Semaan","affiliation":["Faculty of Business Administration & Economics, Graduate Division"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Semaan","id":"37085427313"},{"name":"Atef Harb","affiliation":["Faculty of Business Administration & Economics, Graduate Division"],"firstName":"Atef","lastName":"Harb","id":"37085441189"},{"name":"Abdallah Kassem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and computer and communication Engineering, Notre Dame University Louaize"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Kassem","id":"37297312200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3166-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3165-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991371","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Exchange rates","Artificial neural networks","Forecasting","Biological system modeling","Mathematical model","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","exchange rates","financial management","macroeconomics","neural nets","regression analysis","supply and demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exchange rates forecasting","artificial neural networks","regression","supply and demand","ANN","artificial intelligence","macro economics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","Balance of Payments","Exchange Rate","Forecasting","Inflation","Interest Rate","Multilayer Perceptron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991371","abstract":"Most exchange rates are volatile and mainly rely on the principle of supply and demand. Millions of people around the world are influenced, one way or another, by the variation in exchange rates. In this research we demonstrate that the Artificial Intelligence, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), can improve the accuracy of forecasting exchange rates compared to statistical techniques such as regression. When we compared the results from regression and artificial neural network, it was clear that the ANN outperformed regression in forecasting exchange rates. Moreover, it became clear that using ANNs instead of regression for forecasting exchange rates is rewarding and necessary because the average error given by an ANN is smaller than the average error given by regression. Accuracy in forecasting became a major issue and not a minor detail. It was the combination between Artificial Intelligence and Macro Economics that made these two models come into reality, making it possible to use computer sciences and engineering fields in the service of an economical problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991371","pdfPath":"/iel7/6978114/6991181/06991371.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","displayPublicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","publicationTitle":"The Third International Conference on e-Technologies and Networks for Development (ICeND2014)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting exchange rates: Artificial neural networks vs regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting exchange rates: Artificial neural networks vs regression","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14823631","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6991371/","conferenceDate":"29 April-1 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting exchange rates: Artificial neural networks vs regression","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057813S","chronDate":"April 29 2014-May 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6978114","isNumber":"6991181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6978114","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6991181","articleId":"6991371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6991377,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Ingles Da Silva","affiliation":["UNIVEM, University Center Euripides Marilia, Marilia, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Alexandre Ingles","lastName":"Da Silva","id":"37085558549"},{"name":"Fabio Dacencio Pereira","affiliation":["UNIVEM, University Center Euripides Marilia, Marilia, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fabio Dacencio","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37085549436"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3166-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3165-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991377","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Power demand","Clocks","Synchronization","Energy consumption","Receivers","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["based-FPGA dynamic power management technique","wireless sensor network","low-power system","low-power circuit","clock domain minimization","balanced operation mode","power consumption","sensor nodes","reliability","eASIC Nextreme-2 architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor network","Dynamic Power Management","logical architecture","low-power","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Technologies like FPGA appear with features to be explored as implementation of low-power system.

In this paper we present a queuing model that takes reliable data scheduler into account and computes performance characteristics like mean waiting time, mean traversal time, utilization, throughput, and mean queue length. Reliable data will be aware and dynamically scheduled in order to make the decision after the arrival of requested job. In addition to these scheduling algorithms we investigate the resource allocation solutions with a distributed Erlang multimedia data. A queuing model is employed in order to study, analyze, and evaluate the performance of each scheduling algorithm. An approximation method based on Mean Value Analysis (MVA) in queuing theory will be introduced. Results regarding performance metrics from both simulation and approximation then are compared. The difference between simulation's and approximation method is insignificant. Results as well confirm that schedulers can be effectively applied in a Cloud Computing environment in terms of fairness and load balancing centric.","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974755/6991351/06991394.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)","doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2014.6991394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2014.6991394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of reliable data scheduling for Erlang multimedia in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Approximation methods","Measurement","Multimedia communication","Servers","Computational modeling","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","multimedia computing","performance evaluation","queueing theory","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","reliable data scheduling algorithm","real-time computer network","broadband network","distributed network","queuing model","reliable data scheduler","resource allocation solutions","distributed Erlang multimedia data","approximation method","mean value analysis","MVA","queuing theory","performance metrics","cloud computing environment","load balancing centric"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["queuing model","reliable data","cloud computing","scheduling","load balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 1 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of reliable data scheduling for Erlang multimedia in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991394/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823385","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of reliable data scheduling for Erlang multimedia in cloud computing","confLoc":"Phitsanulok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101797S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974755","isNumber":"6991351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974755","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6991351","articleId":"6991394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6991399,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuchen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085548693"},{"name":"Zhijun Ding","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Ding","id":"37291540700"},{"name":"Haichun Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haichun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085558180"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5421-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991399","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Licenses","Text mining","Context","Cleaning","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","feature extraction","search engines","text analysis","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PEWP","process extraction based on word position in documents","search engine","text mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["process extraction","text mining","word position"]}],"abstract":"Search engine is a popular and beneficial tool to help people quickly find required information.

Rather than existing, commercial relational databases such as Oracle and IBM-DB2, this system is able to provide us with high availability and performance at low cost. It is also able to manage unstructured data and store big data in distributed environment. In addition, using data access APIs, target data is quickly retrieved from our proposed system. To utilize our prototype system, we also propose an energy consumption prediction model based on penalized linear regression-based map/reduce algorithms. Then, we exploit discriminate features with respect to time stamp. Finally, given a time stamp (e.g., 2014-01-05 12:01:08), our proposed learning model will give us a predicted value about the energy usage (e.g., 90 watt) at that time. According to our experimental results obtained from about 7.5 million records, each of which consists of an energy usage and time stamp during three months in 2014, it turns out that our prediction model can predict real values that are very close to actual energy usage at that time, and is about 1.72 times faster than in a single machine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991404/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 1 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14823382","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6991404/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A big data management system for energy consumption prediction models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A big data management system for energy consumption prediction models","confLoc":"Phitsanulok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05949S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974755","isNumber":"6991351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974755","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6991351","articleId":"6991404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6991421,"authors":[{"name":"Sirinya On-at","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Sirinya","lastName":"On-at","id":"37085350889"},{"name":"Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Canut","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Fran\u00e7oise","lastName":"Canut","id":"37352890700"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 P\u00e9ninou","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"P\u00e9ninou","id":"37540818800"},{"name":"Florence S\u00e8des","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Florence","lastName":"S\u00e8des","id":"37319595100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5421-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991421","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991421","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communities","Social network services","Buildings","Sociology","Context","Data mining","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","sampling methods","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse egocentric networks","snowball sampling","link prediction","user profile modeling process","user social network information","information mining","DBLP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["User modeling","social network analysis","link prediction","snowball sampling"]}],"abstract":"Several studies demonstrate effectiveness and benefits of using user's social network information to enrich user's profile. In this context, one of our contributions [1] proposes an algorithm enabling to compute user's interests using information from egocentric network extracted communities. Therefore, mining information from a small or a sparse network remains challenging because there is not enough information to enrich a relevant user's profile. So, one of the main lock is to cope with the lack of information that is considered as an important issue to extract a relevant community and could lead to misinterpretations in the user's profile modeling process. We aim to improve the performance of [1], regarding the lack of information problem, in the case of a small and/or a sparse network. We propose to add more information (i.e. relations) into user's network before extracting the data and enriching his profile. To achieve this enrichment, we suggest using snowball sampling technique to identify and add user's distance-2 neighbors (friends of a friend) into the user's egocentric network. Our experimentation conducted in DBLP demonstrates the interest of node integration into small and sparse network. This leads to the study of link prediction that enables us to provide better performances and results compared to the existing work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2014.6991421","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974755/6991351/06991421.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2014.6991421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deriving user's profile from sparse egocentric networks: Using snowball sampling and link prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 1 2014","displayDocTitle":"Deriving user's profile from sparse egocentric networks: Using snowball sampling and link prediction","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6991421/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823357","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991421/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deriving user's profile from sparse egocentric networks: Using snowball sampling and link prediction","confLoc":"Phitsanulok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057951S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974755","isNumber":"6991351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974755","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6991351","articleId":"6991421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6991427,"authors":[{"name":"Maleerat Sodanil","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Maleerat","lastName":"Sodanil","id":"37062029800"},{"name":"Paiboon Chatthong","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Paiboon","lastName":"Chatthong","id":"37085462322"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5421-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6991427","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solids","Forecasting","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Time series analysis","Mathematical model","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","environmental science computing","forecasting theory","neural nets","planning (artificial intelligence)","time series","waste management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","time series analysis forecasting","solid waste","Bangkok","municipal environmental problem","planning","predictive analytic tool","Rapidminer","backpropagation algorithm","MSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time Series Forecasting","Artificial Neural Network","Solid Waste in Bangkok"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2014.6991427","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974755/6991351/06991427.pdf","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)","startPage":"16","endPage":"20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2014.6991427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network-based time series analysis forecasting for the amount of solid waste in Bangkok","abstract":"Solid waste is a municipal environmental problem which difficult to manage.

Cellular (e.g., 3GPP LTE) network assistance can automate user/service discovery and connection establishment procedures, as well as enable secure D2D connectivity between proximate users. Currently, assisted direct connectivity is only available in the form of unlicensed-band protocols (e.g., WiFi Direct), which motivates research on understanding its practical limitations with realistic distributions of users and content. Whereas there are concerns that D2D communication alone may not be efficient due to limited content availability, in this paper, we advocate the use of network coding to upgrade assisted proximate communication and make it realize its full potential. In particular, we demonstrate that even simpler network coding techniques are capable to significantly improve the degrees of content availability for communicating users and thus enhance offloading performance under realistic constraints. Inspired by the recent popularity of wireless content distribution systems over D2D caches, we contribute a practical methodology for assisted data caching and distribution, mindful of the state-of-the-art D2D technology.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7055202/06991504.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Practical Limitations of Network Coding for Assisted Proximate Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991504/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Practical Limitations of Network Coding for Assisted Proximate Communication","volume":"33","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14981340","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991504/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"GETA"},{"fundingName":"TISE"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingName":"Tekes"},{"fundingName":"Internet of Things Program of DIGILE"},{"fundingName":"the Academy of Finland under a Postdoctoral Researcher Grant"},{"fundingName":"Nokia Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Practical Limitations of Network Coding for Assisted Proximate Communication","sourcePdf":"jsac-pyattaev-2384232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150504S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7055202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7055202","articleId":"6991504","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6991511,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadhossein Alvandi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7055202/6991511/alvan-2384331-small.gif","p":["\nMohammadhossein Alvandi (S'10) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from \nthe Amir Kabir University, Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Concordia \nUniversity, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2014, all in electrical and computer engineering.

However, previous work emphasized maximization of network throughput without considering quality of service (QoS) requirements, which may lead to high packet delays in the network. The objective of this work is minimization of packet delay in a TDMA-based MWN that is jointly utilizing NC and SIC techniques for a given traffic demand matrix. We assume conflict-free scheduling and allow multipath routing. We formulate a cross-layer optimization that assigns time slots to links in a way that the average packet delay is minimized. The problem formulation results in a difficult mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that the state-of-art software can only solve for very small-sized networks. For large networks, we develop a heuristic approach that iteratively determines the optimal solution. We present numerical results, which show that the average packet delay and traffic handling capacity of a network, using w/o NC+SIC, NC, SIC and NC+SIC schemes, improves from left to right. The traffic capacity of NC+SIC is double of the w/o NC+SIC. Thus, combined utilization of NC and SIC techniques results in significant performance improvement.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055202","startPage":"295","endPage":"308","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7055202/06991511.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Optimization and Cross-Layer Design in Multihop Wireless Networks With Network Coding and Successive Interference Cancelation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6991511/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Delay Optimization and Cross-Layer Design in Multihop Wireless Networks With Network Coding and Successive Interference Cancelation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14981350","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Optimization and Cross-Layer Design in Multihop Wireless Networks With Network Coding and Successive Interference Cancelation","sourcePdf":"jsac-alvandi-2384331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147762S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7055202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7055202","articleId":"6991511","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6991512,"authors":[{"name":"Lizhao You","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7055202/6991512/you-2384297-small.gif","p":["\nLizhao You (S'13) received the B.S. and M.E. degrees from Nanjing \nUniversity, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2013, respectively.

NCMA is a new design paradigm for multipacket reception wireless networks, in which the access point can receive and decode several packets simultaneously transmitted by multiple users. Conventionally, multipacket reception is realized using MUD only, whereas the key idea of NCMA is to use PNC together with MUD to realize multipacket reception. Although the feasibility of NCMA has previously been studied by the authors, our previous NCMA prototype was a version with offline signal processing. In addition, our previous investigation left open a number of theoretical and implementation issues, the resolution of which is critical to the adoption of NCMA in real practice. The current investigation makes the following state-of-the-art contributions toward NCMA: 1) we demonstrate a first NCMA system with integrated real-time PHY and MAC-layer decoding; 2) we construct a new unified framework for MAC-layer decoding that yields higher throughput with faster decoding-the faster decoding is one of the key enablers of our real-time implementation; and 3) we design new PHY-layer decoding techniques that overcome the poor performance of the first-generation NCMA prototype at low SNR. Experimental results show that, compared with the previous NCMA prototype, our new NCMA prototype improves real-time throughput by more than 100% at medium-high SNR (\u2265 8 dB).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Equations","Multiuser detection","Mathematical model","Real-time systems","Throughput","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","multi-access systems","network coding","signal processing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-coded multiple access system","NCMA system","physical-layer network coding","PHY-PNC","multiuser decoding","MUD","wireless local area network","WLAN","multipacket reception wireless networks","packet decoding","offline signal processing","MAC-layer decoding","integrated real-time PHY decoding techniques","low SNR","signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network coding","physical-layer network coding","multi-user detection","multiple access","network-coded multiple access","implementation"]},{"kwd":["Network coding","physical-layer network coding","multiuser detection","multiple access","network-coded multiple access","implementation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7055202/06991512.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Coded Multiple Access II: Toward Real-Time Operation With Improved Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network-Coded Multiple Access II: Toward Real-Time Operation With Improved Performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991512/","volume":"33","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991512/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14981353","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"AoE","grantNumber":"E-02/08"},{"fundingName":"General Research Funds","grantNumber":"414812"},{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61271277"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Coded Multiple Access II: Toward Real-Time Operation With Improved Performance","sourcePdf":"jsac-lu-2384297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095915S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7055202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7055202","articleId":"6991512","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6991517,"authors":[{"name":"Ping-Chung Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A\u2013M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7055202/6991517/wang-2384332-small.gif","p":["\nPing-Chung Wang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering \nfrom National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree in communication engineering from National \nTaiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

Examples of such situations include point-to-point communication over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and asynchronous wireless networks. In these scenarios, although the receiver may know all the delays, it is often not an easy task for the receiver to compensate the delays as the signals are mixed together. A novel framework, which is called interleave/deinterleave transform (IDT), is proposed to deal with this problem. It is shown that the IDT allows one to design the delays so that quasi-cyclic (QC) codes with a proper shifting constraint can be used accordingly. When used in conjunction with QC codes, IDT provides significantly better performance than existing schemes relying solely on cyclic codes. Two instances of asynchronous physical-layer network coding, namely, the integer-forcing equalization for ISI channels and asynchronous compute-and-forward, are then studied. For integer-forcing equalization, the proposed scheme provides improved performance over using cyclic codes. For asynchronous compute-and-forward, the proposed scheme shows that there is no loss in the achievable information rates due to delays that are integer multiples of the symbol duration. Furthermore, the proposed approach shows that delays introduced by the channel can sometimes be exploited to obtain higher information rates than those obtainable in the synchronous case. The proposed IDT can be thought of as a generalization of the interleaving/deinterleaving idea proposed by Wang et al., which allows the use of QC codes, thereby substantially increasing the design space.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7055202/06991517.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Physical-Layer Network Coding With Quasi-Cyclic Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Physical-Layer Network Coding With Quasi-Cyclic Codes","volume":"33","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991517/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14981355","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991517/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CIF 1302616"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Physical-Layer Network Coding With Quasi-Cyclic Codes","sourcePdf":"jsac-wang-2384332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096561S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7055202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7055202","articleId":"6991517","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6991519,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7055202/6991519/wang-2384352-small.gif","p":["\nRui Wang (M'14) received the B.S. degree from Anhui Normal University, \nWuhu, China, in 2006, the M.S. degree from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from \nShanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, in 2013, all in electronic engineering.

Each user is equipped with M antennas, and the relay is equipped with N antennas. The degrees of freedom (DoF) of the MIMO mRC has recently attracted much research interest. The DoF results under certain configurations of (L,K,M,N) have been reported. However, the DoF capacity of the MIMO mRC with an arbitrary network configuration is, in general, far from being well understood. In this regard, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a systematic signal alignment approach to jointly design the beamforming matrices at the users and the relay. Based on that, an achievable DoF is derived for the MIMO mRC with an arbitrary network configuration of (L,K,M,N). Our analysis revealed that the derived achievable DoF is piecewise linear in M and N alternately. Moreover, we showed that the DoF capacity can be achieved for M/N \u2208 [1/LK(K-1) + 1/2, \u221e) and M/N \u2208 (0, Lq/LK(Lq-1)], where q = 2 \u2308K/2\u2309.We further derived the asymptotic DoF as K or L \u2192 \u221e. The DoF analysis in this paper can provide insights on the practical design of efficient communication mechanisms over multiterminal MIMO relay networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Multiway Relay Channel With Clustered Pairwise Exchange","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7055202/06991519.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Multiway Relay Channel With Clustered Pairwise Exchange","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6991519/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14981342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401313"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471241"},{"fundingName":"General Research Funds","grantNumber":"418712"},{"fundingName":"University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China"},{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61322102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Multiway Relay Channel With Clustered Pairwise Exchange","sourcePdf":"jsac-wang-2384352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121533S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7055202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7055202","articleId":"6991519","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6991523,"authors":[{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7055202/6991523/peng-2384298-small.gif","p":["\nMugen Peng (M'05\u2013SM'11) received the Ph.D. degree in communication \nand information system from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2005.

As one of the most promising and efficient user cooperation techniques, network coding can increase the potential cooperation performance gains among selfishly driven users in MSNs. To take full advantages of network coding in MH-WCNs, a network coding transmission strategy and its corresponding channel estimation technique are studied in this paper. Particularly, a four-hop network coding transmission is presented first, followed by an extension strategy for the arbitrary 2N-hop scenario (N \u2265 2). The linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation methods are designed to improve the transmission quality in MH-WCNs. Closed-form expressions in terms of the mean square error (MSE) for the LMMSE channel estimation method are derived, which allows the design of the optimal training sequence. Unlike the LMMSE method, it is difficult to obtain closed-form MSE expressions for the nonlinear ML channel estimation method. In order to accomplish optimal training sequence design for the ML method, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound is employed. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the proposed analysis, and the results demonstrate that the analysis is accurate and the proposed methods are effective.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7055202/06991523.pdf","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coded Multihop Wireless Communication Networks: Channel Estimation and Training Design","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384298","startPage":"281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Network Coded Multihop Wireless Communication Networks: Channel Estimation and Training Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991523/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","accessionNumber":"14981351","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6991523/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222103"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"Chinese State Major Science and Technology Special Project","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001001"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1343210"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Coded Multihop Wireless Communication Networks: Channel Estimation and Training Design","sourcePdf":"jsac-peng-2384298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098582S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7055202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7055202","articleId":"6991523","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6991526,"authors":[{"name":"Kee-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kee-Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37599499300"},{"name":"Hosung Park","affiliation":["California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hosung","lastName":"Park","id":"37896589500"},{"name":"Jong-Seon No","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Seon","lastName":"No","id":"37085529572"},{"name":"Habong Chung","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Hong-Ik University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Habong","lastName":"Chung","id":"37085540628"},{"name":"Dong-Joon Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Joon","lastName":"Shin","id":"37085364157"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"6991526","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":739},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Vectors","Reliability","Peak to average power ratio","Receivers","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clipping noise cancellation scheme","OFDM systems","compressed sensing technique","CS technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","data tones","channel noise minimization","time domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clipping noise","compressed sensing (CS)","fast Fourier transform (FFT)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)"]},{"kwd":["Clipping noise","compressed sensing (CS)","fast Fourier transform (FFT)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a clipping noise cancelation scheme using compressed sensing (CS) technique is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. The proposed scheme does not need reserved tones or pilot tones, which is different from the previous works using CS technique. Instead, observations of the clipping noise in data tones are exploited, which leads to no loss of data rate. Also, in contrast with the previous works, the proposed scheme selectively exploits the reliable observations of the clipping noise instead of using whole observations, which results in minimizing the bad influence of channel noise. From the selected reliable observations, the clipping noise in time domain is reconstructed and canceled by using CS technique. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs well compared to other conventional clipping noise cancelation schemes and shows the best performance in some cases.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2014.2374222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7050389/06991526.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2014.2374222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7050389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clipping Noise Cancelation for OFDM Systems Using Reliable Observations Based on Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991526/","displayDocTitle":"Clipping Noise Cancelation for OFDM Systems Using Reliable Observations Based on Compressed Sensing","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14964473","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991526/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clipping Noise Cancelation for OFDM Systems Using Reliable Observations Based on Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tbc-kim-2374222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124524S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7050389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7050389","articleId":"6991526","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6991534,"authors":[{"name":"Jinchi Han","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Power Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6991534/han-2383992-small.gif","p":["\nJinchi Han (S'12) was born in Liaoyang, China, in 1990.

However, the power supply for sensor nodes (especially those installed on high-voltage side) remains one of the most challenging issues. To date, miniaturized, reliable, low-cost and flexible designs catering the massive application of self-powered sensor nodes in the smart grid are still limited. This paper presents a nonintrusive design of power supply to support the sensor network applied in the smart grid. Using a cantilever-structured magnetoelectric (ME) composite, the energy harvester is able to scavenge energy from the power-frequency (50 Hz) magnetic field distributed around the transmission line. Design considerations for this specific type of scavenger have been discussed, and optimized energy harvester prototypes have been fabricated, which are further tested on a power line platform. Experimental results show that the single-cell and double-cell energy harvesters are capable of producing 0.62 mW and 1.12 mW at 10 A, respectively, while corresponding power outputs are enhanced to 4.11 mW and 9.40 mW at 40 A. The good energy harvesting ability of this particular ME composite indicates its great potential to make a nonintrusive, miniaturized, flexible and cost-effective power supply, which possesses great application prospects in the smart grid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15142391","htmlLink":"/document/6991534/","displayDocTitle":"A Nonintrusive Power Supply Design for Self-Powered Sensor Networks in the Smart Grid by Scavenging Energy From AC Power Line","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51429701"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB228206"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonintrusive Power Supply Design for Self-Powered Sensor Networks in the Smart Grid by Scavenging Energy From AC Power Line","sourcePdf":"tie-han-2383992-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102819S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7109198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7109198","articleId":"6991534","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6991536,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel R.

The sampled fields in the planar aperture have to comply the Nyquist theorem. The method takes into account the amplitude of the unit cell radiation pattern, which allows to compute more accurately the copolar and crosspolar components of the far field. Due to the generality of the NUFFT, it also allows to overcome some limitations of the FFT when computing the radiated fields of reflectarrays with periodicity larger than half a wavelength. Because the NUFFT is precision-dependent, a discussion of how its accuracy can affect the computed radiated fields is carried out. Numerical examples are provided to show the accuracy and performance of the NUFFT with regard to the FFT and direct evaluation of the fields. Finally, a study of computing times comparing the FFT, NUFFT and direct evaluation is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6991536/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914952","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Calculation of the Far Field Radiated by Non-Uniformly Sampled Planar Fields Complying Nyquist Theorem","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000844","fundingName":"European Space Agency"},{"fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain"},{"fundingName":"Gobierno del Principado de Asturias","grantNumber":"BP12-063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Calculation of the Far Field Radiated by Non-Uniformly Sampled Planar Fields Complying Nyquist Theorem","sourcePdf":"tap-rodriguezprado-2384033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047012S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6991536","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6991537,"authors":[{"name":"Junwei Han","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7032018/6991537/han-2374218-small.gif","p":["\n\nJunwei Han received the Ph.D. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical \nUniversity, Xi'an, China, in 2003.","He is currently a Professor with Northwestern Polytechnical University.

In this paper, a novel and effective geospatial object detection framework is proposed by combining the weakly supervised learning (WSL) and high-level feature learning. First, deep Boltzmann machine is adopted to infer the spatial and structural information encoded in the low-level and middle-level features to effectively describe objects in optical RSIs. Then, a novel WSL approach is presented to object detection where the training sets require only binary labels indicating whether an image contains the target object or not. Based on the learnt high-level features, it jointly integrates saliency, intraclass compactness, and interclass separability in a Bayesian framework to initialize a set of training examples from weakly labeled images and start iterative learning of the object detector. A novel evaluation criterion is also developed to detect model drift and cease the iterative learning. Comprehensive experiments on three optical RSI data sets have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed approach in benchmarking with several state-of-the-art supervised-learning-based object detection approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2374218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7032018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2374218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7032018/06991537.pdf","startPage":"3325","endPage":"3337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images Based on Weakly Supervised Learning and High-Level Feature Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images Based on Weakly Supervised Learning and High-Level Feature Learning","volume":"53","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991537/","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"14914416","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991537/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91120005, 61473231 and 61401357"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images Based on Weakly Supervised Learning and High-Level Feature Learning","sourcePdf":"tgrs-han-2374218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113283S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7032018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"484","xplore-issue":"7032018","articleId":"6991537","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6991539,"authors":[{"name":"Ayad F.

Customers can rent the CSPs storage infrastructure to store and retrieve almost unlimited amount of data by paying fees metered in gigabyte/month. For an increased level of scalability, availability, and durability, some customers may want their data to be replicated on multiple servers across multiple data centers. The more copies the CSP is asked to store, the more fees the customers are charged. Therefore, customers need to have a strong guarantee that the CSP is storing all data copies that are agreed upon in the service contract, and all these copies are consistent with the most recent modifications issued by the customers. In this paper, we propose a map-based provable multicopy dynamic data possession (MB-PMDDP) scheme that has the following features: 1) it provides an evidence to the customers that the CSP is not cheating by storing fewer copies; 2) it supports outsourcing of dynamic data, i.e., it supports block-level operations, such as block modification, insertion, deletion, and append; and 3) it allows authorized users to seamlessly access the file copies stored by the CSP. We give a comparative analysis of the proposed MB-PMDDP scheme with a reference model obtained by extending existing provable possession of dynamic single-copy schemes. The theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results on a commercial cloud platform. In addition, we show the security against colluding servers, and discuss how to identify corrupted copies by slightly modifying the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provable Multicopy Dynamic Data Possession in Cloud Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2384391","startPage":"485","endPage":"497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2384391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7019030/06991539.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Provable Multicopy Dynamic Data Possession in Cloud Computing Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6991539/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14866691","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provable Multicopy Dynamic Data Possession in Cloud Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"tifs-barsoum-2384391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101702S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7019030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7019030","articleId":"6991539","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6991543,"authors":[{"name":"Kapil Kesarwani","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7219485/6991543/kesar-2384131-small.gif","p":["Kapil Kesarwani (M\u201911) received the bachelor's and\n master's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India, in 2007.","He worked as a Design Engineer from 2007 to 2011 at Cosmic Circuits, Inc., and Solar Semiconductor, Inc.

Resonant switched-capacitor (ReSC) converters show similar promise as they benefit from many of the same architectures and scaling trends, but also from ongoing improvements in mm-scale magnetic devices. In this study, we explore the design and optimization of 2:1 step-down topologies, based on representative capacitor technologies, CMOS device parameters, and air-core inductor models.

A detailed analysis of the bit-cell suggests that the S-MLC is promising for applications requiring both high density and low write-error rate, and P-MLC is particularly suitable for high-density and low-write-energy applications. We also performed iso-bit-cell area comparison of our MLC designs with previously proposed MLCs that are based on spin-transfer torque MRAM and show 3-16\u00d7 improvement in write energy.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2014.2377721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7015642/06991544.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7015642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2014.2377721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel Spin-Orbit Torque MRAMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991544","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/16/7015642/6991544-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Spin-Orbit Torque MRAMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991544/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14866608","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991544/","volume":"62","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation Program through the Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"},{"fundingName":"Center for Spintronic Materials, Interface, and Architecture, one of six centers of Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Multilevel Spin-Orbit Torque MRAMs","sourcePdf":"ted-kim-2377721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101698S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7015642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7015642","articleId":"6991544","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6991554,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelmohsen Ali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6991554/ali-2384024-small.gif","p":["\nAbdelmohsen Ali was born in Giza, Egypt, in 1982.

The proposed technique reduces the frequency with which spectrum sensing must be performed and greatly decreases the elapsed time between the start of a primary transmission and its detection by the secondary network. This is done by sensing the change in signal strength over a number of reserved OFDM sub-carriers so that the reappearance of the primary user is quickly detected. Moreover, the OFDM impairments such as power leakage, Narrow Band Interference (NBI), and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) are investigated and their impact on the proposed technique is studied. Both analysis and simulation show that the energy ratio algorithm can effectively and accurately detect the appearance of the primary user. Furthermore, our method achieves high immunity to frequency-selective fading channels for both single and multiple receive antenna systems, with a complexity that is approximately twice that of a conventional energy detector.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06991554.pdf","startPage":"2257","endPage":"2268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2384024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2384024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Monitoring Using Energy Ratio Algorithm for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Monitoring","Sensors","Receivers","Synchronization","Wireless communication","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy ratio algorithm","OFDM based cognitive radio networks","spectrum monitoring algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","secondary user transmission","spectrum sensing","primary transmission","secondary network","signal strength","OFDM subcarriers","OFDM impairments","power leakage","narrow band interference","NBI","intercarrier interference","ICI","frequency selective fading channels","receive antenna systems","conventional energy detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive networks","cognitive radio","fading channels","OFDM","spectrum sensing/monitoring"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive networks","cognitive radio","fading channels","OFDM","spectrum sensing/monitoring"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Monitoring Using Energy Ratio Algorithm for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6991554/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039154","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","grantNumber":"N008861 and N01268"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Monitoring Using Energy Ratio Algorithm for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-hamouda-2384024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099176S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6991554","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6991560,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic DiTomaso","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH, 45701"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7323921/6991560/ditom-small.gif","p":["Dominic DiTomaso received the BS and MS degrees in electrical\n engineering and computer science from Ohio University, Athens, in 2010 and 2012.

The Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm is fast becoming the standard communication infrastructure to provide scalable inter-core communication. However, research has shown that metallic interconnects cause high latency and consume excess energy in NoC architectures. Emerging technologies such as on-chip wireless interconnects can alleviate the power and bandwidth problems of traditional metallic NoCs. In this paper, we propose A-WiNoC, a scalable, adaptable wireless Network-on-Chip architecture that uses energy efficient wireless transceivers and improves network throughput by dynamically re-assigning channels in response to bandwidth demands from different cores. To implement such adaptability in our network at run-time, we propose an adaptable algorithm that works in the background along with a token sharing scheme to fully utilize the wireless bandwidth efficiently. Since no wireless NoC design has been completely realized with current technology, we describe technology trends in designing energy-efficient wireless transceivers with emerging technologies. We compare our proposed A-WiNoC to both wireless and wired topologies at 64 cores, with results showing a 1.4-2.6\u00d7 speedup on real applications and a 54 percent improvement in throughput for synthetic traffic. Using Synopsys Design Compiler, our results indicate that A-WiNoC saves 25-35 percent energy over other state-of-the-art networks. We show that A-WiNoC can scale to 256 cores with an energy improvement of 21 percent and a saturation throughput increase of approximately 37 percent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A-WiNoC: Adaptive Wireless Network-on-Chip Architecture for Chip Multiprocessors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2383384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7323921/06991560.pdf","startPage":"3289","endPage":"3302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2383384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991560/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"A-WiNoC: Adaptive Wireless Network-on-Chip Architecture for Chip Multiprocessors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6991560/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587649","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1129010, ECCS-1342657, CCF-1054339 and CNS-1342984"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A-WiNoC: Adaptive Wireless Network-on-Chip Architecture for Chip Multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"tpds-kodi-2383384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160661S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7323921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7323921","articleId":"6991560","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6991563,"authors":[{"name":"Hau Wah Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Hau Wah","lastName":"Lai","id":"37277083600"},{"name":"Hang Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Wong","id":"37280423700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6991563","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4461},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Bandwidth","Frequency measurement","Magnetoelectric effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna radiation patterns","dipole antennas","magnetic devices","magnetoelectric effects","microwave antennas","printed circuits","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["substrate integrated magnetoelectric dipole antenna","5G Wi-Fi","tapered H-shaped ground","ME dipole antenna","multilayer printed circuit board technology","PCB technology","antenna radiation pattern","polarization radiation","frequency 4.98 GHz to 6.01 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magneto-electric dipole","low profile","low back radiation","low cross polarization","5G Wi-Fi"]}],"abstract":"In this communication, a new technique-tapered H-shaped ground, is proposed to reduce the thickness of a magneto-electric (ME) dipole antenna.

imaging. In neighboring pixelated detectors with individual readout, sensitivity decreases because of multiple coincidences produced by Compton scattering. Correct analysis of those coincidences would enable a substantial sensitivity increase. However, including scattering byproducts in the image often lead to image quality degradation because of inaccurate Line-of-Response (LOR) assessment. In such scanners, to support high count rates, multiple coincidences are usually discarded when image degradation is not acceptable, or blindly accepted for a low computational burden. This paper presents a new, real-time capable method that includes Inter-Crystal Scatter (ICS) triple coincidences in the image without significant quality degradation. The method computes the LOR using a neural network fed by preprocessed raw data. As a proof of principle, this paper analyzes the simplest ICS scenario, triple coincidences where one photoelectric 511-keV event coincides with two more whose energy sum is also 511 keV. The paper visits the algorithm structure, presents Monte Carlo assessment with the LabPET model, and displays images reconstructed from real data. With an energy window of 360-660 keV and a singles energy threshold of 125 keV, the inclusion of triple coincidences yielded a sensitivity increase of 54%, a resolution degradation similar to that of other sensitivity-increasing methods, and only a slight contrast degradation for real LabPET data, with potential for numerous further improvements.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2014.2372788","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7035158/06991572.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"94","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2014.2372788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7035158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Increase Through a Neural Network Method for LOR Recovery of ICS Triple Coincidences in High-Resolution Pixelated- Detectors PET Scanners","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Increase Through a Neural Network Method for LOR Recovery of ICS Triple Coincidences in High-Resolution Pixelated- Detectors PET Scanners","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14903453","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6991572/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Increase Through a Neural Network Method for LOR Recovery of ICS Triple Coincidences in High-Resolution Pixelated- Detectors PET Scanners","sourcePdf":"tns-michaud-2372788-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128283S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7035158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7035158","articleId":"6991572","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":6991579,"authors":[{"name":"Weihan Li","affiliation":["Mechanical and Automotive Engineering Department, University of Michigan, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6991579/wli-2384003-small.gif","p":["\nWeihan Li (S'13) received the B.S. degree in automotive \nengineering from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. \ndegree in automotive engineering.","From September 2012 to August 2014, he was a joint Ph.D. student funded by the China Scholarship Council with the \nGraduate Automotive Technology Education Center for Electric Drive Transportation, Department of Electrical and \nComputer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, MI, USA, where he was involved in the modeling and design of a \nwireless charger for electric vehicles (EVs)/plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

In this paper, we consider the design of an uplink distributed MIMO system where 1) the channel state information is not available at the transmitters and 2) the BH links are rate constrained. We propose a new linear network coding (LNC)-based protocol: the M users transmit simultaneously. Each BS generates N linear functions of the M users' messages, based on a preassigned LNC coefficient matrix. The CU collects N \u00b7 L linear functions from the L BSs and recovers all M users' messages by solving these linear functions. The decoding becomes successful if the linear functions has full rank M and fails if the linear functions are rank deficient. We derive the preassigned LNC coefficient matrix that minimizes the probability of rank deficiency. We then analyze the outage probability (OP) of the proposed scheme over a Rayleigh fading channel. We analytically show that as long as the BH rate is greater than the individual data rate of one user, the OP of the proposed scheme decays like 1/SNR\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</sup>\n at high SNR. This is in contrast to the existing scheme whose OP decays like 1/SNR.

The considered setup consists of a base station, several users, and a single eavesdropper that intends to wiretap the transmitted message within each OFDMA subchannel. By taking into consideration the existence of the eavesdropper, the base station aims to assign subchannels and allocate the available power in order to optimize the max-min fairness criterion over the users' secrecy rate. The considered problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program. For a fixed subchannel assignment, the optimal power allocation is obtained by developing an algorithm of polynomial computational complexity. In the general case, the problem is investigated from two different perspectives due to its combinatorial nature. In the first, the number of users is equal or higher than the number of subchannels, whereas in the second, the number of users is less than the number of subchannels. In the first case, we provide the optimal solution in polynomial time by transforming the original problem into an assignment one for which there are polynomial time algorithms. In the second case, the secrecy rate formula is linearly approximated and the problem is transformed to a mixed integer linear program, which is solved by a branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, optimality is discussed for two particular cases where the available power tends to infinity and zero, respectively. Based on the resulting insights, three heuristic schemes of polynomial complexity are proposed, offering a better balance between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that each one of these schemes achieves its highest performance at a different power regime of the system.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2384392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7019030/06991587.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2384392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security-Aware Max\u2013Min Resource Allocation in Multiuser OFDMA Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6991587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Security-Aware Max\u2013Min Resource Allocation in Multiuser OFDMA Downlink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991587/","publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14901349","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991587/","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU and national funds via the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)\u2013Research Funding Program \u201cThales\u201d (project ENDECON)"},{"fundingName":"Research Promotion Foundation, Cyprus","grantNumber":"KOYLTOYRA/BP-NE/0613/04"},{"fundingName":"\u201cFull-Duplex Radio: Modeling, Analysis and Design (FDRD),\u201d"},{"fundingName":"University of Patras, Greece"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security-Aware Max\u2013Min Resource Allocation in Multiuser OFDMA Downlink","sourcePdf":"tifs-karachontzitis-2384392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153806S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7019030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7019030","articleId":"6991587","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6991590,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7086423/6991590/wu-2377018-small.gif","p":["Dan Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

The MARC system described above is referred to as estimates-exploiting MARC (e-MARC) in this paper for convenience. Following the probability derivation of e-MARC, comparisons are then made with the outage probability of the orthogonal MARC with the Select Decode-and-Forward relaying strategy (MARC-SDF). It is found through simulations that when one of the source nodes is far away from both the relay and the destination, the e-MARC system is superior to MARC-SDF in terms of outage performance. We further numerically calculate the outage probabilities for two special cases, and compare them with the probability of e-MARC. Furthermore, the impact of the source correlation on the outage probability of the e-MARC system is also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2384046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06991591.pdf","startPage":"2269","endPage":"2280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2384046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probabilities of Orthogonal Multiple-Access Relaying Techniques With Imperfect Source-Relay Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probabilities of Orthogonal Multiple-Access Relaying Techniques With Imperfect Source-Relay Links","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6991591/","accessionNumber":"15039125","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union's FP7 project, ICT-619555 RESCUE (Links-on-the-fly Technology for Robust"},{"fundingName":"Efficient and Smart Communication in Unpredictable Environments)"},{"fundingName":"Japanese government funding program","grantNumber":"23360170"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probabilities of Orthogonal Multiple-Access Relaying Techniques With Imperfect Source-Relay Links","sourcePdf":"twc-lu-2384046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093273S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6991591","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6991609,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Navid","affiliation":["Rambus Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7066864/6991609/6991609-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Navid (S'00\u2013M'05\u2013SM'11) received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1996, the M.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 2005, all in electrical engineering.","His interests include technology development for wireline communication systems and associated mixed-signal circuits.

Transmit equalization consists of a 2-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) while receive equalization includes a 2-tap FFE using a transversal filter, a 3-stage continuous-time linear equalizer with active feedback, and discrete-time equalizers consisting of a 17-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a 3-tap sampled FFE. The receiver uses quarter-rate double integrate-and-hold sampling. The clock and data recovery (CDR) unit uses a split-path CDR/DFE design which facilitates wider bandwidth and lower jitter simultaneously. A phase detection scheme that filters out edges affected by residual inter-symbol interference allows recovering a low-jitter clock from a partially-equalized eye. A fractional-N PLL is implemented for frequency offset tracking. Combining these techniques, the digital CDR recovers a stable 10 GHz clock from an eye containing 0.8 UI p-p input jitter and achieves 1-10 MHz of tracking bandwidth.

We address the challenge of signal generation above the cut-off frequency of transistors by presenting a radiation method based on the collective performance of a large number of synchronized sources. As theory shows, both frequency locking/tuning and beam steering can be independently achieved by manipulating the local coupling between the nearest neighbors. This control method results in a dynamical network that is insensitive to array dimensions and is scalable to the point that can achieve a level of output power and spectral purity beyond the reach of conventional sources. To demonstrate the concept, we implement a 4 \u00d74 version of this phased array at 340 GHz using a 65 nm bulk CMOS process. The paper presents the design and implementation of the oscillators, couplings and the integrated antennas. The measured results at 338 GHz reveal a peak equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of +17.1 dBm and a phase noise of -93 dBc/Hz at the 1 MHz offset frequency. This chip presents the first fully integrated terahertz phased array on silicon. Furthermore, the output power is higher than any lens-less silicon-based source above 200 GHz and the phase noise is lower than all silicon radiating sources above 100 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","volume":"50","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14883111","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6991611/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A High-Power and Scalable 2-D Phased Array for Terahertz CMOS Integrated Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Power and Scalable 2-D Phased Array for Terahertz CMOS Integrated Systems","sourcePdf":"jssc-tousi-2375324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08097S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7024661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7024661","articleId":"6991611","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6991615,"authors":[{"name":"Akshay Kumar","affiliation":["Hume Center for National Security and Technology and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6991615/kumar-2384013-small.gif","p":["\n\nAkshay Kumar (S'13) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA, in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","He was an intern with the Small Cells Group, Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, where he worked on mitigating radio-frequency coexistence issues in small-cell eNodeBs.

However, in this case, incorrect sensing decisions and resource allocation on the unlicensed secondary users' (SU) part can lead to undesired degradation of the primary users' performance. Therefore, there has been a recent paradigm shift to enable cooperative spectrum sharing, in which interaction is allowed between the primary and the secondary network for efficient spectrum utilization while limiting the interference experienced by a primary user. In this paper, we consider a cooperative spectrum sharing architecture in which the SU is assumed to be a cellular network. We then propose a novel fractional-frequency-reuse-based dynamic resource allocation (DRA) algorithm at the secondary (cellular) network. The joint DRA optimization involves simultaneous spectrum allocation across different base stations and then across users within a base station. It is an NP-hard problem and is prohibitively complex to solve for a large cellular network. Therefore, to reduce the complexity of the joint problem and offer a tractable solution, we formulate layered scheduling algorithms for cross-layer resource allocation. Furthermore, the feedback overhead between the layers is kept minimal. Finally, using simulations, we compare our proposed DRA scheme with other resource allocation schemes for sum system throughput, as well as for fairness in allocation. We also present the result for the case when the available primary spectrum varies over time and locations of SUs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06991615.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2384013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2384013","startPage":"5232","endPage":"5245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cooperative Spectrum Sharing in LTE Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6991615/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cooperative Spectrum Sharing in LTE Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6991615/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15587065","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cooperative Spectrum Sharing in LTE Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-kumar-2384013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101363S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6991615","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6991724,"authors":[{"name":"Wendan Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power System Intelligent Dispatch and Control of Ministry of Education, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China"],"bio":{"p":["Wendan Li was born in 1990.

Based on both reactive power management and real power curtailment of inverters, this study proposes a comprehensive PV control strategy to improve the performance of unbalanced three-phase four-wire low voltage (LV) distribution networks with high PV penetrations. The optimal combination of PV set points is determined by solving a multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) problem that can simultaneously improve voltage magnitude and balance profiles while minimizing network loss, inverter loss associated with reactive power generation and the cost of real power generation curtailment. To reflect preferences on control objectives, the multi-objective problem is reformulated into an aggregated single-objective problem using weighted sum method and then solved by the global particle swarm optimization (PSO) in MATLAB. Detailed simulations are performed and analysed for a typical scenario of high PV penetration on a real three-phase four-wire unbalanced distribution network in Perth Solar City trial, Australia.","doi":"10.1109/CICED.2014.6992001","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974757/6991649/06992001.pdf","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1748","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 China International Conference on Electricity Distribution (CICED)","publicationTitle":"2014 China International Conference on Electricity Distribution (CICED)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICED.2014.6992001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6991649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSO based multi-objective optimization of unbalanced lv distribution network by PV inverter control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"PSO based multi-objective optimization of unbalanced lv distribution network by PV inverter control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14825515","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992001/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSO based multi-objective optimization of unbalanced lv distribution network by PV inverter control","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"FP0738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05741S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974757","isNumber":"6991649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974757","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6991649","articleId":"6992001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6992004,"authors":[{"name":"Jhin-Fang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhin-Fang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281261900"},{"name":"Jiun-Yu Wen","affiliation":["National Communications Commission"],"firstName":"Jiun-Yu","lastName":"Wen","id":"37597606000"},{"name":"Yen-Jung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Jung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085463046"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992004","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","elliptic filters","ladder filters","low-pass filters","switched capacitor filters","VHF filters","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage supply","power consumption","stop band attenuation","SFDR","spurious free dynamic range","cutoff frequency","sampling rate","WCDMA","WiMAX","WiFi","TSMC CMOS process","SFC","5th-order elliptic low pass ladder filter","bilinear transformation","switched capacitor low-pass filter","frequency 10 MHz","size 0.18 mum","power 18 mW","voltage 10 V","frequency 80 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["switched capacitor filter","SCF","ladder filter","opamp"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992004","abstract":"By using bilinear transformation to a 5\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n-order elliptic low pass ladder filter, a 10 MHz switched capacitor filter (SFC) is presented.

In this paper, an Finite impulse response (FIR) precoder which supports multiple streams at the transmitter and an FIR minimum mean-squared-error decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) at the receiver are jointly designed for broadband multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multicast systems. At the base station (transmitter), the FIR precoder design is combined by an FIR matrix multiplied by a unitary one, where the first one is optimized to maximize the system throughput, and the second one is aiming for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fairness among different data streams. Moreover, a Givens-based algorithm is employed to construct the unitary matrix in the multicast system. For each user (receiver), the corresponding FIR MMSE-DFE is derived to eliminate inter-symbol interference (ISI) introduced by both the multicast channel and the FIR filter used at the transmitter. The numerical simulations indicate that the proposed transceiver design with FIR structure has considerable improvement over the existing schemes in terms of BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992008","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992008.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIR transceiver design for broadband MIMO multicast system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FIR transceiver design for broadband MIMO multicast system","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992008/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824903","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992008/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FIR transceiver design for broadband MIMO multicast system","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569972435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055879S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6992009,"authors":[{"name":"Zilong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37061621200"},{"name":"Xiaodong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37653889600"},{"name":"Baisheng Du","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Baisheng","lastName":"Du","id":"38518236000"},{"name":"Jiaqi Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085577107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992009","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Vectors","Multicast communication","Iterative methods","Algorithm design and analysis","MIMO","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","codecs","concave programming","data communication","iterative methods","multicast communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lozano method","SNR vectors","nonconvex optimization problem","signal-to-noise ratio","multioutput multicasting channel","successive interference cancelation receivers","data streams","physical layer multicasting","SIC receivers","TIMO multicasting","unitary precoder design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer multicasting","TIMO channel","unitary precoder","ZF-SIC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992009","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992009.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel unitary precoder design for TIMO multicasting with SIC receivers","abstract":"Physical layer multicasting attracts tremendous research interests recently.

Simulation results show the proposed Max-SINR plus Max-SLNR per user achieves appreciable sum-rate gains over existing Max-SINR plus Max-SLNR per antenna, zero-forcing and block diagonalization beamformers while the proposed Max-SR-SCP achieves substantial sum-rate gains over Min-SR-SCP and random SCP.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992011","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992011.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992011","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance beamforming and spatial channel pairing schemes at relay station for AF-based multi-pair two-way relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"High-performance beamforming and spatial channel pairing schemes at relay station for AF-based multi-pair two-way relay networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992011/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992011/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance beamforming and spatial channel pairing schemes at relay station for AF-based multi-pair two-way relay networks","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569976333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089184S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6992012,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085545677"},{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China","College of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"38576289700"},{"name":"Jiankang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiankang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992012","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992012","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data integration","Vectors","Bit error rate","Optical wavelength conversion","Computational modeling","Uplink","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","cooperative communication","differential equations","nonlinear programming","optical fibre communication","sensor fusion","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential evolution algorithm","pilot aided weighted data fusion scheme","uplink base-station cooperation system","inter-cell interference","ICI","high-speed optical fiber backhaul","diversity gain","pilot symbol assisted data fusion scheme","suboptimal weight calculation model","nonlinear programming problem","suboptimal model","differential evolution algorithmcooperative information","computational complexity","backhaul traffic","performance analysis","performance simulation"]}],"abstract":"Base Station Cooperation (BSC), has been a promising technique for combating the Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) by exchanging information through a high-speed optical fiber back-haul to increase the diversity gain. In this paper, we propose a novel pilot symbol assisted data fusion scheme for Uplink BSC (UBSC). Furthermore, the proposed scheme exploits the pre-defined pilot symbols as the sample of transmitted symbols to constitute a sub-optimal Weight Calculation (WC) model. To circumvent the non-linear programming problem of the proposed sub-optimal model, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed for searching the proper fusion weights. Compared with the existing equal weights based soft combining scheme, the proposed scheme can adaptively adjust the fusion weights according to the accuracy of cooperative information, which remains the relatively low computational complexity and back-haul traffic. Performance analysis and simulation results show that, the proposed scheme can significantly improve the system performance with the pilot settings of the existing standards.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992012","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992012.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential evolution algorithm based pilot aided weighted data fusion scheme for uplink base-station cooperation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Differential evolution algorithm based pilot aided weighted data fusion scheme for uplink base-station cooperation system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992012/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824890","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential evolution algorithm based pilot aided weighted data fusion scheme for uplink base-station cooperation system","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569976841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048916S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6992015,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Zong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Zong","id":"37085494292"},{"name":"Hui Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Feng","id":"38081852200"},{"name":"Shiyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shiyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085482406"},{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291214800"},{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37275649000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992015","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":538},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Integrated circuits","Array signal processing","Vectors","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","concave programming","convex programming","energy harvesting","filtering theory","inductive power transmission","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","relaxation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SWIPT","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output interference network","MIMO interference network","transmitter","data streaming","receiver","beamforming","power splitting","PS","information decoding","ID","energy harvesting","EH","multiple receive antenna","receive filter","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraint","SINR constraint","nonconvex joint transceiver design problem","efficient alternating optimization algorithm","semidefinite relaxation","SDR","rank-one solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)","power splitting","alternating optimization","semidefinite relaxation (SDR)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference networks. In this system, each transmitter sends one data stream to its targeted receiver through beamforming, while each receiver divides the received signal into two signal flows via power splitting (PS), for information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), respectively. Different from the existing work in [1], each receiver is equipped with multiple receive antennas, and leverages a receive filter to recover information symbols. Our objective is thus to minimize the total transmit power of all transmitters by jointly designing beamformers, power splitters and receive filters, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for ID and the harvested power constraint for EH at each receiver. To solve this non-convex joint transceiver design problem, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed via iteratively solving its two convex sub-problems. We prove that the first subproblem relaxed by semidefinite relaxation (SDR) always has a rank-one solution, which indicates the relaxation is actually tight. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can save more total transmit power than the existing scheme [1], and its convergence speed is also desirable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint transceiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-user MIMO interference networks","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992015","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992015.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint transceiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-user MIMO interference networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992015/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824967","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint transceiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-user MIMO interference networks","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569980403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069975S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6992017,"authors":[{"name":"Fanxin Zeng","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab. of Emergency Communication, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Fanxin","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37279835500"},{"name":"Linjie Qian","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab. of Emergency Communication, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Linjie","lastName":"Qian","id":"37998919900"},{"name":"Zhenyu Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab. of Emergency Communication, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279625700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992017","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cascading style sheets","Standards","Phase shift keying","Correlation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Boolean functions","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","code division multiple access","Golay codes","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstandard generalized Boolean functions","16-QAM Golay-Davis-Jedwab complementary sequence construction","16-QAM GDJ CS","GBF","Chong improvement","CDMA","OFDM communication system","multiple access interference removal","MAI removal","peak-to-mean envelope power ratio reduction","PMEPR reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-standard QPSK GDJ complementary sequences","16-QAM Golay complementary sequences","generalized Boolean function","MAI","PMEPR"]}],"abstract":"The given examples show that the standard 16-QAM Golay-Davis-Jedwab (GDJ) complementary sequences (CSs) cannot be yielded whenever the non-standard generalized Boolean functions (GBFs) are fed to Chong, et al's construction.

One of the major concerns in VLC implementation is developing resource allocation schemes that maintain or increase channel throughput, ensure fairness and fast link recovery while reducing delay. To address this challenge, the characteristics of VLC channel is modeled in detail mathematically and the resource allocation problem is formulated for a centrally controlled indoor VLC system in this paper. We focus on a VLC system providing location based services and it is shown that the resource allocation problem can be solved by optimal scheduling, and the solution has to consider different transmission scenarios based on different transmitters and receivers' locations. Specifically, a scheduling algorithm using proportional fair principle is proposed and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperform the maximum rate scheduling and round robin by balancing the user throughput and fairness among users.

We first find the positions of non-zero taps in time domain and then estimate elevation angle and azimuth angle on each tap jointly. At last, attenuation factor on each tap is obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves more effective channel estimation performance compared to least square (LS) estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new sparse channel estimation for 2D MIMO-OFDM systems based on compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992042","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992042.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A new sparse channel estimation for 2D MIMO-OFDM systems based on compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992042/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824874","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new sparse channel estimation for 2D MIMO-OFDM systems based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569990361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059895S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6992043,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Luo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085350401"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"},{"name":"Hoa Le Minh","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Hoa","lastName":"Le Minh","id":"37269845400"},{"name":"Xuan Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37538371500"},{"name":"Hsin-Mu Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Mu","lastName":"Tsai","id":"38238595200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992043","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1069},"abstract":"In this paper, an optical camera communication system utilizing the under-sampled phase shift ON-OFF keying modulation is proposed to support non-flickering visible light communication.

RF power detectors and ADCs are introduced to indicate the residual self-interference power arriving at receivers. Multidimensional gradient descent search algorithm aiming at minimizing residual self-interference power is used to find out the optimal setting for the adjustable attenuation, time delay and phase shift of each tap in multi-tap cancellers. In the further digital cancellation, due to the fact that the non-linear component and noise arisen from transmitters are significant in residual self-interference and difficult to be cancelled, we use additional receivers to get the feedback of local transmitted RF signals, and therefore the non-linear component and noise hided in them are known and can easily be cancelled. The feedback makes it not necessary to estimate non-linear component and transmitter noise in digital cancellation algorithm and thus makes the algorithm simple. Actually, a simple channel estimation based method utilizing the feedback can accurately reconstruct self-interference. Then the reconstructed self-interference is subtracted from received signals to complete the digital cancellation. Our implementation can cancel the self-interference caused by 23dBm LTE transmitted signals to the receiver noise floor of -90dBm and achieve 220Mbps full duplex communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full duplex 2\u00d72 MIMO radios","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992050","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992050.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Full duplex 2\u00d72 MIMO radios","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992050/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824976","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full duplex 2\u00d72 MIMO radios","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569990947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075058S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6992056,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Qiang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

Because of the integer nature of channel, most of the current reservation schemes were based on integer. However, the number of reserved channels of integer reservation schemes can't be adequately adjusted as a result of optimizing the system performance. In this paper, we model the cognitive radio network as a two-dimensional Markov process, which overcomes the restriction of integer nature of channel. Then two fractional reservation schemes are realized. One is fractional channel reservation for primary user (FCRPU), the other is fractional channel reservation for handoff secondary user (FCRHSU), both of which can solve the trade-off problem above very well. The precision of analytical results is validated by Monte Carlo Simulations, on the strength of which we come to the conclusion that fractional channel reservation scheme and the FCRHSU scheme can achieve better performances than the integer one and the FCRPU one, respectively.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992057.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access based on fractional channel reservation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992057/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access based on fractional channel reservation","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824983","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access based on fractional channel reservation","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569991139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056255S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992060,"authors":[{"name":"Adong Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Adong","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085376265"},{"name":"Xiaowei Qin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Qin","id":"37303945100"},{"name":"Xuchu Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuchu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37279595200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992060","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel parallel breadth-first detection scheme for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems called Partial Inter-layer Parallel Sphere Decoder (PIPS-D).

Relay selection, which is studied for more than ten years, is a technique used to select one or some relays to improve system bit error rate (BER) performance. Obviously, for the relay selection (RS) based multi-relay OFDM system without using subcarriers suppression (SS) technique, the BER performance will further be improved by applying SS to it. But the subcarriers suppression is a throughput reduction technique, the throughput performance of the OFDM relaying system will be degraded when SS is applied directly. To solve this problem and further improve the BER performance, a JSSRS scheme is proposed for PLNC based Two-Way OFDM relaying system in this paper. The simulation results show that the proposed JSSRS scheme not only enhances the reliability but also can improve the efficiency of the PLNC based Two-Way OFDM relaying system under some conditions. In other words, it is shown in this paper that the proposed JSSRS scheme achieves a significant performances gain both in BER and throughput under some conditions when compared with the traditional relay selection scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992065.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint subcarriers suppression and relay selection in PLNC based Two-Way OFDM relaying system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","OFDM","Wireless communication","Silicon","Throughput","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","error statistics","network coding","OFDM modulation","protocols","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLNC","two-way OFDM relaying system","joint subcarriers suppression and relay selection","physical layer network coding","two-way orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","decode-and-forward protocol","multipath Rayleigh fading channel","bit error rate","BER performance","relay selection based multi-relay OFDM system","subcarriers suppression","reliability","relay selection scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PLNC Based OFDM Relaying System","Decode-and-Forward","Joint Subcarriers Suppression and Relay Selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint subcarriers suppression and relay selection in PLNC based Two-Way OFDM relaying system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992065/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824922","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint subcarriers suppression and relay selection in PLNC based Two-Way OFDM relaying system","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1569991637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070687S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992070,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.

However, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) may decrease in IA. Opportunistic IA (OIA) schemes can provide more opportunities for the users to access the network and improve the performance; nevertheless, the unselected users remain idle, which is a waste of resource. Thus in this paper, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in OIA networks is studied. As the unselected users in OIA networks can be treated as energy harvesting (EH) terminals, an OIA user selection (OIAUS) algorithm is proposed to optimize the SWIPT performance through user selection, according to the information-transmission (IT) and EH performance as well as the requirements of users. To further reduce the complexity, a random complexity-reduced OIAUS algorithm is designed to make a tradeoff between performance and complexity. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992071","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992071.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic interference alignment networks for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer through user selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic interference alignment networks for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer through user selection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992071/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824866","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992071/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic interference alignment networks for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer through user selection","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570000841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118323S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6992072,"authors":[{"name":"Weiliang Fan","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiliang","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085403233"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085364222"},{"name":"Zhijun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085409830"},{"name":"Xinyu Mao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Mao","id":"37895757100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992072","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Heuristic algorithms","Decoding","Bit error rate","Signal processing algorithms","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic K-best SD algorithm","MIMO detection","multiple input multiple output","MIMO system","spectral efficiency","wireless communication","detection algorithms","maximum likelihood detection","computational complexity","ML detection","K-Best SD sphere decoding","K-Best SD algorithm","partial Euclidean distance","BER performance loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)","Detection","K-Best SD Sphere Decoding (K-Best SD)"]}],"abstract":"Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system is considered as an unalterable technology in wireless communication for its advantages in the spectral efficiency. Among the detection algorithms, maximum likelihood (ML) detection can achieve the best bit error rate performance, but the computational complexity of ML detection is too huge to be acceptable. In order to solve this problem, numbers of algorithms have been proposed. The K-Best SD sphere decoding (K-Best SD) algorithm is one of them. As K increase, the K-Best SD algorithm will approach the bit error rate of ML detection. However, if the K is large, the computational complexity will be unacceptable.

After judging whether the overlap exists among these selected beams, we divide the user set into two subsets, i.e., a non-interference subset or an interference subset. The non-interference subset employs an SDMA based transmission scheme, while the interference subset employs an interference suppression based scheme. This combination takes advantages of both schemes, reduces the feedback amount in frequency division duplex transmission mode, and meanwhile ensures all the users being served on a same time-frequency resource block.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is also known as blind source separation (BSS), which depends on the independence of source signals to separate or extract latent signals of interest. In this paper, we build an analogous ICA model for OFDM systems with the CFO. By virtue of this model, the ICA technique can be utilized to compensate corresponding loss of performance due to imperfect CFO estimation in the conventional method. Theoretical analysis shows that the ICA-based carrier synchronization method not only has maximum likelihood (ML) source recovery ability, but also can improve signal to noise ratio (SNR) of OFDM systems. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992076","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992076.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent component analysis for carrier synchronization in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992076/","displayDocTitle":"Independent component analysis for carrier synchronization in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824936","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992076/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent component analysis for carrier synchronization in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570001775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089312S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6992078,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Du","affiliation":["Unit 72959 of PLA, Jinan, China","College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Du","id":"37085439670"},{"name":"Chaocan Xiang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chaocan","lastName":"Xiang","id":"38242248700"},{"name":"Daoxing Guo","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Daoxing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532174900"},{"name":"Bangning Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bangning","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37069784500"},{"name":"Hailiang Zhang","affiliation":["Unit 72959 of PLA, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Hailiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085440094"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992078","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992078","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Estimation","Resistance","Collaboration","Parameter estimation","Accuracy","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","expectation-maximisation algorithm","radio spectrum management","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["primary user","SU operating point parameters","fusion center","PU state information","estimation accuracy enhancement","incorrect sensing report elimination","random errors","reputation-based schemes","CSS performance","expectation maximization method","EM method","CRN","collaborative spectrum sensing","SSDF attack","spectrum sensing data falsification attack","imperfect reporting channels","cognitive radio networks","counteracting malicious user detection accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","collaborative spectrum sensing","expectation maximization algorithm","malicious secondary users' detection","security"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992078","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Counteracting malicious users in cognitive radio networks over imperfect reporting channels","abstract":"Spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack are serious threats to collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In this paper, inspired by EM (Expectation Maximization) method, we propose a scheme to estimate the presences of primary user (PU) and the SUs' operating point parameters (false alarm and detection probabilities) iteratively. The key features of the proposed scheme is that, by using the estimated SUs' operating point parameters, the fusion center can estimate the presences of the PU, while the PU's state information is feedback to enhance the estimation accuracy of SUs' operating point parameters. Furthermore, our scheme can achieve a powerful capability of eliminating incorrect sensing reports, which can avoid over penalize the honest users who have random errors in reporting channels. The numerical result shows that, the proposed method can achieve higher malicious user detection accuracy than the existing reputation-based schemes, and can thus improve the CSS performance significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992078/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14824834","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992078/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Counteracting malicious users in cognitive radio networks over imperfect reporting channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counteracting malicious users in cognitive radio networks over imperfect reporting channels","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570001959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087322S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992079,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085432025"},{"name":"Shanshan Tang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085579950"},{"name":"Jin-Yuan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jin-Yuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716383900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992079","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","OFDM","Adaptive optics","Optical distortion","Atmospheric modeling","Noise","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error rate","free-space optical communications system","direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","statistical model"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the impacts of biasing and clipping on free-space optical (FSO) communications system over weak turbulence channel employing direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM).

In such systems, the most challenging difficulty in beamforming designs comes from the fact that the nodes consisting the virtual MIMO are subjected to individual power constraints or named per-antenna power constraints instead of sum power constraints. The instinct individual power constraints for virtual MIMO prohibit the derivation for closed-form solutions. Although in existing works, it has been revealed that under per-antenna power constraints the design problems are still convex and can be efficiently solved using some famous convex optimization tools such as semidefinite programming (SDP). Unfortunately, it is far from desired for practical implementations. In our work, linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) beamforming is designed under per-antenna power constraints. Exploiting the hidden convexity, an iterative solution is proposed, which has clear structure and well-suited for virtual MIMO communications e.g, the uplink of Machine-to-Machine (M2M)communications in cellular networks. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed design.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992086","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992086.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity LMMSE beamforming design for uplink virtual MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992086/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity LMMSE beamforming design for uplink virtual MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824956","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992086/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity LMMSE beamforming design for uplink virtual MIMO systems","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570002695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057056S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6992087,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Gao","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085515220"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538668500"},{"name":"Zhengyuan Xu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085336087"},{"name":"Yingbo Hua","affiliation":["University of California at Riverside, California, USA"],"firstName":"Yingbo","lastName":"Hua","id":"37276939700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992087","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Image color analysis","Optimization","Light emitting diodes","Color","Receivers","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","concave programming","convex programming","least mean squares methods","light emitting diodes","minimisation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint beamformer design method","offset design method","multicolor visible light communication","red-green-blue light emitting diode","lighting constraints","optical power","color illumination","non-negativeness","CRI","LER","nonconvex optimization problem","mean squared error","MSE minimization","approximation method","nonconvex constraint","standard water filling method","channel crosstalk","offset allocation optimization","RGB LED","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming design","visible light communication","IM/DD","RGB LED","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new joint beamformer and offset design method for visible light communication (VLC) with multiple red/green/blue light emitting diodes (RGB LED).

The SUs are assumed to carry delay-sensitive services, thus the concept of effective capacity, which is defined as the maximum supported constant arrival rate under the delay quality of service (QoS) constraint, is adopted. Beside the delay QoS constraint, the interference power constraint and the transmit power constraint are also considered. The problem of joint channel allocation and power allocation to maximize the sum effective capacity of the SUs under the aforementioned constraints is investigated. A heuristic joint channel and power allocation scheme is proposed. It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves significantly higher sum effective capacity compared to the reference scheme, especially for stringent interference power constraint and loose transmit power constraint. It is also shown that the sum effective capacity is more sensitive to the variation of the delay QoS constraint under loose delay QoS constraint than that under stringent delay QoS constraint.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992100","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992100.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992100","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation in delay-QoS constrained multiuser cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation in delay-QoS constrained multiuser cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992100/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992100/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824941","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation in delay-QoS constrained multiuser cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570003857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048714S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6992103,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","The State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085382106"},{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","The State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405247500"},{"name":"Zhangpeng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhangpeng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085392071"},{"name":"Xiaoying Gan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Gan","id":"37291571900"},{"name":"Zhifeng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085388155"},{"name":"Dong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085377634"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992103","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"abstract":"Rapid demands for large capacity services and shortage spectrum resources have motivated the deployment of small cells in LTE-A network. Small cells are low-cost, low power nodes with limited coverage region, as the existence of small cells, more sophisticated network architecture increases the difficulty in dealing with mobility management. The contradiction between traffic demands and network resources is also very prominent, the rationally tradeoff between high quality service demands and signaling overhead in HO procedure should be considered in mobility management. Aiming at solving these issues, efficient handover (HO) mechanisms are more and more concerned to enhance mobility management in small cell networks. In this paper, we proposed a Self-Organizing Networks (SON) based Double Thresholds Optimization (DTO) handover algorithm, which offers an efficient method to mitigate handover signaling overhead while satisfying user's requirements of service quality. Specifically, through optimizing two key HO parameters associated with HO procedure, DTO enhances mobility robustness management effectively. Furthermore, a system-level LTE simulator is implemented to evaluate the mobility performance. The results strongly verify that the proposed DTO algorithm can assist LTE network in achieving an appropriate compromise between handover (HO) signaling overhead and quality of service (QoS), besides, load balance is acquired with rational allocation of resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992103.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive double thresholds handover mechanism in small cell LTE-A network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Load modeling","Handover","Quality of service","Mobile communication","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","optimisation","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication signalling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive double threshold handover mechanism","small cell LTE-A network","shortage spectrum resource","mobility management","traffic demand","signaling overhead","HO procedure","handover mechanism","self-organizing network","SON","double threshold optimization","DTO","system-level LTE simulator","quality of service","QoS","load balancing","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive double thresholds handover mechanism in small cell LTE-A network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992103/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824965","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive double thresholds handover mechanism in small cell LTE-A network","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570003919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065208S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6992107,"authors":[{"name":"Yuting Wang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085588464"},{"name":"Zhisong Bie","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisong","lastName":"Bie","id":"37300654900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992107","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992107","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Mathematical model","Hardware","Computer architecture","Accuracy","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","Gaussian noise","probability","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware Gaussian noise generator","Box-Muller","coordinate rotation digital computer algorithm","CORDIC","clock cycle","Gaussian probability density function","Xilinx XC4VLX15 Virtex-4 device","field-programmable gate array","FPGA","word length 16 bit","frequency 155 MHz"]}],"abstract":"A novel hardware Gaussian noise generator based on the Box-Muller method and the Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) Algorithm is presented.

Although the resulting time-and-frequency-selective (or namely, doubly selective) fading may degrade the system performance, it also enables possible multipath and Doppler diversity when the system is properly designed. In this paper, based on the basis expansion model (BEM) and the time-frequency domain transformation, an Adaptive Vector OFDM (AVOFDM) transmission scheme is proposed. It is demonstrated that AVOFDM can achieve considerable joint Multipath-Doppler diversity gain over doubly selective channels, which is even more closer to the upper bound of the maximum achievable multipath-Doppler diversity in comparison with that can be achieved by the traditional non-adaptive Vector OFDM. Furthermore, the number of bits carried by each modulated symbol increases and the overhead cost by the 2-dimension cyclic prefix is reduced. Both factors contribute to an increased data throughput.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992109","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992109.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive vector OFDM system for transmission over doubly selective fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive vector OFDM system for transmission over doubly selective fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992109/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824821","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992109/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive vector OFDM system for transmission over doubly selective fading channels","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570004099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058158S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6992113,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405035300"},{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280645100"},{"name":"Dahai Han","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dahai","lastName":"Han","id":"37085389120"},{"name":"Qing Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Li","id":"38225936700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992113","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"abstract":"The enhanced visible light communications (VLC) system with transmission distance of 7m is demonstrated using transmission path design and forward error correction code in this paper.

Recently, the application of LT code in satellite communication has attracted lots of interest, because the bad communication environment and large transmission delay make HARQ not so efficient as in terrestrial environment. Therefore, we investigate the performance of LT code with both decoding schemes in satellite communication, and make a comparison to HARQ. In order to exclude the effect of absolute transmission delay due to different orbit attitude, we introduce receiving efficiency to evaluate the receiving delay of different transmission schemes. As shown by simulation, by utilizing the corrupted packets, LT code could achieve better performance than HARQ.

In addition, we make some tests in the water tank for our transceiver under different symbol modulation and signal bandwidth, and develop a functionality of image transmission between the transceivers.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992117","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP implementation of OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication transceiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DSP implementation of OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication transceiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992117/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824898","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992117/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP implementation of OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication transceiver","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570004263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04692S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6992129,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085574884"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240343100"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280464200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992129","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Capacity planning","Antennas","Vectors","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","numerical analysis","probability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","probability density functions","SNR","signal-to-noise ratio","MISOSE","multiple antennas","cellular scenario","eavesdropper Eve","legitimate receiver Bob","transmitter Alice","wiretap channel model","secrecy outage probability","non-zero secrecy capacity","noise injection","beamforming","physical layer security"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing physical layer security through beamforming and noise injection","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992129","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992129","abstract":"In this paper, we evaluate how much beamforming and noise injection can improve physical layer security by deriving the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and the secrecy outage probability.

However, as the UER needs to use its own power for the other UE's data transmission, the D2D communication can be unfair to the UER. To overcome this issue, motivated by the recent advance in energy harvesting (EH) techniques, we consider the D2D communication provided EH cellular network (D2D-EHCN) where the UERs harvest RF energy from a base station (BS) and use the harvested energy for D2D communications. We first derive the UER distribution by taking into account the EH parameters, and propose the transmission mode selection scheme including the UER selection method. After deriving the outage probability of the D2D-EHCN, we explore the effects of the network parameters on the outage probability. Particularly, we show that the outage probability of D2D-EHCN is smaller than that of the cellular network without D2D communication, and their difference becomes more significant when the density of BSs is small.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992131","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992131.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green device-to-device communication with harvesting energy in cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992131/","displayDocTitle":"Green device-to-device communication with harvesting energy in cellular networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824819","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992131/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green device-to-device communication with harvesting energy in cellular networks","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570004529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07014S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6992133,"authors":[{"name":"Yidi Yang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Yidi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085486334"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085449810"},{"name":"Zhicheng Li","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Zhicheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085496127"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992133","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Array signal processing","Throughput","Interference","Heuristic algorithms","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","beamforming technique","MDC multicast","OFDM-based CRN","downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","cognitive radio networks","cognitive base station","multiple antennas","multiple description coding multicast model","MDCM model","power transmission","interference threshold","primary user","two-step suboptimal scheme","interference management","throughput maximization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a resource allocation scheme for downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in which the cognitive base station (BS) is equipped with multiple antennas.

Double-sided clipping is necessary due to the unipolarity of the optical intensity-modulated, direct-detected (IM/DD) system and power limit of the transmitter. Symmetric double-sided clipping is adopted to achieve wider dynamic range. Clipping noise is analyzed for system performance investigation. The optimal DC bias value is deduced by minimizing the system bit error ratio (BER) at given transmitter optical power. An equation of signal to noise ratio (SNR), signal energy, and optimal DC bias value is derived. Finally, the optimal algorithm is verified through a BER simulation at different DC bias values.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal symmetric double-sided signal clipping in DCO-OFDM visible light communication","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992147","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992147.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal symmetric double-sided signal clipping in DCO-OFDM visible light communication","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992147/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824907","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal symmetric double-sided signal clipping in DCO-OFDM visible light communication","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570005009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063313S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6992152,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085338568"},{"name":"Qiang Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37709690700"},{"name":"Jue Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nantong University, Nantong, China","Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085338056"},{"name":"Chen Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37557551900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992152","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Antennas","Joints","MIMO","Fading","OFDM","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","gradient methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subgradient power allocation algorithm","antenna selection method","single objective optimization problem","multiobjective problem","RAU","remote access unit","transmission power constraint","distributed multiple-input multiple-output systems","orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing","antenna selection scheme","energy efficient OFDM D-MIMO systems","joint power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna selection","energy efficiency","OFDM","distributed MIMO","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a joint power allocation and antenna selection scheme for orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) systems.

In this scenario, the BS is equipped with multiple antennas, and each user is wiretapped by a specific eavesdropper where each user or eavesdropper is equipped with one antenna. It is supposed that the BS employs transmit beamforming with a given requirement on sum transmitting power. The object is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of the network, which leads to a nonconvex complicated structure, and makes he considered beamforming design problem difficult to handle. To solve this problem, a beamforming design scheme is proposed to transform the original problem into a convex approximation problem, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation technique based on Taylor expansion. Besides, with the advantage of low complexity, a zero-forcing (ZF) based beamforming method is presented in the case that BS is able to nullify he eavesdroppers' rate. Numerical results show that the former strategy achieves better performance than the later one, which is mainly due to the ability of optimizing beamforming direction, and both outperform the traditional signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14824813","htmlLink":"/document/6992154/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming design of sum secrecy rate optimization for MU-MISO channel under sum power constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming design of sum secrecy rate optimization for MU-MISO channel under sum power constraint","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570005441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077485S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6992162,"authors":[{"name":"Boya Qin","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Boya","lastName":"Qin","id":"37085530684"},{"name":"Yunlong Cai","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yunlong","lastName":"Cai","id":"37595612300"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"},{"name":"Minjian Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Minjian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292300200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992162","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose two complexity reduction techniques for blind adaptive beamforming in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) antenna array systems. For each sub-carrier, a beamformer with generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure is designed according to the constrained constant modulus (CCM) criterion with weight vectors adaptation based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. The two techniques that we propose for complexity reduction rely on frequency domain interpolation and spatial domain clustering, respectively. The former exploits the coherence bandwidth of the radio channel, so that only the weight vectors at selected frequencies need to be adapted, while the remaining weight vectors are obtained via interpolation. The latter relies on the partitioning of the receiving array into sub-arrays of smaller size. In addition, a combination of these two techniques is proposed to further reduce the complexity. A complexity analysis is presented to quantify the computational savings offered by the proposed techniques. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate that these savings can be obtained at the price of only a minor, acceptable loss in performance when compared to the direct application of the conventional CCM-RLS-GSC beamforming algorithm to the wideband OFDM antenna array systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992162.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity reduction techniques for blind adaptive beamforming in OFDM antenna arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","OFDM","Complexity theory","Interpolation","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadband antennas","communication complexity","interpolation","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity reduction technique","blind adaptive beamforming","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM antenna array system","GSC structure","generalized sidelobe canceller structure","constrained constant modulus criterion","CCM criterion","weight vector adaptation","recursive least square method","RLS method","frequency domain interpolation","spatial domain clustering","radio channel","vector","receiving antenna array","computational saving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind adaptive beamforming","OFDM","frequency interpolation technique","spatial clustering technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Complexity reduction techniques for blind adaptive beamforming in OFDM antenna arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824961","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity reduction techniques for blind adaptive beamforming in OFDM antenna arrays","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570005565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048113S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6992166,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085555063"},{"name":"Shengqian Han","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shengqian","lastName":"Han","id":"37404245200"},{"name":"Chenyang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279099600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992166","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Complexity theory","Information management","Signal to noise ratio","Joints","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized multicell coordinated beamforming","downlink coordinated beamforming schemes","base station","information sharing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992166","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992166","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","abstract":"This paper studies downlink coordinated beamforming schemes with overlapped clusters, where a base station (BS) may belong to multiple clusters selected by different users.

However, during each cooperative sensing process, extra energy is consumed by the selected sensors through local sensing, data reporting, and data fusion activities. Thus, cooperative sensing processes call for energy efficiency. This paper investigates two practical optimization problems related to energy efficient cooperative sensing issue. One focuses on the sensors selection in a single process, with the objective to minimize the total energy consumption meanwhile the expected sensing performances are achieved. The other is an online problem, which schedules participant sensors for each process with the aim to enable the network to perform as many as cooperative sensing processes, therefore increasing the network lifetime. Due to the NP-hardness of the proposed problems, we propose heuristic algorithms for them respectively. Extensive experiments by simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Using the proposed algorithms, more cooperative sensing processes can be realized and the network lifetime can be extended significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14824904","htmlLink":"/document/6992169/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient cooperative sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient cooperative sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570005697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067364S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992170,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","College of Science, Zhejiang A & F University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085383809"},{"name":"Li Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yu","id":"37289752200"},{"name":"Peng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085390326"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992170","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Stochastic processes","Upper bound","Calculus","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calculus","cognitive radio","quality of service","stochastic processes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","stochastic network calculus","QoS","wireless spectrum utilization","per-user throughput","primary users","secondary users","spectrum sensing","sensing errors","quality of service analysis","computer networks","arrival process"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio is a promising technique in improving the utilization of wireless spectrum by spectrum sensing.

In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze the per-user throughput of both primary users and secondary users. Based on this framework, we further estimate how sensing errors influence the throughput in cognitive radio networks. To this end, stochastic network calculus is employed as a basic tool, which is a powerful theory for quality of service analysis of computer networks. Impairment processes of service are introduced to construct the service models for both primary users and secondary users. Then per-user throughput bounds of both primary users and secondary users are obtained after considering arrival process of primary users. Numerical result shows that sensing errors play a decisive role on the upper bound of primary users' throughput, while have less impact on the lower bound of secondary users' throughput.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992170","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992170.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992170","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput analysis of cognitive radio networks via stochastic network calculus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Throughput analysis of cognitive radio networks via stochastic network calculus","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992170/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992170/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824958","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput analysis of cognitive radio networks via stochastic network calculus","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570005705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050603S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6992175,"authors":[{"name":"Le Dong","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085461650"},{"name":"Ziyu Zhao","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ziyu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085453170"},{"name":"Jing Lei","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Lei","id":"37652895400"},{"name":"Er-bao Li","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Er-bao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085415311"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992175","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992175","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge carrier processes","Decoding","Floors","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","mobile communication","parity check codes","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degree distribution","node rearrangement method","BER system","bit error rate","deep space communications","disk storage","wireless mobile communications","trapping sets elimination","LDPC codes","lower error floor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity check(LDPC) codes","trapping sets","elimination algorithm","structure optimization","error floor"]}],"abstract":"LDPC codes with excellent performance have great potential in applications of wireless mobile communications.

In general, the satellite communication systems have a long channel delay, and then traditional adaptation schemes suffer from performance degradation. To overcome this drawback, we propose to add statistical channel state information (CSI) into the designing of adaptive coding schemes, where statistical CSI is obtained by averaging instantaneous CSI. Also, because the reciprocity property is utilized, the statistical CSI-aided adaptation scheme does not need to feed back any CSI. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptation scheme outperforms existing ones in term of spectral efficiency, especially when the maximum channel delay is very great.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992176","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992176.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive coding method for dual-polarized mobile satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992176/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive coding method for dual-polarized mobile satellite communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824974","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992176/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive coding method for dual-polarized mobile satellite communications","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570005785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076307S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992177,"authors":[{"name":"Liuyihan Song","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Liuyihan","lastName":"Song","id":"37085499226"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Network Technology, Hangzhou, China","Dept. of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139400"},{"name":"Huifang Chen","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Network Technology, Hangzhou, China","Dept. of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Huifang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293466200"},{"name":"Kuang Wang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Network Technology, Hangzhou, China","Dept. of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Kuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37402608600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992177","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Member and Geographic Activities Board committees","Decoding","Channel coding","Reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","decoding","feedback","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback-based secrecy coding scheme","polar code","degraded wiretap channel","nondegraded wiretap channel","feedback architecture","encoding","decoding","reliability","secure communication","feedback channel","forward channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar code","feedback","non-degraded wiretap channels","secrecy code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992177","abstract":"Polar codes can be used to achieve secrecy capacity of degraded wiretap channels.

One of the promising approaches to share the frequency spectrum in STICS is dynamic spectrum assignment, which dynamically divides the spectrum into two parts according to the traffic demand of terrestrial service and satellite service. As smaller bandwidth can be allocated to satellite networks, it is required to increase the bandwidth per cell by decreasing the frequency reuse factor, which results in larger inter-cell interference. This is much worse for users at the edge of the satellite cell as the coverage of satellite beam is much flatter than that of terrestrial cell. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a scheme of dynamic channel assignment scheme with cooperative beam forming, in which adjacent beams will serve the edge users cooperatively.

Quasi users are selected based on constraint coefficients which are defined according to difference of propagation delay first. And then, the average of correlation values is calculated after deleting quasi users. Finally, the peak to average ratio is chosen as decision variable in this algorithm.

In this paper, we study the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, where each user applies power splitting to coordinate the energy harvesting and information decoding processes while secrecy information requirement is guaranteed. The problem is formulated to maximize the aggregate harvested power at the users while satisfying secrecy rate requirements of all users by subcarrier allocation and the optimal power splitting ratio selection.

In this paper, we propose compressed-sensing recovery of MVS exploiting the model of structural group sparse representation (SGSR) along with a targeted database. SGSR groups similar patches together coupled with learning the adaptive basis from the similar groups, which gets sparser representation and thereby performs better in CS recovery. A targeted database can be easily obtained from the MVS due to their abundant prior information and the database can help us obtain more accurate similar patches, which further improve the performance with SGSR. Considering images as compressible signals rather than sparse signals, we design a filtering to retain the details of images. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing reconstruction algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992202","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992202.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing recovery of multi-view video sequences by targeted database","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992202/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing recovery of multi-view video sequences by targeted database","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824838","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992202/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing recovery of multi-view video sequences by targeted database","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570013711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051179S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6992203,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Yang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085428530"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Wendong Yang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wendong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290576900"},{"name":"Jianchao Zheng","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38238014300"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37592504100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992203","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Interference","Power demand","Resource management","Energy efficiency","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","energy conservation","frequency allocation","OFDM modulation","power consumption","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective fading","HFR strategy","highest frequency reuse strategy","subcarrier reduction","power allocation","bit loading","relay selection","EE","circuit power consumption minimization","transmit power","multiple relay nodes","destination node","source node","orthogonal division multiplexing multirelay networks","OFDM multirelay cellular networks","energy efficient resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy efficiency","subcarrier allocation","relay selection","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates energy efficient resource allocation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multi-relay networks, where the source node communicates with the destination node via multiple relay nodes. Both transmit power and circuit power consumption are taken into consideration. The objective is to minimize the overall power consumption so as to achieve high energy efficiency (EE). Relay selection, bit loading, power allocation and subcarrier reduction are involved in this paper. Moreover, we propose a frequency reuse strategy named highest frequency reuse (HFR), to cut down the interference between cells. This HFR strategy deletes subcarriers which suffers from serious frequency selective fading and uses better subcarriers for transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation can enhance the EE of the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient resource allocation for OFDM multi-relay cellular networks","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992203","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992203.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient resource allocation for OFDM multi-relay cellular networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992203/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824953","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient resource allocation for OFDM multi-relay cellular networks","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570013727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052555S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992206,"authors":[{"name":"Guangjie Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guangjie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085489730"},{"name":"Huali Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huali","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085497732"},{"name":"Weijun Zeng","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weijun","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37061752200"},{"name":"Qingguo Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qingguo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085487133"},{"name":"Jun Jin","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Jin","id":"37677714100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7339-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992206","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Sensors","Wideband","Noise measurement","Shift registers","Robustness","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sampling","cyclic measurement matrices","wideband sub-Nyquist sampling","modulated wideband converter","binary measurement matrix","random Bernoulli matrix","shift registers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992206","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992003","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971896/6992003/06992206.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sampling using structurally mixed cyclic measurement matrices","abstract":"The measurement matrix plays an important role in the hardware implementation of wideband sub-Nyquist sampling. In modulated wideband converter (MWC), the measurement sequences are derived from binary measurement matrix, e.g., random Bernoulli matrix, which can be easily implemented by M \u00d7N shift registers. Utilizing the special cyclic structure, partial circulant measurement matrix only needs N shift registers, which greatly reduces the hardware complexity of the measurement circuits. However, the diminishment of randomness makes it sensitive to the signal noise and not universal to all the sparse position. In this paper, we propose the structurally mixed cyclic matrices to enhance the randomness of cyclic measurement structure. They have two parts of randomness: randomness in the generating sequence and randomness in the fixed mixture circuits. Especially, logically mixed cyclic matrix has the similar compressive performance, noisy robustness and universality with Bernoulli matrix. It is more suitable for compressed sampling of arbitrary-dimensionality spectrally sparse signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992206/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824807","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sampling using structurally mixed cyclic measurement matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sampling using structurally mixed cyclic measurement matrices","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"1570013811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074408S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971896","isNumber":"6992003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971896","xplore-issue":"6992003","articleId":"6992206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6992212,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Comm.

Then the optimization mathematical model of energy efficiency is given by using frame period and sensing time. The optimization problem is analyzed theoretically and verified by computer simulations.

The sidebands of the 4D array are utilized to generate multiple orthogonal carrier frequencies and transmit signals. The time sequences are optimized by the differential evolution (DE) algorism to synthesize a desired radiation pattern with a better directivity compared to frequency division MIMO. A linear FM (LFM) pulse signal is input to the 4D array and is spread at the center frequency and a few sidebands in the same direction. An analytic expression for the cross correlation function of these sideband signals is presented to study the relationship between pulse duration and time-modulated frequency. Without the use of numerical mixers, the 4D-OF is a good candidate for the MIMO radar.

In particular, when the desired signal is present in training snapshots, the adaptive beamforming is quite sensitive to desired signal steering vector mismatch. Therefore, a robust adaptive beamforming for actual system is proposed based on the reconstruction of interference covariance matrix and mismatched steering vector compensation. In the proposed method, the interference covariance matrix is firstly reconstructed by using Root-MUSIC method to estimate Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) of signals, where the desired signal component is removed from the training snapshots. Subsequently, the mismatched desired signal steering vector is compensated by solving a quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem. Simulation results show that the performance of proposed algorithm outperforms the existing robust adaptive beamforming, and the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is close to optimal values.

It consists of two layers to achieve a compact topology through a standard PCB fabrication process. The wideband substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) feeding network is placed in the bottom layer while the radiating patches are on the top layer. A novel feeding structure is proposed to widen the bandwidth in terms of impedance matching and gain. Measured results of the fabricated array show about 14.6% of reflection coefficient bandwidth (S11<;-10dB) in the frequency band 57~66 GHz. The gain fluctuates less than 1.5 dB within the same band.

But in practice, some errors of DOA estimation and array geometries will bring the uncertainty of steering vector of the desired signal. Then, investigation is needed to solve the beamforming problem when steering vector error is uncertain. In this paper, we propose a robust adaptive rank-reducing minimum variance beamforming (FRRMVB) algorithm with multi-stage Wiener filter (MSWF) to correct the beam-pointing error. By using MSWF, we construct the signal subspace, and use projection method to correct steering vector of the desired signal. By using the different sampling date in radar resting period and working period, we overcome the problem of interference suppression in low signal-to-interference ratio cases. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm have high robustness over steering vector error. And the algorithm is suitable for engineering applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14824754","htmlLink":"/document/6992484/","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming based on fast rank-reducing MVB algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamforming based on fast rank-reducing MVB algorithm","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"1306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057842S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963206","isNumber":"6992393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963206","xplore-issue":"6992393","articleId":"6992484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6992485,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Hua Zong","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Hua","lastName":"Zong","id":"37085367988"},{"name":"Chang-Hong Li","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Chang-Hong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085370414"},{"name":"Xiao-Yun Qu","affiliation":["China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Yun","lastName":"Qu","id":"37085350265"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992485","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Mobile antennas","3G mobile communication","Bandwidth","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","mobile antennas","multifrequency antennas","planar inverted-F antennas","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart mobile phone","frequency bandwidth","metal strip antenna","PCB antenna","antenna bandwidth","miniature antennas","multiband antennas","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["internal handset antenns","multiband antennas","bandwidth"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992485","doi":"10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992485","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","abstract":"The antenna applied in a smart mobile phone is desired with low profile and wide frequency bandwidth.

The first antenna is capable of covering GSM900, GSM1800, GSM1900, and UMTS. It has two loop type antenna elements, which are with the same structures and dimensions. The dimensions of the antenna element is 22.5*25mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. Two structures which are slot and inverted-L branches on the ground, are used to minimize the mature coupling between the two antenna elements. The second antenna can cover GSM1800, GSM1900, UMTS, WLAN and LTE frequency bands. The presented antenna consist of two coupled fed monopole antennas that are oriented diagonally at the non-grounded portion of the circuit board. Two decoupling structures are etched diagonally on the bottom layer of the circuit board to improve the isolation between the two antenna elements. Both of simulation and measurement results are shown to illustrate the performance of the proposed two MIMO antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963206/6992393/06992512.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"414","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO antennas for mobile handsets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO","Mobile antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna feeds","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","mobile handsets","monopole antenna arrays","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband MIMO antennas","mobile handsets","GSM900 frequency band","GSM1800 frequency band","GSM1900 frequency band","UMTS frequency band","loop type antenna elements","multiple input multiple output technology","circuit board","LTE frequency band","WLAN frequency band","coupled fed monopole antennas","inverted-L branches","slot branches","mature coupling minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoupling","MIMO antenna","monopole","multiband antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"MIMO antennas for mobile handsets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14824674","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO antennas for mobile handsets","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"1401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069426S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963206","isNumber":"6992393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963206","xplore-issue":"6992393","articleId":"6992512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6992542,"authors":[{"name":"Yilong Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yilong","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085387206"},{"name":"Yue Tang","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Tang","id":"37535631000"},{"name":"Haobin Zhang","affiliation":["Electronic Information Control Laboratories, China"],"firstName":"Haobin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085472207"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992542","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992542","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Array signal processing","Apertures","Gratings","Educational institutions","Linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","linear antenna arrays","signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thinned multiresolution composite array","high resolution digital beamforming","MRCA","DBF","uniform linear array","multiplicative linear arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna array","linear antenna array","digital beamforming","multi-resolution composite array"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992542","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963206/6992393/06992542.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thinned multi-resolution composite array for high resolution digital beamforming","abstract":"This paper presents a novel multi-resolution composite array (MRCA) concept for high resolution digital beamforming (DBF) with much less elements than conventional uniform linear array.

At the receiver, the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) rule is adopted for signal detection. At the transmitter, adaptive power allocation scheme based on Lagrange multiplier method is presented to allocate appropriate power to each antenna. However, the bit error rate (BER) performance of V-BLAST system degrades with the increase of channel correlation, then a decorrelation method is proposed based on beam-forming technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TPA scheme combined with the decorrelation method is more effectively than the traditional equal power allocation. The BER performance of the correlated V-BLAST system can be well improved with the proposed algorithm.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963206/6992393/06992604.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"744","doi":"10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation algorithm for V-BLAST system with channel correlation and estimation error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation algorithm for V-BLAST system with channel correlation and estimation error","htmlLink":"/document/6992604/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14824718","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation algorithm for V-BLAST system with channel correlation and estimation error","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"2286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056025S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963206","isNumber":"6992393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963206","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6992393","articleId":"6992604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992623,"authors":[{"name":"Boyang Feng","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085411172"},{"name":"Qingbo Ji","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qingbo","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085409078"},{"name":"Yun Lin","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085397030"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992623","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992623","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Signal to noise ratio","Wavelet transforms","Feature extraction","Modulation","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation signals identification","low signal-to-noise ratios","digitally modulated signals","SNR","wavelet transforms","manifold learning method","M-QAM signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["signal identification","digital modulation","wavelet transform","manifold learning","Isomap"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992623","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963206/6992393/06992623.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"814","endPage":"817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of quadrature amplitude modulation signals identification at low signal-to-noise ratios","abstract":"Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) was developed to rapidly and automatically identify the modulation levels of digitally modulated signals at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

Two low-noise, well impedance-matched radio frequency amplifiers working at various nearby center working frequencies, 2.6 GHz and 2.8 GHz, are proposed using Class-E power amplifier mechanism. Both are deliberately put in series such that both can couple with each other, The resulting gain (S21) is as high as 75dB at 2.1GHz and increased approximately by summing over the two individual gains (S21\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.6GHz</sub>\n and S21\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.8GHz</sub>\n) just as expected. It is speculated that the enhanced features of S21 do not make the entering signals available for applications unless the signals are not rejected completely. Thus, even the slight chances of passing signals (S11 below 0 dB) are worth doing so because the gigantic gains can cover the lost reflected signals. It is even more encouraging to find S11 and S22 below 0 dB to be widened on the frequency responses, especially including S11 and S22 at 2.1 GHz, for example, which is originally exclusive prior to the combination of the two individual amplifiers. S12 addressing the isolation of the output from the input is always kept low enough and the minimum noise figures (NF\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n) are mostly below 1.0. Therefore, the promoted applicable range of radio frequency on the amplifiers assures the promising futures on the low noise power amplifiers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAP.2014.6992716","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Antennas

To improve load modulation, the peaking amplifier is designed to achieve similar output current with that of the carrier amplifier by choosing optimal load impedances in class C mode and higher gate biasing voltage. Moreover, to achieve enhanced efficiency at large back-off power, a modified load modulation network (LMN) is designed. To verify those methods, an enhanced Doherty PA and a Doherty PA exploiting modified LMN are designed and measured, respectively.

The presence of occlusion hinders accurate identification and classification in automatic karyotyping and a manual intervention is needed to complete the procedure. For this reason, karyotyping is not completely automatic and a novel technique based on bio-inspired optimization algorithms is proposed to identify the individual chromosomes even in the presence of occlusion. The technique employs stochastic search algorithms including the Firefly algorithm (FA), Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle swarm Optimization (PSO) in resolving occlusion, by starting with a random population of solutions from the image of occluded chromosomes and recursively doing operations borrowed from evolutionary methods and swarm intelligence, on the population. The hidden chromosomes are identified after a certain number of iterations. The technique performs well, even when 80% of the chromosome is occluded by the other. The performance of the stochastic search algorithms in resolving chromosomal occlusions is evaluated and FA gives superior results in identifying the occluded chromosomes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992928","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06992928.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","startPage":"48","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of bio-inspired optimization algorithms in resolving chromosomal occlusions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of bio-inspired optimization algorithms in resolving chromosomal occlusions","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992928/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825214","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992928/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of bio-inspired optimization algorithms in resolving chromosomal occlusions","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058952S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6992928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6992935,"authors":[{"name":"Gurrala Ajay Kumar","affiliation":["Department of ECE, SASTRA University Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India"],"firstName":"Gurrala Ajay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085548552"},{"name":"Thadigotla Venkata Subbareddy","affiliation":["Department of ECE, SASTRA University Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India"],"firstName":"Thadigotla Venkata","lastName":"Subbareddy","id":"37085359948"},{"name":"Bommepalli Madhava Reddy","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, SASTRA Univerisity, Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India"],"firstName":"Bommepalli Madhava","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37085356847"},{"name":"N Raju","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, SASTRA Univerisity, Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India"],"firstName":"N","lastName":"Raju","id":"38232548400"},{"name":"V Elamaran","affiliation":["Department of ECE, SASTRA University Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India"],"firstName":"V","lastName":"Elamaran","id":"38235398300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4191-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4193-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4192-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992935","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":958},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Pins","Signal processing algorithms","Educational institutions","Matrix converters","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","logic design","matrix inversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix inversion hardware module","adjoint matrix method","VHDL code","synthesizability","hardware verification","Altera DE1 board","Cyclone-II series EP2C20F484C7 FPGA","on board GPIO","UI","SRAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adjoint method","Altera DE1","FPGA","Matrix inversion","VHDL"]}],"abstract":"This study work is basically aimed at designing and testing of hardware module to perform inversion operation of a matrix in a small time.

OFDM is a modulation technique in which the other subcarriers have zero amplitude at the peak of each subcarrier. Since it is an effective solution to inter symbol interference caused by a dispersive channel, OFDM can be used in most new and emerging broadband wired and wireless communication systems. The main drawback of OFDM is its high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) that can be alleviated by an effective technique called the pilot-assisted PAPR reduction technique. This technique is much more efficient than clipping method. This paper makes the comparison of conventional optical OFDM (OOFDM) and pilotassisted OOFDM (PA-OOFDM) so as to show that PA-OOFDM completely eliminates the PAPR. The comparison of BER performance of BPSK and QAM is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992952","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06992952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","startPage":"178","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OPTICAL OFDM \u2014 A superior technology in wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OPTICAL OFDM \u2014 A superior technology in wireless communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992952/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825213","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6992952/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OPTICAL OFDM \u2014 A superior technology in wireless communication","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051725S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6992952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6992964,"authors":[{"name":"Madhurima Rana","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Madhurima","lastName":"Rana","id":"37085442325"},{"name":"Saurabh Bilgaiyan","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Bilgaiyan","id":"37085428571"},{"name":"Utsav Kar","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Utsav","lastName":"Kar","id":"37085433871"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4191-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4193-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4192-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992964","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":794},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on load balancing in cloud computing environment using evolutionary and swarm based algorithms","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06992964.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992964","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Cloud computing","Ant colony optimization","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed processing","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load balancing","cloud computing","evolutionary algorithm","swarm based algorithm","distributed computing","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","load balancing","evolutionary algorithms","swarm based algorithms","quality of services (QoS)","distributed computing","genetic algorithm (GA)","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","ant colony optimization (ACO)","artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992964","abstract":"Literature meaning of cloud computing is distributed computing, storing, sharing and accessing data over the Internet. It provides a pool of shared resources to the users available on the basis of pay as you go service, means users pay only for those services which are used by him according to their access times. The data processing and storage amount is increasing quickly day by day in cloud environment. This leads to an uneven distribution of overall work on cloud resources. So a proper balance of overall load over the available resources is a major issue in cloud computing paradigm. Load balancing ensures that no single node will be overloaded and used to distribute workload among multiple nodes. It helps to improve system performance and proper utilization of resources. It also minimizes the time and cost involved in such big computing models. Load balancing and better resource utilization is provided by many existing algorithms. To overcome load balancing problem this paper provides a summary of evolutionary and swarm based algorithms which will help to overcome such problem in different environment of cloud.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825074","htmlLink":"/document/6992964/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study on load balancing in cloud computing environment using evolutionary and swarm based algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on load balancing in cloud computing environment using evolutionary and swarm based algorithms","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073927S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6992964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6992965,"authors":[{"name":"Sameer Garg","affiliation":["Electrical Electronics and Instrumentation Department, Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani, Goa, India"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Garg","id":"37085422818"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4191-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4193-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4192-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992965","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Stability criteria","Circuit stability","Thermal stability","Simulation","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristors","model reference adaptive control systems","perturbation techniques","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor based model reference adaptive controller analysis","MRAC","electrical element","system stability","perturbation factors","stability controller","continuous stability","mathematical reasoning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memristor","stability analysis","controller","adaptive controller"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, for the first time, we propose an adaptive controller based on a new electrical element \u201cMemristor\u201d which will not only improve the system stability and performance, but also maintain that stability for a longer time, irrespective of different perturbation factors.

The objective of this paper is to design an area efficient fully parallel distributed arithmetic (DA) architecture for one-dimensional DCT to be implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA). DCT requires large amount of mathematical computations including multiplications and accumulations. The multipliers consume increased power and area; hence multipliers are completely discarded in the proposed design. Distributed arithmetic is a method of modification at bit stream for sum of product or vector dot product to hide the multiplications. DA is very much suitable for FPGA designs as it reduces the size of a multiply and accumulate hardware. The speed is increased in the proposed design with the fully parallel approach. In this work, existing DA architecture for 1D-DCT and the proposed area efficient fully parallel DA architecture for 1D-DCT are realized. The simulation is performed using Modelsim6.2b and synthesized with Xilinx IS E Simulator. The 1D-DCT can be extended to 2D-DCT by using row column decomposition technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992973","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06992973.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area efficient fully parallel distributed arithmetic architecture for one-dimensional discrete cosine transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992973/","displayDocTitle":"Area efficient fully parallel distributed arithmetic architecture for one-dimensional discrete cosine transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825118","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992973/","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area efficient fully parallel distributed arithmetic architecture for one-dimensional discrete cosine transform","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07208S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6992973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6992974,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Kishore Kodali","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Ravi Kishore","lastName":"Kodali","id":"38552824600"},{"name":"Satya Kesav Gundabathula","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Satya Kesav","lastName":"Gundabathula","id":"37085361972"},{"name":"Lakshmi Boppana","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Lakshmi","lastName":"Boppana","id":"37073329700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4191-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4193-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4192-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992974","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":719},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of IEEE-754 floating point Karatsuba multiplier","abstract":"The floating point arithmetic, specifically multiplication, is a widely used computational operation in many scientific and signal processing applications.

Traditionally, most of the work in the field of reconfigurable computing was focused on fine-grained FPGA devices. Over the years, the focus was shifted from bit level granularity to a more coarse grained composition. In this paper, we present the synthesis of high-throughput and area efficient data path for reconfigurable Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. FIR filters have been and continue to be important building blocks in many DSP systems. It computes the output by multiplying a set of input samples with a set of coefficients followed by addition. Here, the multiplication and addition processess are based on the concept of Divide and Conquer approach. Separate multiplier and adder blocks are designed to model the FIR filter. The design was modeled using Verilog HDL and simulated and synthesized using Xilinx IS E 14.2. The design was also synthesized in Leonardo Spectrum. A comparison was made by implementing the design on different FPGA devices. The result shows that the proposed system has better device utilization in Virtex-5 FPGA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA synthesis of area efficient data path for reconfigurable FIR filter","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992985","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06992985.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"FPGA synthesis of area efficient data path for reconfigurable FIR filter","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992985/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825071","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA synthesis of area efficient data path for reconfigurable FIR filter","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060154S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6992985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6992987,"authors":[{"name":"Neena Baby","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Neena","lastName":"Baby","id":"37085567670"},{"name":"C Pradeep","affiliation":["Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"C","lastName":"Pradeep"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4191-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4193-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4192-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6992987","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6992987","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Transform coding","Quantization (signal)","Discrete cosine transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","Image coding","Space vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","field programmable gate arrays","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA partitioning","reconfigurable video compression module","field programmable gate arrays","space applications","weather forecasting processes","CMOS structures","video compression system","self-repairing algorithm","modern reconfigurable architectures","Verilog HDL","Xilinx IS E 14.2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Video compression","radiation","self-repair"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly considered in space applications as they are flexible and reprogrammable.

MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks based on CSMA/CA induce high overhead due to RTS/CTS packets and does not completely eliminate hidden terminal problems. A new technique, called Grid based Channel allocation and Access scheduling using Latin Squares (GAALS) can be effectively used for Channel allocation and Channel access. GAALS effectively increases the throughput and reduces end to end delay as well as jitter. Time division Multiple Access (TDMA) is used for both Channel allocation and Channel access in GAALS. In this paper, GAALS is modified to GALS, where grid based channel allocation using Latin Squares is done; but alternate techniques like Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are considered for channel access and they are compared. Performance metrics which are used for comparison include throughput and delay. Simulation result shows that CDMA is a better channel access technique as compared to all the other techniques for channel access.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6992996/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14833122","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6992996/","publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GALS with CDMA based access scheduling for Wireless Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GALS with CDMA based access scheduling for Wireless Internet of Things","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04429S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6992996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6993001,"authors":[{"name":"Teena Susan Joseph","affiliation":["VLSI and Embedded Systems, Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Teena Susan","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37085509666"},{"name":"Ajith Ravindran","affiliation":["Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Ravindran"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4191-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4193-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4192-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993001","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of non-volatile 4\u00d74 4T1D DRAM cell in 0.18\u03bcm technology","abstract":"This paper deals with the design and evolution of different 4\u00d74 bit DRAM cells.

Cloud computing is a next generation computing solution in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) which allows its users to use high speed infrastructure and services provided by Cloud Service Providers (CSP). Therefore, deployment of cloud based architecture for MSCs would aid in improving its performance and efficiency. However, cloud based solutions raises concerns over security of users' private data, since data is handled by an external party that cannot be trusted. Hence, it is necessary to incorporate necessary security measures to ensure the security of users' private data. In this thesis \u201cA Multi Server Storage Authentication System for Cloud Computing\u201d is proposed to ensure security, privacy and anonymity of user's private data. In order to achieve this, we have formulated a case involving sales data analysis of a certain organization through computing statistical parameters of sales person's private sales data on a cloud environment. Moreover, considering the results, it is conclusive that cloud platforms can be successfully deployed to improve efficiency of MSCs while ensuring the security of users' private data; which in turn provides evidence for the practicability of multi-party based cloud computing solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi server storage authentication system for cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993112","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06993112.pdf","startPage":"1034","endPage":"1038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"A multi server storage authentication system for cloud computing","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993112/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825069","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi server storage authentication system for cloud computing","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059614S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6993112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6993124,"authors":[{"name":"Biplab Panda","affiliation":["M.

One auxiliary circuit have been added to the differential amplifier in order to improve its Slew Rate. The Power Dissipation of the circuit is well controlled by the auxiliary circuit as auxiliary circuit comes into play only during large transients or slewing period and remains off during normal operation. Whenever an Operational Amplifier is driven as a voltage buffer, the output signal usually gets distorted even at very low frequencies. Thus by using the additional auxiliary circuit not only improves the Slew Rate at higher frequencies but also dissipates less power. The Operational Amplifier is designed and simulated using GPDK 90 nm CMOS technology in Cadence environment. It achieves a 40.09 dB DC gain, 31.31 V/\u03bcs Slew Rate for a load capacitor of 2 pF. A 105% improvement is achieved for slew rate.

Dynamic vehicle routing address the problem of finding the least time consumable path considering change in traffic condition dynamically in our day to day traffic. Due to the complex nature of the problem, it cannot be solved exactly using traditional algorithms e.g. shortest route finding algorithms etc. In our implementation, traffic density is calculated, which is a measure of traffic, and then most feasible route is evaluated with parameters like distance, time and traffic density. Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithms have been exploited and modified to allow the search for multiple routes and to find true or approximate solution.

It is a proven fact that improper elicitation of requirements leads to a project failure. So for the improvement in the software industry's success rate more attention is required in the elicitation process. In order to help elicitor to understand and select different methods, many frameworks are proposed that highlight the key issues of requirement elicitation but most of the frameworks are theoretical in nature. They lack practical guidance and extensive study of a wide variation of methods for requirements Elicitation. In this paper we propose a framework for requirement elicitation that support elicitor to understand and select methods for requirement elicitation and also addresses three core problem areas of requirements elicitation, pre-domain development, stakeholders management and elicitation technique selection that were identified as lacking and needed guidance and support. Finally we validate the framework of effective requirement elicitation using finite state machine. Test cases are generated for the validation of the framework. The approach for generating the test cases through FSM is very reliable and efficient and does not support for the invalid test cases. Valid input strings are generated as test cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06993145.pdf","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1216","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of requirement elicitation framework using finite state machine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Unified modeling language","Automata","Neural networks","Instruments","Algorithm design and analysis","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite state machines","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["requirement elicitation framework","finite state machine","requirement engineering","software industry","predomain development","stakeholders management","elicitation technique selection","FSM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Requirement Elicitation","Elicitor","Stakeholder","Test Cases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Validation of requirement elicitation framework using finite state machine","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993145/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825127","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of requirement elicitation framework using finite state machine","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061378S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6993145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6993147,"authors":[{"name":"Batthina Mounika","affiliation":["Dept.

This problem becomes more critical when some of the Cloud servers are under loaded and some overloaded. This necessitates an effective Load Balancing technique that can serve the purpose of not only properly utilizing the servers but also reducing the negative impact on the user services. The existing Load Balancing techniques suffer from various issues like (i) balancing the load after a server has been overloaded, (ii) constant querying the server about availability of its resources, hence, increasing computation costs and bandwidth consumption. This paper proposes an algorithm that takes a preventive approach of Load Balancing by considering only the response time of the each request. Based on the response time, the proposed method decides the allocation of next incoming request. The approach is not only dynamic in nature, but also reduces the communication and extra computation on each server. The algorithm is implemented and tested. Results prove the performance of proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06993159.pdf","startPage":"1287","endPage":"1293","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Response time based load balancing in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time factors","Servers","Cloud computing","Load management","Prediction algorithms","Bandwidth","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["response time based load balancing","cloud computing","cloud services","cloud servers","user services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Load Balancing","Response Time","Threshold","Prediction Time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Response time based load balancing in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993159/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825170","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Response time based load balancing in cloud computing","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052041S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6993159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6993160,"authors":[{"name":"Sudeep D.

It is one of the very deadly form of cancer. It occurs on the melanocytic cells of skin. So skin cancer is also known as Melanoma. Due to the malignancy feature it is also known as malignant melanoma. Melanoma causes the abnormal growth of melanocytic cells which produces the sun protective pigment melanin. Due to that reason melanoma appears as black or brown in color. Main factors that cause melanoma are over exposure to sunlight and genetic factors. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is important for maintaining vitamin D levels in the body, but too much UV can cause sunburn, premature ageing, skin and damage and ultimately skin cancer. Early detection can cure skin cancer completely. The probability of cure decreases if it is not treated at early stages. Diagnosing methods like Biopsy, SIAscopy are painful and time consuming. An economical, less time consuming, painless Computer Aided Skin Cancer detection is proposed here. This methodology uses Digital Image processing and Artificial intelligence for skin cancer detection. This methodology involves no direct contact with skin. Only the dermoscopic image is used here. The image after certain image processing techniques is subjected to segmentation. After segmentation, the unique features are extracted from the image using feature extraction techniques. The feature extraction technique used here is GLCM(Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) and RGB color feature. These features are used for classification. Artificial neural network classifier is used for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of classification, the ANN is optimized by Genetic Algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993162","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1309","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06993162.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid genetic algorithm \u2014 Artificial neural network classifier for skin cancer detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Malignant tumors","Lesions","Skin","Skin cancer","Image segmentation","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","feature extraction","genetic algorithms","image classification","image colour analysis","image segmentation","matrix algebra","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","artificial neural network classifier","skin cancer detection","malignant melanoma","melanocytic cells","sun protective pigment melanin","ultraviolet radiation","sunlight exposure","genetic factors","cure probability","biopsy","SIAscopy","computer aided skin cancer detection","digital image processing","artificial intelligence","dermoscopic image","image segmentation","feature extraction","GLCM feature","gray level co-occurrence matrix","RGB color feature","red-green-blue color","ANN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Melanoma","dermoscopic image","Gray Leval Cooccurrence Matrix","Artificial neural network","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid genetic algorithm \u2014 Artificial neural network classifier for skin cancer detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825095","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid genetic algorithm \u2014 Artificial neural network classifier for skin cancer detection","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06453S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6993162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6993186,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A practical problem is that wheeling from vendor to vendee involves power flows through several intermediate networks that is, multi-area wheeling. Each utility involves in part of a more number of wheeling transaction over a few miles or hundreds of miles. A vendor that generates power does not have to own power transmission lines: only a connection to the network or grid. The vendor then pays the owner of the transmission line based on how much power is being moved and how congested the line is. In this paper, the basic objective is to minimize the overall operating cost considering the topological structure of the multi area wheeling. This is addressed as a non-linear optimization problem with linear constraints.

Lossy image compression techniques minimize the size of the image without degrading the visual quality of the image. Previous work has proved that the hybrid wavelet transforms (HWT) are better than the respective constituent orthogonal transforms in image compression when considered in equal and varying proportions [1, 2, 3]. Here the extended performance comparison of HWT for image compression is presented with assorted color spaces, varying the constituent transforms and the proportions of the constituent transforms to test the effect on quality of image compression. The experimentation is done on set of 15 images by varying the constituent transforms, proportion of constituent transforms, compression ratios (CR) and color spaces. The constituent transforms used to generate HWT are Cosine transform, Kekre transform, Walsh transform and Haar transform. Here five proportions of constituent transforms alias 1:16, 1:4, 1:1, 4:1, 16:1 are considered for generation of HWT. Results prove that 4:1, 1:1, 1:4 proportions of constituent transforms in HWT gives better performance as compared to all other proportions of constituent transforms for different compression ratios. For 95% compression ratio, 4:1 ratio of Cosine- Haar constituent transforms in HWT with LUV color space gives better results. 1:1 ratio of Cosine-Haar constituent transforms give better results for compression ratios between 75% and 90% with RGB color space. For lower compression ratios, 1:4 proportions of Cosine-Haar constituent transforms in HWT gives better performance with RGB color space.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973086/6992918/06993197.pdf","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1508","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression using hybrid wavelet transform with varying proportions of cosine, Haar, Walsh and Kekre transforms with assorted color spaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Image coding","Image color analysis","Wavelet transforms","Hybrid power systems","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","Haar transforms","image coding","image colour analysis","Walsh functions","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","hybrid wavelet transform","HWT","cosine transform","Haar transform","Walsh transform","Kekre transform","RGB color space","constituent transforms","compression ratios","CR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid Wavelet Transform","Compression","Orthogonal Transform","Kekre transform","Cosine Transform","Walsh transform","Haar transform","Color space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using hybrid wavelet transform with varying proportions of cosine, Haar, Walsh and Kekre transforms with assorted color spaces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993197/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14825168","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using hybrid wavelet transform with varying proportions of cosine, Haar, Walsh and Kekre transforms with assorted color spaces","confLoc":"Kanyakumari, India","sourcePdf":"ICCICCT514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122001S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973086","isNumber":"6992918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973086","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6992918","articleId":"6993197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6993342,"authors":[{"name":"Monireh Haghighatjoo","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Information Technology Engineering, Islamic Azad university, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Monireh","lastName":"Haghighatjoo","id":"37085574962"},{"name":"Behrooz Masoumi","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Information Technology Engineering, Islamic Azad university, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Masoumi","id":"37401745700"},{"name":"Mohamad Reza Meybodi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Amirkabir University"],"firstName":"Mohamad Reza","lastName":"Meybodi","id":"37294717700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993342","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning automata","Proposals","Radiation detectors","Cognition","Resource management","Protocols","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning","learning automata","multi-agent systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strategic agents","multiresource negotiation","electronic commerce markets","multiagent environments","agents interaction","resource allocation","case-based reasoning","learning automata","agent negotiations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi agent system","resource allocation","negotiation","learning automata","case-based reasoning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993342","abstract":"In electronic commerce markets, agents often should acquire multiple resources to fulfill a high-level task.

In this paper, we have used NINAPRO database that contains sEMG and kinematic data of upper limbs while performing 52 hand postures and movements. We evaluated the performance of MLP classifier in comparison with LDA and LS-SVM classifiers using different combinations of features. First by windowing the signal with two different methods, the major part of the signal was selected and eight various temporal features (MAV, IAV, RMS, WL, E, ER1, ER2, CC) were extracted. Then to achieve the best performance of each classifier, they were evaluated with single, double and multiple combinations of features. For MLP classifier, the best average classification accuracy of 96.34% was achieved for first windowing method and using combination of all features. The corresponding accuracy for LDA classifier (with first windowing method and MAV (or IAV) +CC features) was 84.23%. For LS-SVM classifier (with second windowing method and IAV+MAV+RMS+WL features), the best accuracy of 85.19% was obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993343","startPage":"18","endPage":"22","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974753/6993332/06993343.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network classifier in comparison with LDA and LS-SVM classifiers to recognize 52 hand postures and movements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Accuracy","Support vector machines","Electrodes","Databases","Standards","Electromyography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","feature extraction","gesture recognition","medical signal processing","neural nets","prosthetics","signal classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network classifier","LDA classifier","LS-SVM classifier","hand posture recognition","hand movement recognition","distal limb posture classification","distal limb movement classification","surface electromyography","sEMG","proximal muscles","myoelectric hand prostheses","NINAPRO database","MLP classifier","temporal feature extraction","first windowing method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extraction of motor commands","Hand prosthesis","LDA classifier","LS-SVM classifier","MLP classifier","Surface electromyography signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network classifier in comparison with LDA and LS-SVM classifiers to recognize 52 hand postures and movements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993343/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14825287","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network classifier in comparison with LDA and LS-SVM classifiers to recognize 52 hand postures and movements","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"1563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088902S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974753","isNumber":"6993332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974753","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6993332","articleId":"6993343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6993364,"authors":[{"name":"Niloofar Afshari Abolkarlou","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology Engineering, Graguated University of Advanced Technology, Kerman, Iran"],"firstName":"Niloofar Afshari","lastName":"Abolkarlou","id":"37085491394"},{"name":"Ali Akbar Niknafs","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University, Kerman, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali Akbar","lastName":"Niknafs","id":"37595703700"},{"name":"Mohammad Kazem Ebrahimpour","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University, Kerman, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Kazem","lastName":"Ebrahimpour","id":"37085498984"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993364","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":464},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Accuracy","Measurement","Diversity reception","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ensemble imbalance classification","data preprocessing","clustering algorithm","genetic algorithm","machine learning","data mining","SMOTE","synthetic minority oversampling technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imbalanced data","ensemble imbalanced classification","layer based ensemble classification Introduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993364","abstract":"One of the most interesting and important issues in the machine learning and data mining research areas is high accuracy classification.

Two ideas were used to improve the algorithm performance. Firstly, the dictionary set was adaptively updated according to appearance changes. Secondly, using the area around the target, occlusion was diagnosed and subsequently the template set was updated. This technique prevented the occluded part of the target getting into the template set.

The pose estimation problem is defined as optimization of the 45 parameters which define body pose model and is solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The objective of this optimization is to maximize a fitness function which formulates how much body model matches with 2D marker's coordinate in video frames. In this algorithm a sampling covariance matrix is used in the first part of the velocity equation of PSO that is annealed with iterations. One of the major problems of this algorithm is the high number of parameters that define the pose of the body model. To tackle this problem, we divide the optimization into six stages that exploit the hierarchical structure of the model.

In traditional classification methods, as SVM, SAM, KNN the uniform criterion is considered for separating the classes as margin, angle, distance, etc. In classification process the distance between unlabeled pixel and a class is calculated. The minimum distance between unlabeled pixel and each class is the main criterion for labeling the pixel. In this paper a simple method based on the within class similarity is proposed for hyperspectral images classification that is proper for limited training samples problem. At first, the best specification of a class is explored based on the training samples, although this specification for each class can be different. Later, unlabeled pixel is added to the training samples of either class for recalculation of each one. Now this specification is compared with the former specification. The unlabeled pixel belongs to the class with minimum difference between former and later specification. Experimental results outcomes, based on the hyperspectral images, represent the effectiveness of this method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993375","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974753/6993332/06993375.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"774","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral image classification via within class similarity for limited training samples problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral image classification via within class similarity for limited training samples problem","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6993375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14825333","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993375/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral image classification via within class similarity for limited training samples problem","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"266IEEERevise.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055808S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974753","isNumber":"6993332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974753","xplore-issue":"6993332","articleId":"6993375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6993384,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Morteza Mirhoseninejad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan, Rafsanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Morteza","lastName":"Mirhoseninejad","id":"37085409063"},{"name":"Reza Berangi","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Berangi","id":"37348389100"},{"name":"Mahmood Fathy","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Fathy","id":"37266676300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993384","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Media Access Protocol","Bandwidth","Dynamic spectrum access","Channel capacity","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","mathematical analysis","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical analysis","CCC saturation capacity","CCC problem","frequency bands","wireless applications","mobile applications","common control channel mechanism","ad hoc networks","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive spectrum access","cognitive radio networks","saturation capacity","Common Control Channel","Medium access control"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving saturation capacity through verification of common control channel mechanism in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993332","endPage":"518","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974753/6993332/06993384.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993384","startPage":"515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993384","abstract":"Increasing number of mobile and wireless applications is threatened by the scarcity of frequency bands.

In June 2013 American National Security Agency (NSA) proposed a new block cipher family named Simon and declared that the aim of Simon design is to fill the gap for secure, flexible, and analyzable and to perform exceptionally well across the full spectrum of lightweight applications.

We have to maximize the throughput of secondary users under total power budget along with the detection performance constraints. Based on the standard optimization techniques, the optimal conditions are obtained and a closed-form equation is expressed to determine the priority of PUs for assigning the sensing nodes to them.

Developing effective solutions for their queries are very important. The success of cloud computing systems fundamentally relies on the efficient use of resources. Discovering and managing resources is one important step in the system effecting. In this paper, a method of Agent-based resource discovery using Bloom filter is proposed. In this strategy, resources information are stored in a Bloom filter, and then, the Bloom filter is sent to the related broker agent and broker agent sends it to the related database. In addition, users make their requests using their hash values and send them to related broker agent. The information needed for search and discovery is stored inside the Bloom filters and then the achieved Bloom filter is transferred, therefore, the amount data transmitted is reduced significantly. The results show that, in the proposed approach, the number of transferred bits in the network for user's requests, the number of transferred bits in the network for resources information, and the average of consumed time to search and discovery requested resources, approximately are 5 times, 15 times, and 3 times less than the case without using Bloom filter, respectively. The consumed memory, used bandwidth in the network, the time of search and discovery of resources, have improved significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993399","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974753/6993332/06993399.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993332","startPage":"352","endPage":"357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agent-based resource discovery in cloud computing using bloom filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Agent-based resource discovery in cloud computing using bloom filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993399/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14825285","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6993399/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agent-based resource discovery in cloud computing using bloom filters","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"3332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043627S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974753","isNumber":"6993332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974753","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6993332","articleId":"6993399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6993402,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Bagher Bahador","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Bagher","lastName":"Bahador","id":"37085507529"},{"name":"Mahdi Abadi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Abadi","id":"37863276700"},{"name":"Asghar Tajoddin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Asghar","lastName":"Tajoddin","id":"38094581400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993402","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Malware","Hardware","Vectors","Support vector machines","Matrix decomposition","Radiation detectors","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invasive software","program diagnostics","singular value decomposition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioral malware detection","hardware performance counters","singular value decomposition","malicious programs","code obfuscation techniques","static analysis","signature-based detection","behavioral detection techniques","system call traces","HPCMalHunter","real-time behavioral malware detection","SVD","behavioral vector","support vector machines","SVM","feature vectors","false alarm rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["behavioral malware detection","hardware-level detection","real-time detection","hardware performance counter","singular value decomposition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993402","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974753/6993332/06993402.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HPCMalHunter: Behavioral malware detection using hardware performance counters and singular value decomposition","abstract":"Malicious programs, also known as malware, often use code obfuscation techniques to make static analysis more difficult and to evade signature-based detection. To resolve this problem, various behavioral detection techniques have been proposed that focus on the run-time behaviors of programs in order to dynamically detect malicious ones. Most of these techniques describe the run-time behavior of a program on the basis of its data flow and/or its system call traces. Recent work in behavioral malware detection has shown promise in using hardware performance counters (HPCs), which are a set of special-purpose registers built into modern processors providing detailed information about hardware and software events. In this paper, we pursue this line of research by presenting HPCMalHunter, a novel approach for real-time behavioral malware detection. HPCMalHunter uses HPCs to collect a set of event vectors from the beginning of a program's execution. It also uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce these event vectors and generate a behavioral vector for the program. By applying support vector machines (SVMs) to the feature vectors of different programs, it is able to identify malicious programs in real-time. Our results of experiments show that HPCMalHunter can detect malicious programs at the beginning of their execution with a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14825300","htmlLink":"/document/6993402/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HPCMalHunter: Behavioral malware detection using hardware performance counters and singular value decomposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HPCMalHunter: Behavioral malware detection using hardware performance counters and singular value decomposition","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"3423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097538S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974753","isNumber":"6993332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974753","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6993332","articleId":"6993402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6993409,"authors":[{"name":"Shadi Mahmoudi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kurdistan, Kurdistan, Iran"],"firstName":"Shadi","lastName":"Mahmoudi","id":"37085528547"},{"name":"Parham Moradi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kurdistan, Kurdistan, Iran"],"firstName":"Parham","lastName":"Moradi","id":"37393504200"},{"name":"Fardin Akhlaghian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kurdistan, Kurdistan, Iran"],"firstName":"Fardin","lastName":"Akhlaghian","id":"37393508100"},{"name":"Rizan Moradi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Rizan","lastName":"Moradi","id":"37085360051"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993409","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"The imbalance data problem in classification is a significant research area and has attracted a lot attention in recent years. Rebalancing class distribution techniques such as over-sampling or under-sampling are the most common approaches to deal with this problem. This paper presents a new method so called Diversity and Separable Metrics in Over-Sampling Technique (DSMOTE) to handle the imbalanced learning problems. The main idea of the DSMOTE is to use a diversity and separable measure which shows a positive impact on the minority class. This improvement is achieved by reduce overfitting by using a diversity measure. Moreover by using the separable measure the risk of generating new samples in decision boundaries with hard-to-learn samples is decreased. The proposed method improves the learning accuracy in three stages including; (1) removal of abnormal samples from minority class, (2) selecting the top three samples of minority class according to desired criteria and (3) generating new sample using selected samples. The experiments are conducted on five real world datasets which is taken from Iran University of Medical Science and also six different UCI datasets. Moreover, three different classifiers, four resampling algorithms and six performance evaluation measures are used to evaluate the proposed method. The reported results indicate that the proposed approach demonstrates a better or at least comparable performance compared to those of the state-of-the-art methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

The problem though is that this process is often time consuming, costly and achieving an optimal policy might be rather slow. One way to alleviate this problem is qualitative learning by providing some initial knowledge from the environment for the agent. In this paper, a new algorithm has been introduced based on qualitative learning that aggregates states after some early episodes of learning. The learning then continues on the new qualitative environment. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, experiments on two benchmark environments have been conducted. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm in accelerating the learning process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6993424/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14825321","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Qualitative reinforcement learning to accelerate finding an optimal policy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Qualitative reinforcement learning to accelerate finding an optimal policy","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"3882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055096S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974753","isNumber":"6993332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974753","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6993332","articleId":"6993424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6993451,"authors":[{"name":"Behrouz Ahadzadeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Information Technology Engineering, Qazvin Branch Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Behrouz","lastName":"Ahadzadeh","id":"37085390690"},{"name":"Mohammad Bagher Menhaj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amir Kabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran","Faculty of Computer and Information Technology Engineering, Qazvin Branch Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Bagher","lastName":"Menhaj","id":"37300101200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993451","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Classification algorithms","Neural networks","Accuracy","Vectors","Optimization","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","evolutionary computation","feedforward neural nets","gradient methods","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified differential evolution algorithm","classification problems","artificial neural network training algorithm","pattern recognition","data mining","medical diagnosis","gradient descent based algorithms","back propagation algorithm","gradient based methods","evolutionary algorithms","2sDE","feedforward neural networks","local optimization training algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural networks","training algorithms","differential evolution algorithm","classification problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993451","abstract":"In recent years, progress in the field of artificial neural networks provides a very important tool for complex problems in pattern recognition, data mining and medical diagnosis. The training algorithms of neural networks play an important role for adjustment the network parameters. Different algorithms have been presented for training neural networks; the most common one is the use of gradient descent based algorithms such as back propagation algorithm. Getting trapped in local minima and possessing a very slow converging speed made the gradient based methods problematic. To resolve this many evolutionary algorithms have been adopted for the training of neural networks. In this paper, a modified differential evolution algorithm acronymed as 2sDE is employed as a new training algorithm for feedforward neural networks in order to resolve the problems of local optimization training algorithms such as trapping in local minima and the slow convergence. Effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are compared with other training algorithms on various classification problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993451","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974753/6993332/06993451.pdf","startPage":"598","endPage":"603","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training neural networks using modified differential evolution algorithm for classification problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Training neural networks using modified differential evolution algorithm for classification problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14825353","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6993451/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training neural networks using modified differential evolution algorithm for classification problems","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"4533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068967S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974753","isNumber":"6993332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974753","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6993332","articleId":"6993451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6993452,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Mehdi Mirzaei","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohamad Mehdi","lastName":"Mirzaei","id":"37089145145"},{"name":"Kiarash Mizanian","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Kiarash","lastName":"Mizanian","id":"37841297500"},{"name":"Mehdi Rezaeian","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Rezaeian","id":"37085354722"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993452","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"abstract":"Self-similarity is a phenomenon which has come into computer networks literatures during last two decades and plays a significant role in modeling of computer network traffics. It is generally accepted that computer network traffics are self-similar and they are dissimilar to Poisson-based traffics. Computer network models exert a considerable influence on improving quality of service. Therefore, self-similarity should be considered in traffic models in order to acquire more appropriate QoS. In this paper, we propose a novel model for generating self-similar traffic. Our model includes a multi-layer perceptron neural network and a random error generator. This model has two phases: Firstly, the model is trained with real network traffic. Secondly, with the assistance of the random error generator, it generates traffic which is as self-similar as the real traffic. The implementation and the results validate this model through drawing a comparison between the Hurst parameter of the generated traffic and the real traffic.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Telecommunication traffic","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Training","Generators","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","error statistics","multilayer perceptrons","quality of service","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-similar network traffic","artificial neural networks","self-similarity","computer networks literature","computer network traffic","Poisson-based traffic","computer network model","quality of service","traffic model","QoS","multilayer perceptron neural network","random error generator","real network traffic","Hurst parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-Similarity","Network Traffic Modeling","Hurst Parameter","Long-range Dependency","Heavy-tailed Distribution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993452","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6974753/6993332/06993452.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of self-similar network traffic using artificial neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of self-similar network traffic using artificial neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993452/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993452/","accessionNumber":"14825290","conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of self-similar network traffic using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"4542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099713S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6974753","isNumber":"6993332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6974753","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6993332","articleId":"6993452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6993455,"authors":[{"name":"Masoumeh Rezaei Jam","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Engineering University of Tabriz Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoumeh Rezaei","lastName":"Jam"},{"name":"Leili Mohammad Khanli","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Leili Mohammad","lastName":"Khanli","id":"37391623600"},{"name":"Morteza Sargolzaei Javan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and IT, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, IRAN"],"firstName":"Morteza Sargolzaei","lastName":"Javan","id":"38488362100"},{"name":"Mohammad Kazem Akbari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and IT, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, IRAN"],"firstName":"Mohammad Kazem","lastName":"Akbari","id":"37270215900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5487-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5486-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6993455","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Encryption","Servers","Authorization","Ciphers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","public domain software","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hadoop security","trusted computing","open-source cloud computing","big data framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Trust","Hadoop","BigData","MapReduce","Cloud Computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6993455","abstract":"Trusted computing and security of services is one of the most challenging topics today and is the cloud computing's core technology that is currently the focus of international IT universe.

Virtualization is the main technique to empower cloud computing by separating compute environments from the actual physical infrastructure and creating virtual machines (VMs). Mapping of these virtual machines to the physical servers is called virtual machine placement problem and known to be NP hard. On the other hand, the grouping genetic algorithm which generally used for this problem does not perform efficiently in many cases. In the current work, we improve this algorithm by introducing a unique and efficient method for encoding and generating new solutions. Using vector packing problem, we model the problem of virtual machine placement and try to reduce power consumption by minimizing the number of used servers and also maximizing resource usage efficiency.

Shortage of frequency resource is a limited factor for the evolution of wireless network, although some frequency around 230MHz are indicated to electric wireless networks, it can't meet all the needs of existing services, spectrum scarcity weaken the performance of the electric wireless communication system. Cognitive radio (CR) can exploit the unused portions of spectrum for authorized users in an opportunistic manner by spectrum sensing which will improve the efficiency of spectrum. Combined with the development status and characteristics of electric wireless communication system, we present the system architecture of electric cognitive radio network (E-CRN) which can take full advantage of the idle frequency resources and solve the problem of frequency scarcity. Spectrum assignment is a key technology of CR, the results of assignment will affect the spectral efficiency and fairness directly. Comprehensive consideration of spectrum efficiency and fairness, method of spectrum assignment for electric cognitive radio network (E-CRN) is presented, which not only give the three decision factors of fairness and calculation method, but also define a new spectrum assignment criteria by interaction participation between cognitive base station and cognitive users. The result obtained from numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm effectively improve the spectrum utilization with a fair distribution and will satisfy more requirements of wireless services for Smart Grid.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2014.6993538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2014.6993538","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1729","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975316/6993479/06993538.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Power System Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6993479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on spectrum assignment in electric cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Research on spectrum assignment in electric cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6993538/","accessionNumber":"14826114","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6993538/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on spectrum assignment in electric cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"CP0866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042627S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975316","isNumber":"6993479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975316","xplore-issue":"6993479","articleId":"6993538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6993648,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Zhao","affiliation":["the North China Electric Power University, Baoding, CO, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaojun Zhao was born in China in 1983.

The recently discovered security attacks like W32.Stuxnet and the Duqu worm changed this almost established belief. Further, usual methods of anomaly detection cannot simply be employed in embedded systems since they are usually resource-constrained and the detection methods might interfere with performance of the main system tasks. However, behavior of applications running in embedded systems is relatively known, and profiling the correct behavior and comparing it with the runtime behavior is accounted as an effective approach for anomaly detection with no such interferences. In this paper, we consider the inter-effects of processor temperature and power consumption of embedded systems, and present a novel technique to detect malicious activities with minor delays with respect to the occurrences. This is done through analyzing the simultaneously observed power and temperature of the processor. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by using the power and temperature traces of a real processor obtained through detailed simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994033","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975720/6994006/06994033.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994006","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in embedded systems using simultaneous power and temperature monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in embedded systems using simultaneous power and temperature monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994033/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826249","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6994033/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in embedded systems using simultaneous power and temperature monitoring","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"1583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119924S","chronDate":"3-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975720","isNumber":"6994006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975720","xplore-issue":"6994006","articleId":"6994033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6994225,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085414274"},{"name":"Chung-Yi Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Yi","lastName":"Li","id":"37714377700"},{"name":"Hai-Han Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hai-Han","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274984900"},{"name":"Ching-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Hung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37402710100"},{"name":"Peng-Chun Peng","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Peng-Chun","lastName":"Peng","id":"37275194800"},{"name":"Chia-Rung Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Rung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085414275"},{"name":"Jian-Hua Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jian-Hua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085384299"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6994225","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"This letter proposes and experimentally demonstrates a hybrid cable television (CATV)/16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in-house network over a combined 40 km single-mode fiber, 1.43 km photonic crystal fiber, and 30 m graded index-plastic optical fiber/5 m visible light communication transport.

It employs a picture-based prediction scheme to estimate the number of interpolation filter calls at run-time by monitoring the group of pictures history based on video coding structure knowledge. Reconfigurable acceleration engines are developed that can adapt to different filter types. Dynamic composition of different instances of these engines enables different implementation versions with area versus throughput tradeoff. A run-time selection scheme determines the best implementation version for each picture based on the throughput requirements. Compared to state-of-the-art, our architecture reduces resource usage by 57% while supporting various throughputs and video resolutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994230/","volume":"34","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6994230/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14854512","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Hardware Architecture for Fractional Pixel Interpolation in High Efficiency Video Coding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation as part of the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre \u201cInvasive Computing\u201d","grantNumber":"SFB/TR 89"},{"fundingName":"Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Hardware Architecture for Fractional Pixel Interpolation in High Efficiency Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcad-shafique-2384517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11646S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7012128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7012128","articleId":"6994230","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6994239,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqing Zhai","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Huiqing","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37540036000"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37657590100"},{"name":"Yiping Zang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yiping","lastName":"Zang","id":"37085454224"},{"name":"Qiqiang Gao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qiqiang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085460638"},{"name":"Changhong Liang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Changhong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085341178"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6994239","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3715},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO","Dipole antennas","Antenna arrays","Broadband antennas","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antennas","electromagnetic wave polarisation","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","microstrip antennas","MIMO communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE base station magnetoelectric dipole antenna","anti-interference characteristics","multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO system application","wideband long term evolution base station antenna","flexible band-notch characteristics","radiation patches","impedance bandwidth","wideband antenna","wireless local area network narrow communication band","bandwidth 2.39 GHz to 2.52 GHz","bandwidth 1.825 GHz to 2.925 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-interference characteristics","base-station antenna multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) system","long-term evolution (LTE)","wireless local area network (WLAN)"]}],"abstract":"In this research, a wideband long-term evolution (LTE) base-station antenna with flexible band-notch characteristics is introduced by two window-type slots etched on radiation patches of the magnetoelectric dipole.

Both the clipping ratio optimization in suppressing the peak-to-average ratio of the OFDM signals and the output power equalization function of the OD-PE regardless of input power level reduce the impact of quantization errors in analogue-to-digital conversion (ADC) needed for digital signal processing (DSP)-based OFDM signal demodulation, which greatly improves the receiver's dynamic range. Successful reception of 10-Gb/s time division multiplexing-based DCO-OFDM signals with wide dynamic range of 13.5 dB is experimentally demonstrated even for a 5-bit resolution ADC, which is typically used for real-time DSPs. Numerical calculations also support the measured results.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2375955","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7054625/06994245.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2375955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7054625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide Dynamic Range Reception of TDM-Based DCO-OFDM Signals Using Optical Domain Power Equalization and Symmetrical Clipping Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15, 15 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994245/","displayDocTitle":"Wide Dynamic Range Reception of TDM-Based DCO-OFDM Signals Using Optical Domain Power Equalization and Symmetrical Clipping Techniques","volume":"33","issue":"8","publicationDate":"15 April15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14982541","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994245/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide Dynamic Range Reception of TDM-Based DCO-OFDM Signals Using Optical Domain Power Equalization and Symmetrical Clipping Techniques","sourcePdf":"jlt-koma-2375955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076769S","chronDate":"April15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7054625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","xplore-issue":"7054625","articleId":"6994245","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994250,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Tassi","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7055202/6994250/tassi-2384231-small.gif","p":["\nAndrea Tassi received the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication systems and \ntelematics from the University of Florence, Florence, Italy, in 2014.

Multirate transmission strategies have been proposed as a means of delivering layered services to users experiencing different downlink channel conditions. In this paper, we consider point-to-multipoint layered service delivery across a generic cellular system and improve it by applying different random linear network coding approaches. We derive packet error probability expressions and use them as performance metrics in the formulation of resource-allocation frameworks. The aim of these frameworks is both the optimization of the transmission scheme and the minimization of the number of broadcast packets on each downlink channel, while offering service guarantees to a predetermined fraction of users. As a case of study, our proposed frameworks are then adapted to the LTE-A standard and the eMBMS technology. We focus on the delivery of a video service based on the H.264/SVC standard and demonstrate the advantages of layered network coding over multirate transmission. Furthermore, we establish that the choice of both the network coding technique and the resource-allocation method play a critical role on the network footprint, as well as the quality of each received video layer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource-Allocation Frameworks for Network-Coded Layered Multimedia Multicast Services","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384231","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7055202/06994250.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.2384231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Resource-Allocation Frameworks for Network-Coded Layered Multimedia Multicast Services","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6994250/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14981345","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/L006251/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Resource-Allocation Frameworks for Network-Coded Layered Multimedia Multicast Services","sourcePdf":"jsac-tassi-2384231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136341S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7055202","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7055202","articleId":"6994250","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994254,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando A.

The tradeoff is obtained by examining the influence of the bias conditions of the modulator on the transmitted single side band signal. The frequency components in the electric field and the associated photocurrent at the output of the IQ modulator are derived mathematically. For any frequency plan, the optimum bias point can be identified by calculating the sensitivity gain for every subchannel. A setup composed of subcarriers located at multiples of the data rate ensures that the effects of intermodulation distortion are studied in the most suitable conditions. Experimental tests with up to five QPSK electrical subchannels are performed to verify the mathematical model and validate the predicted gains in sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2384838","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6987389/06994254.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2384838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987389","startPage":"258","endPage":"266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Bias Point in Broadband Subcarrier Multiplexing With Optical IQ Modulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Bias Point in Broadband Subcarrier Multiplexing With Optical IQ Modulators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"14861906","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6994254/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EI CFTD","grantNumber":"CF/2011/1627"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"SFI","grantNumber":"09/IN.1/12653 and 10/CE/I1853"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L000091/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Bias Point in Broadband Subcarrier Multiplexing With Optical IQ Modulators","sourcePdf":"jlt-gutierrez-2384838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098865S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6987389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6987389","articleId":"6994254","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994257,"authors":[{"name":"Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/7046465/6994257/maram-2384518-small.gif","p":["Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar (SM\u201998) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India.","He is the NXP (Philips) Chair Professor with the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi), New Delhi, India, established at IIT Delhi by Philips Semiconductors, The Netherlands (currently, NXP Semiconductors India Pvt.

Unlike most previous approaches on saturated systems, which assumed affine nonlinear systems, in this paper, tracking control problem is solved for uncertain nonaffine nonlinear systems with input saturation. To deal with the saturation constraint, an auxiliary system is constructed and a modified tracking error is defined. Then, by employing implicit function theorem, mean value theorem, and modified tracking error, updating rules are derived based on the well-known back-propagation (BP) algorithm, which has been proven to be the most relevant updating rule to control problems. However, most of the previous approaches on BP algorithm suffer from lack of stability analysis. By injecting a damping term to the standard BP algorithm, uniformly ultimately boundedness of all the signals of the closed-loop system is ensured via Lyapunov's direct method. Furthermore, the presented approach employs nonlinear in parameter neural networks. Hence, the proposed scheme is applicable to systems with higher degrees of nonlinearity. Using a high-gain observer to reconstruct the states of the system, an output feedback controller is also presented. Finally, the simulation results performed on a Duffing-Holmes chaotic system, a generalized pendulum-type system, and a numerical system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested state and output feedback control schemes.","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7287875/06994268.pdf","startPage":"2311","endPage":"2322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2378991","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2378991","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994268","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Artificial neural networks","Approximation methods","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","backpropagation","closed loop systems","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","observers","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","uncertain nonaffine nonlinear systems","input saturation","neural networks","tracking control methodology","input saturation constraint","external disturbances","auxiliary system","modified tracking error","implicit function theorem","mean value theorem","updating rules","back-propagation algorithm","damping term","standard BP algorithm","uniformly ultimately boundedness","closed-loop system","Lyapunov direct method","nonlinearity degrees","high-gain observer","state reconstruction","output feedback controller","Duffing-Holmes chaotic system","generalized pendulum-type system","numerical system","state feedback control scheme","output feedback control scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","back-propagation (BP) algorithm","input constraints","neural networks (NNs)","nonaffine nonlinear systems."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adaptation, Physiological","Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Humans","Learning","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Uncertainty"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive control","back-propagation (BP) algorithm","input constraints","neural networks (NNs)","nonaffine nonlinear systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control of Uncertain Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems With Input Saturation Using Neural Networks","accessionNumber":"15488913","pubMedId":"25532213","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6994268/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control of Uncertain Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems With Input Saturation Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnnls-esfandiari-2378991-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090304S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7287875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7287875","articleId":"6994268","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6994284,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Kusy","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rzesz\u00f3w University of Technology, Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6994284/kusy-2376703-small.gif","p":["Maciej Kusy received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Rzesz\u00f3w University of Technology, Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in biocybernetics and biomedical engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland, in 2008.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rzesz\u00f3w University of Technology.

Demand response of consumers with respect to the retail price is characterized by a Stackelberg game in the first stage, thus the first stage has two levels. A risk-aversive energy dispatch accounting for market price uncertainty is modeled by a linear robust optimization with objective uncertainty in the second stage. The proposed model is transformed to a mixed integer linear program (MILP) by jointly using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, the disjunctive constraints, and the duality theory. We propose a heuristic method to select the parameter in disjunctive constraints based on the interpretation of Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, we suggest solving an additional linear program (LP) to acquire a possible enhanced bidding strategy that guarantees a Pareto improvement on the retailer's profit over the entire uncertainty set.

for suppressing resonances in an ac power-electronics-based power system. The added series filter capacitor helps to withstand most of the system voltage, hence, allowing a lower rated converter to be used for implementing the active damper. Unlike an active power filter for mitigating low-frequency harmonics, the proposed damper dampens resonances at higher frequencies, whose values are dependent on interactions among multiple grid-connected converters and reactive elements of the system. Its control requirements are, therefore, different, particularly in the low-frequency range, where the series LC filter is predominantly capacitive, rather than the usual inductive characteristics that exist between voltage-source converters and the grid (or load). This low-frequency challenge can fortunately be resolved by the proposed fourth-order resonant controller, in addition to the second-order resonant controller used for resonance damping. Experimental results obtained have confirmed the effectiveness of these controllers, and hence, the feasibility of the active damper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2382477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7055206/06994287.pdf","startPage":"4037","endPage":"4041","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2382477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Series-<i>LC</i>-Filtered Active Damper With Grid Disturbance Rejection for AC Power-Electronics-Based Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Series-<i>LC</i>-Filtered Active Damper With Grid Disturbance Rejection for AC Power-Electronics-Based Power Systems","volume":"30","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6994287/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"14981414","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC)","grantNumber":"321149-Harmony"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Series-<italic>LC</italic>-Filtered Active Damper With Grid Disturbance Rejection for AC Power-Electronics-Based Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2382477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06861S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7055206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7055206","articleId":"6994287","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6994289,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6994289/jiang-2384495-small.gif","p":["\n\nHong Jiang (M'12) received the B.S. degree in radio technology from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1989; the M.S. degree in communication and electronic systems from Jilin University of Technology, Changchun, China, in 1996; and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Jilin University, Changchun, in 2005.","From April 2011 to May 2012, she was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

The joint estimation algorithm is based on the canonical correlation decomposition (CCD) and exploits the shift-invariance properties in the Kronecker product structure of each column of the various steering matrices. The estimated DOA and DOD can be automatically paired correspondingly. In addition, the formulas of stochastic Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds (CRB) for DOD and DOA estimation are derived. Simulations show that our method can effectively improve the performance of estimation in unknown correlated noise environments and is insensitive to having different noise environments in the two subarrays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint DOD and DOA Estimation for Bistatic MIMO Radar in Unknown Correlated Noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2384495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06994289.pdf","startPage":"5113","endPage":"5125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2384495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint DOD and DOA Estimation for Bistatic MIMO Radar in Unknown Correlated Noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6994289/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587076","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61071140 and 61371158"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint DOD and DOA Estimation for Bistatic MIMO Radar in Unknown Correlated Noise","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2384495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153799S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6994289","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6994292,"authors":[{"name":"Ramon Granell","affiliation":["Oxford e-Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Granell","id":"38542631100"},{"name":"Colin J.

With the advent of high-resolution time-series power demand data through advanced metering, mining this data could be costly from the computational viewpoint. One of the popular techniques is clustering, but depending on the algorithm the resolution of the data can have an important influence on the resulting clusters. This paper shows how temporal resolution of power demand profiles affects the quality of the clustering process, the consistency of cluster membership (profiles exhibiting similar behavior), and the efficiency of the clustering process. This work uses both raw data from household consumption data and synthetic profiles. The motivation for this work is to improve the clustering of electricity load profiles to help distinguish user types for tariff design and switching, fault and fraud detection, demand-side management, and energy efficiency measures. The key criterion for mining very large data sets is how little information needs to be used to get a reliable result, while maintaining privacy and security.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2377213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2377213","startPage":"3217","endPage":"3224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7175086/06994292.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of Raw Data Temporal Resolution Using Selected Clustering Methods on Residential Electricity Load Profiles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of Raw Data Temporal Resolution Using Selected Clustering Methods on Residential Electricity Load Profiles","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","volume":"30","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15364611","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994292/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/I000194/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Impacts of Raw Data Temporal Resolution Using Selected Clustering Methods on Residential Electricity Load Profiles","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-axon-2377213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055855S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","isNumber":"7175086","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"67","articleId":"6994292","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6994295,"authors":[{"name":"Doris S\u00e1ez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"p":["Doris S\u00e1ez (M\u201994\u2013SM\u201906) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile, in 1995 and 2000, respectively.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago.

The model is demonstrated using solar and wind generation and local load data from a real microgrid in Huatacondo, Chile, for one-day ahead forecasts to obtain the expected values together with fuzzy prediction intervals to represent future measurement bounds with a certain coverage probability. The proposed prediction interval models would help to enable the development of robust microgrid EMS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7042857/06994295.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2377178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2377178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042857","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Prediction Interval Models for Forecasting Renewable Resources and Loads in Microgrids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Predictive models","Microgrids","Energy management","Load modeling","Wind forecasting","Wind power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","energy management systems","fuzzy set theory","load forecasting","power generation dispatch","probability","solar power stations","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy prediction interval model","renewable resource forecasting system","microgrid","energy management system","EMS","generation unit dispatching","wind generation","Huatacondo Chile","one-day ahead forecasting","probability","solar generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy management system (EMS)","forecasting","fuzzy modeling","microgrid","prediction intervals","renewable"]},{"kwd":["Energy management system (EMS)","forecasting","fuzzy modeling","microgrid","prediction intervals","renewable"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Prediction Interval Models for Forecasting Renewable Resources and Loads in Microgrids","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6994295/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14945572","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Millennium Institute Complex Engineering Systems","grantNumber":"ICM: P-05-004-F and CONICYT: FBO16"},{"fundingName":"National Fund for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"1140775"},{"fundingName":"CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Prediction Interval Models for Forecasting Renewable Resources and Loads in Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-saez-2377178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059177S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7042857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"7042857","articleId":"6994295","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994298,"authors":[{"name":"Wessam Afifi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6994298/afifi-2382124-small.gif","p":["\nWessam Afifi (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering \nfrom Alexandria University, Egypt, in 2009 and the M.Sc. degree in Communications and Information Technology from the \nWireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Egypt, in 2011.

This enables them to operate in either simultaneous transmit-and-sense (TS) or simultaneous transmit-and-receive (TR) modes, with the goal of achieving improved primary user (PU) detection and/or higher SU throughput. We first consider an overlay OSA setup, and we study the TS and TR modes. We also explore the spectrum awareness/efficiency tradeoff and determine an efficient adaptive strategy for the SU link. We then consider a spectrum underlay model, with the objective of optimizing SUs' transmission powers so as to maximize the sum-throughput of $K$ FD secondary links subject to a PU outage constraint. Operating in an FD fashion is not always efficient for SUs. Hence, we propose an optimal policy for switching between FD and half-duplex. The criteria for this policy depend mainly on the SIS capabilities of SUs. Finally, we propose a mode selection algorithm for the switching process. Numerical results indicate that operating in the TS mode can reduce the PU outage probability by up to 100% compared with the classical listen-before-talk scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2382124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2382124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06994298.pdf","startPage":"2180","endPage":"2191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating self-interference suppression for full-duplex operation in opportunistic spectrum access systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating self-interference suppression for full-duplex operation in opportunistic spectrum access systems","volume":"14","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994298/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039140","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994298/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"IIP-1265960 and IIP-1432880"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-13-1-0302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating self-interference suppression for full-duplex operation in opportunistic spectrum access systems","sourcePdf":"twc-afifi-2382124-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106331S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6994298","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6994300,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Yong Um","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea","System IC Division, SK Hynix, Seongnam, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7010857/6994300/6994300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ji-Yong Um received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Kyungbuk, Korea, in 2006, 2008 and 2013, respectively","Currently, he is with the System IC Division, SK Hynix, Seongnam, Korea.

The chip retrieved successfully two B-mode phantom images with a steering angle from -45\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n to +45\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n, the maximum delay range of 8 \u03bcs, and the delay resolution of 6.25 ns. An analog-digital hybrid BF (HBF) is chosen for the proposed chip to utilize the easy beamforming operation in the digital domain and also to reduce chip area by minimizing the number of ADCs. The chip consists of eight analog beamformers (ABF) for the 1st-stage and a digital beamformer (DBF) for the 2nd-stage. The two-stage architecture reduces the memory area of both ABF and DBF by around four times.

In this paper, the HN is modeled as a layer of closed-access LTE femtocells (FCs) overlaid upon an LTE radio access network. Within the context of dynamic learning games, this work proposes a novel heterogeneous multiobjective fully distributed strategy based on a reinforcement learning (RL) model (CODIPAS-HRL) for FC self-configuration/optimization. The self-organization capability enables the FCs to autonomously and opportunistically sense the radio environment using different learning strategies and tune their parameters accordingly, in order to operate under restrictions of avoiding interference to both network tiers and satisfy certain quality-of-service requirements. The proposed model reduces the learning cost associated with each learning strategy. We also study the convergence behavior under different learning rates and derive a new accuracy metric in order to provide comparisons between the different learning strategies. The simulation results show the convergence of the learning model to a solution concept based on satisfaction equilibrium, under the uncertainty of the HN environment. We show that intra/inter-tier interference can be significantly reduced, thus resulting in higher cell throughputs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2384510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06994301.pdf","startPage":"2294","endPage":"2308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2384510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Heterogeneous Learning Games for Opportunistic Access in LTE-Based Macro/Femtocell Deployments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Heterogeneous Learning Games for Opportunistic Access in LTE-Based Macro/Femtocell Deployments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994301/","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15039159","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994301/","volume":"14","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European-Union-funded projects OneFIT (www.ict-onefit.eu) and ACROPOLIS (www.ict-acropolis.eu)"},{"fundingName":"European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7)"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC-funded India\u2013UK Advance Technology Centre (IU-ATC)","grantNumber":"EP/G054886/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Heterogeneous Learning Games for Opportunistic Access in LTE-Based Macro/Femtocell Deployments","sourcePdf":"twc-alnwaimi-2384510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091367S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6994301","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":6994302,"authors":[{"name":"Brecht Fran\u00e7ois","affiliation":["Microelectronics and Sensors division (MICAS), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7029725/6994302/6994302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brecht Fran\u00e7ois (S'08) was born in Kortrijk, Belgium, in 1984.

To improve the linearity, several harmonic traps are introduced to minimize the second- and third-order harmonics, and hence, the third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3). The impact on the linearity of the RF PA of each of the harmonic controls is studied and simulated. Finally, both the linearity of a standalone RF PA and an RF PA with proposed linearity enhancement circuitry is investigated by comparing their measured IMD3. For an LTE uplink signal with 20-MHz signal bandwidth and a 64-QAM 8.7-dB peak-to-average power ratio, the RF PA achieves 21.7% power-added efficiency (PAE) with 11-dB gain while delivering an average output power of 22.4 dBm in LTE-band VII. Simultaneously, the RF PA obeys the stringent spectral mask and the -30-dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio linearity requirement and achieves an error vector magnitude of only 4.05%. The linearized wideband RF PA is also verified for LTE-band I and achieves similar performance from 1.9 to 2.8 GHz. Thanks to the applied linearization technique, the proposed RF PA is able to transmit an LTE-advanced (release 12) signal with a carrier-aggregated bandwidth up to 60 MHz while satisfying the linearity requirements. For a 40-MHz (2 \u00d7 20 MHz) and 60-MHz (3 \u00d7 20 MHz) LTE-advanced signal at band VII, the RF PA produces an average output power of 19.2 and 17.6 dBm while achieving a PAE of 17.2% and 13.7%, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7029725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2380319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7029725/06994302.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"658","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2380319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Linear Fully Integrated Wideband RF PA for LTE-Advanced in 180-nm SOI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Highly Linear Fully Integrated Wideband RF PA for LTE-Advanced in 180-nm SOI","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6994302/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14903333","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Linear Fully Integrated Wideband RF PA for LTE-Advanced in 180-nm SOI","sourcePdf":"tmtt-francois-2380319-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138456S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7029725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7029725","articleId":"6994302","onlineDate":"19 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6994304,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7086423/6994304/ahmad-2374613-small.gif","p":["Hamed Ahmadi (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms - with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security, and dependability - as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2014.2371999","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/6994307/06994333.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2014.2371999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994333","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994333/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14820214","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994333/","volume":"103","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey","sourcePdf":"jproc-kreutz-2371999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.585304S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6994307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2368","xplore-issue":"6994307","articleId":"6994333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6994418,"authors":[{"name":"Shusuke Narieda","affiliation":["Dept. of Elec. and Comp.

Both a MIMO-supported access point (AP) and a spatial-diversity-supported AP were separately employed in the experiments. Throughput measurements were carried out with wireless users at different locations in a typical office environment. The results indicate that MIMO signals can maintain high throughput when the fiber length difference between the two remote antenna units (RAUs) is under 100 m and falls quickly when the length difference is greater. For the spatial diversity signals, high throughput can be maintained even when the difference is 150m.","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2014.6994478","publicationTitle":"Microwave Photonics (MWP) and the 2014 9th Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference (APMP) 2014 International Topical Meeting on","displayPublicationTitle":"Microwave Photonics (MWP) and the 2014 9th Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference (APMP) 2014 International Topical Meeting on","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982544/6994447/06994478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2014.6994478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994447","startPage":"17","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of commercial MIMO access point in distributed antenna system with different fiber lengths","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of commercial MIMO access point in distributed antenna system with different fiber lengths","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994478/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826362","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6994478/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of commercial MIMO access point in distributed antenna system with different fiber lengths","confLoc":"Hokkaido, Japan","sourcePdf":"p017fan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038683S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982544","isNumber":"6994447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982544","xplore-issue":"6994447","articleId":"6994478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6994492,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A spectrally-sparse RF signal with unknown frequencies is modulated onto a highly chirped optical pulse. An optical channelizer slices the modulated pulse spectrum, which is equivalent to temporally sampling the RF waveform thanks to the dispersion-induced wavelength-to-time mapping. This serial-to-parallel conversion avoids the use of a high-speed detector and digitizer. Furthermore, compressive sensing with optical random demodulation is achieved using a spatial light modulator, enabling the system to capture the wideband multi-tone RF signal with a sampling rate far lower than the Nyquist rate. It is demonstrated that the temporal channelization system with a channel spacing of 20 GHz achieves RF spectrum sensing with a high resolution of 196 MHz.

This new technique solves the bandwidth limitation of previous gain-transparent SBS-based phase shifters, while achieving unprecedented minimum power fluctuations, as a function of phase shift. We introduce a new paradigm where the phase and amplitude of the optical carrier are controlled independently. This is achieved by controlling the power of two SBS pumps. The first pump is used to tune the optical carrier power, while the second is used to shift the phase of the same carrier. This additional degree of freedom enables unparalleled control of the RF amplitude and phase response of the phase shifter. We demonstrate 360\u00b0 continuously tunable phase shift, with less than 0.25 dB output power fluctuations, over a frequency band from 1.5 to 31 GHz, limited only by the measurement equipment.","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2014.6994579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2014.6994579","startPage":"385","endPage":"388","displayPublicationTitle":"Microwave Photonics (MWP) and the 2014 9th Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference (APMP) 2014 International Topical Meeting on","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982544/6994447/06994579.pdf","publicationTitle":"Microwave Photonics (MWP) and the 2014 9th Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference (APMP) 2014 International Topical Meeting on","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-wideband RF photonic phase shifter with 360\u00b0 tunable phase and configurable amplitude response","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-wideband RF photonic phase shifter with 360\u00b0 tunable phase and configurable amplitude response","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994579/","accessionNumber":"14826351","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994579/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-wideband RF photonic phase shifter with 360\u00b0 tunable phase and configurable amplitude response","confLoc":"Hokkaido, Japan","sourcePdf":"p385pagani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072758S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982544","isNumber":"6994447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982544","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6994447","articleId":"6994579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6994580,"authors":[{"name":"Ton Koonen","affiliation":["COBRA, Eindhoven Univ. of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ton","lastName":"Koonen","id":"37282053100"},{"name":"Zizheng Cao","affiliation":["COBRA, Eindhoven Univ. of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zizheng","lastName":"Cao","id":"37307670900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-290-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6994580","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Beam steering","Tuning","Phased arrays","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","beam steering","delay circuits","optical communication equipment","optical control","optical tuning","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optically controlled 2D radio beam steering system","two-dimensional squint-free radio beam steering","single-parameter tuning","optical integrated circuit concept","step-wise wavelength-tunable interleaved true-time-delay stages","tuning functionality","elementary TTD stage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radio over fiber","radio beam steering","phased array antenna","optically tunable true time delay"]}],"abstract":"Two-dimensional squint-free radio beam steering by means of single-parameter tuning is proposed, based on a novel optical integrated circuit concept featuring step-wise wavelength-tunable interleaved true-time-delay stages.

The multivariable controller is designed in discrete time by using an extended state space feedback with integral action. The feedback gain is computed by using a linear quadratic regulator. Optimal constraints are tuned by genetic algorithms according to a cost function. As a result a robust multivariable controller is obtained by using state space feedback. This tuning procedure avoids the knowledge of the exact parameters of the system, and has the advantage that reduces the tracking error and decrease the rise time based on a performance index. Proposed methodology is applied over an induction motor in discrete time. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared against fixed controllers calculated by linear quadratic methods.","doi":"10.1109/CWCAS.2014.6994601","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 5th Colombian Workshop on Circuits and Systems (CWCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWCAS.2014.6994601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994599","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 5th Colombian Workshop on Circuits and Systems (CWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979778/6994599/06994601.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariable controller tuning using genetic algorithms for an induction motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994601/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multivariable controller tuning using genetic algorithms for an induction motor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994601/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14833245","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"16-17 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariable controller tuning using genetic algorithms for an induction motor","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"ID03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036613S","chronDate":"16-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979778","isNumber":"6994599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979778","xplore-issue":"6994599","articleId":"6994601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6994602,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Luis Diaz Rodriguez","affiliation":["University of Pampolana, Pamplona, Colombia"],"firstName":"Jorge Luis","lastName":"Diaz Rodriguez","id":"37085567673"},{"name":"Luis David Pabon Fernandez","affiliation":["University of Pampolana, Pamplona, Colombia"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"David Pabon Fernandez","id":"37085588483"},{"name":"Aldo Pardo Garcia","affiliation":["University of Pampolana, Pamplona, Colombia"],"firstName":"Aldo Pardo","lastName":"Garcia","id":"38574841300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6839-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6838-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6994602","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","MATLAB","Genetic algorithms","Pulse width modulation","Harmonic distortion","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","optimisation","power supply quality","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first quarter-wave modulation","firing angles","total harmonic distortion","power quality","genetic algorithms","multilevel PWM inverter","harmonic distortion optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel power inverters","multi-PWM","harmonic distortion","genetic algorithm","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994602","abstract":"This paper deals with the minimization of the harmonic distortion to improve the power quality by using 9 steps multilevel power converter, using genetic algorithms to optimized a multi-PWM modulation, and minimizing Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) to almost zero.

Since Hardware Description Languages describe circuits/systems in an imperative style and formalization tools use recursive specification languages, the kernel of our approach is based on a conservative translation from imperative into recursive implementations. The main challenge of this approach is that proofs follow an inductive schema that is based on guaranteeing pre and post-conditions and preservation of invariants during all steps of the recursive execution such as in the Floyd-Hoare's logical approach for verification of imperative procedures. The applicability of the methodology is illustrated in the Prototype Verification System (PVS) by proving the logical correctness of an FPGA implementation of the Gauss-Jordan matrix inversion algorithm (GJ). Correctness of this FPGA implementation is based on proving its functional equivalence (FEq) with an algebraic imperative definition of GJ. The approach allows formal verification of fragments of the implementations either simultaneously or afterwards the design process has been finished, avoiding in this way hardware development delays.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 27th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975719/6994620/06994634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2014 27th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","doi":"10.1145/2660540.2660982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2660540.2660982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verification of hardware implementations through correctness of their recursive definitions in PVS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Finite element analysis","Libraries","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","formal verification","hardware description languages","matrix inversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["verification implementations","recursive definitions","prototype verification system","PVS","logical correctness","reconfigurable hardware implementations","algebraic operators","hardware description languages","recursive specification languages","inductive schema","recursive execution","Floyd-Hoare logical approach","FPGA implementation","Gauss-Jordan matrix inversion algorithm","functional equivalence","algebraic imperative definition","formal verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Formal Verification","Hardware Verification","Recursive Definitions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Verification of hardware implementations through correctness of their recursive definitions in PVS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994634/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833209","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verification of hardware implementations through correctness of their recursive definitions in PVS","confLoc":"Aracaju, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a14almeida.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112274S","chronDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975719","isNumber":"6994620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975719","xplore-issue":"6994620","articleId":"6994634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6994642,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Toledo","affiliation":["NSCAD Microeletr\u00f4nica PGMICRO - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Toledo","id":"37085386595"},{"name":"Hamilton Klimach","affiliation":["PGMICRO - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Hamilton","lastName":"Klimach","id":"37265781600"},{"name":"David Cordova","affiliation":["NSCAD Microeletr\u00f4nica PGMICRO - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cordova","id":"38667562200"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["PGMICRO - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"},{"name":"Eric Fabris","affiliation":["NSCAD Microeletr\u00f4nica PGMICRO - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Fabris","id":"37265059500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6873-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6994642","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":936},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature dependence","MOSFET","Threshold voltage","Resistors","Logic gates","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","MOSFET circuits","reference circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-biased CMOS current reference","ZTC operation condition","MOSFET zero temperature coefficient","low TC biasing","circuit simulations","local mismatch variability","power supply sensitivity","size 0.18 mum","current 5 muA","voltage 1.4 V to 1.8 V","temperature -40 degC to 85 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ZTC Operating Point","Current Reference Source","Low Temperature Coefficient"]}],"abstract":"A self-biased current reference based on the MOSFET Zero Temperature Coefficient (ZTC) condition is presented.

Once the global clock signal is a main concern for synchronous systems design, asynchronous circuits seem to be an interesting alternative, once they don't present clock skew and clock distribution problems. However, the lack of tools for automatic synthesis is a major drawback. This paper proposes a new algorithm for state assignment of Extended Burst-Mode Asynchronous Finite State Machines (XBM_AFSM), which are widely used in the design of Controllers of asynchronous digital systems. The proposal is based on genetic algorithm and introduces a novel style of state assignment. It improves the results and overcomes the previous methods found in literature once it addresses the \u201cstate minimization\u201d, the \u201cfree of critical race coding\u201d and \u201ccoverage\u201d as a single problem. Furthermore, it is able to detect the conflicts in XBM specification and insert the minimum number of state variables in the XBM specification to eliminate those conflicts. A dedicated computational tool called SAGAAs implements the algorithm and was tested to a set of 36 benchmarks. When compared to 3D tool, our method achieved an average reduction of 13.33%, 35.65%, 32.15% and 39.12% in the number of state variables, number of products, number of literals and the number of switching, respectively. When compared to Minimalist tool, SAGAAs provided an average reduction of 52% in the number of inserted state variables, 11% in the number of literals, and a penalty of 8% in the number of products. Results show that the method and the dedicated computational tool SAGAAs achieved good and reliable results, showing a high potential of practical implementation in actual circuits design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994657/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14833190","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994657/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","conferenceDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel state assignment method for Extended Burst-Mode FSM design using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel state assignment method for Extended Burst-Mode FSM design using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Aracaju, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a39curtinhas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078567S","chronDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975719","isNumber":"6994620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975719","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6994620","articleId":"6994657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6994749,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

WPT technology is in its infancy; standardization is lacking, especially on interoperability, center frequency selection, magnetic fringe field suppression, and the methods employed for power flow regulation. This paper proposes a new analysis concept for power flow in WPT in which the primary provides frequency selection and the tuned secondary, with its resemblance to a power transmission network having a reactive power voltage control, is analyzed as a transmission network. Analysis is supported with experimental data taken from Oak Ridge National Laboratory's WPT apparatus.

While the vast majority of previous work assumes isotropic antenna elements or omnidirectional dipoles, this work demonstrates that improved DOA estimation accuracy and increased bandwidth is achievable with appropriately-designed directional antennas. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is derived for UCAs with directional antennas and is compared to isotropic antennas for 4- and 8-element arrays using a theoretical radiation pattern. The directivity that minimizes the CRLB is identified and microstrip patch antennas approximating the optimal theoretical gain pattern are designed to compare the resulting DOA estimation accuracy with a UCA using dipole antenna elements. Simulation results show improved DOA estimation accuracy and robustness using microstrip patch antennas as opposed to conventional dipoles. Additionally, it is shown that the bandwidth of a UCA for DOA estimation is limited only by the broadband characteristics of the directional antenna elements and not by the electrical size of the array as is the case with omnidirectional antennas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Directive Antennas in Uniform Circular Arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2384044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7027885/06994760.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2384044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Directive Antennas in Uniform Circular Arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6994760/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14915003","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Directive Antennas in Uniform Circular Arrays","sourcePdf":"tap-jackson-2384044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090627S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6994760","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6994761,"authors":[{"name":"Slavche Pejoski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, University \u201cSs.

To overcome the significant propagation loss over distance, employing multi-antennas at the energy transmitter (ET) to more efficiently direct wireless energy to desired energy receivers (ERs), termed energy beamforming, is an essential technique for enabling WET. However, the achievable gain of energy beamforming crucially depends on the available channel state information (CSI) at the ET, which needs to be acquired practically. In this paper, we study the design of an efficient channel acquisition method for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) WET system by exploiting the channel reciprocity, i.e., the ET estimates the CSI via dedicated reverse-link training from the ER. Considering the limited energy availability at the ER, the training strategy should be carefully designed so that the channel can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, and yet without consuming excessive energy at the ER. To this end, we propose to maximize the net harvested energy at the ER, which is the average harvested energy offset by that used for channel training. An optimization problem is formulated for the training design over MIMO Rician fading channels, including the subset of ER antennas to be trained, as well as the training time and power allocated. Closed-form solutions are obtained for some special scenarios, based on which useful insights are drawn on when training should be employed to improve the net transferred energy in MIMO WET systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06994766.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Training Design for Wireless Energy Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Training Design for Wireless Energy Transfer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994766/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14930604","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994766/","volume":"63","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001352","fundingName":"National University of Singapore","grantNumber":"R-263-000-679-133"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Training Design for Wireless Energy Transfer","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zeng-2385077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155412S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6994766","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6994775,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Ivanov","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Ivanov","id":"38666263400"},{"name":"Fredrik Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","id":"37283169100"},{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Graell i Amat","id":"37279070400"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6994775","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Throughput","Reliability","Parity check codes","Simulation","Bipartite graph","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel coding","error analysis","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error floor analysis","coded slotted ALOHA","packet erasure channels","finite frame length","bipartite graph","unequal error protection"]},{"kwd":["Coded slotted ALOHA","error floor","packet erasure channel","stopping set","unequal error protection"]}],"abstract":"We present a framework for the analysis of the error floor of coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) for finite frame lengths over the packet erasure channel.

Through this extended SU-MIMO channel model, the effects of transceiver hardware impairments on the achievable rate of multi-antenna point-to-point systems are studied. Channel input distributions encompassing practical discrete modulation schemes, such as, QAM and PSK, as well as Gaussian signaling are covered. In addition, the impact of mismatched detection and decoding when the receiver has insufficient information about the non-idealities is investigated. The numerical results show that for realistic system parameters, the effects of transmit-side noise and mismatched decoding become significant only at high modulation orders.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7060754/06994787.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7060754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Analysis of SU-MIMO Channels With Transmitter Noise and Mismatched Joint Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Decoding","Receivers","Hardware","MIMO","Vectors","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","decoding","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio links","radio transceivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatched detection","Gaussian signaling","PSK","QAM","discrete modulation scheme","channel input distribution","multi-antenna point-to-point system","transceiver hardware","SU-MIMO channel model","additive noise term","multiple-input multiple-output system","binoisy single-user MIMO","mismatched joint decoding","transmitter noise","asymptotic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple antennas","mismatched decoding","ergodic capacity","fading channels","generalized mutual information (GMI)","transceiver hardware impairments"]},{"kwd":["Multiple antennas","mismatched decoding","ergodic capacity","fading channels","generalized mutual information (GMI)","transceiver hardware impairments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Analysis of SU-MIMO Channels With Transmitter Noise and Mismatched Joint Decoding","volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6994787/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14998006","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council"},{"fundingName":"ERC Starting","grantNumber":"305123 MORE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Analysis of SU-MIMO Channels With Transmitter Noise and Mismatched Joint Decoding","sourcePdf":"tcomm-vehkapera-2385051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132324S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7060754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7060754","articleId":"6994787","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994788,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Hyun Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6994788/choi-2385044-small.gif","p":["\nJung-Hyun Choi was born in Jeonju, Korea, in 1988.

The open-switch faults in the inverter incur overcurrent stress to other electric components, resulting in a severe secondary fault in the entire system. As compared with the conventional schemes that the fault detection and faulty switch identification rely on the averaging or current error from the reference value, the proposed algorithms are achieved through signal processing schemes such as harmonic analysis, averaging, and waveform analysis by using only the measured current information. In addition, the proposed scheme classifies the open-switch faults as four faulty groups according to their unique fault signature, which enables the proposed scheme to identify faulty switches effectively. Since the fault detection is accomplished by using the relative magnitude of the second-order harmonic component in phase currents, the influence on steady-state error or dc offset of current is significantly reduced. Once the fault is detected, the operating mode is changed to identify the faulty group which the fault belongs to. By identifying the faulty group, the faulty switches can be found in a much more straightforward way. The entire LIM drive system is implemented using DSP TMS320F28335 to verify the feasibility of the proposed fault detection and faulty switch identification schemes. Without requiring any additional hardware or measuring apparatus, the proposed diagnostic algorithm can effectively detect a fault even under simultaneous open-switch faults by online basis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994788/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","volume":"62","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15142380","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6994788/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Diagnostic Method of Simultaneous Open-Switch Faults in Inverter-Fed Linear Induction Motor Drive for Reliability Enhancement","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Gyeonggi Regional Research Center (GRRC) program of Gyeonggi Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Diagnostic Method of Simultaneous Open-Switch Faults in Inverter-Fed Linear Induction Motor Drive for Reliability Enhancement","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2385044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090457S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7109198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7109198","articleId":"6994788","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6994789,"authors":[{"name":"Shirin Ghaffari","affiliation":["Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/7073672/6994789/ghaff-2374451-small.gif","p":["Shirin Ghaffari received the B.S. degree in aerospace engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

Accurate prediction of the quality factor is essential for designing high-performance microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices. Several energy dissipation mechanisms contribute to the quality factor. Due to computational complexity, highly simplified models for the dominant dissipation mechanism, such as Zener's model for thermoelastic dissipation (TED), are often employed. However, the intuition provided by these models is inadequate to predict the quality factor of more complex designs and can be highly misleading. In this paper, we construct complete, quantitative, and predictive models with finite-element methods for the intrinsic energy dissipation mechanisms in MEMS resonators using full anisotropic representation of crystalline silicon and the temperature dependence of all parameters. We find that TED is often a more significant source of damping than has been assumed, because of the previously neglected role of crystalline anisotropy and small geometric features, such as etch release holes-all of which can now be included in practical models. We show that these models, along with simpler scaling models for extrinsic dissipation mechanisms, explain measurements of quality factor in diverse sets of MEMS resonators with unprecedented accuracy.

The variance of the interference is assumed to be proportional to the \u03bb-th power of the transmitted power. The worst-case pairwise error probability (PEP) is considered as the performance criterion. To find the optimal power allocation, we first derive a closed-form expression for the derivative of the PEP. A simple bisection method is then applied to obtain the optimal scheme. An asymptotically optimal allocation in closed form is also obtained assuming high power regions. From this analysis, it is shown that power allocation leads to a better diversity performance than full power transmission. In addition, the error floor behavior observed in previous works can be eliminated through power allocation. Numerical results are finally presented to illustrate the advantage of the proposed scheme over full power usage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Control and Error Performance for Full-Duplex Dual-Hop AF Relaying Under Residual Self-Interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06994793.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Control and Error Performance for Full-Duplex Dual-Hop AF Relaying Under Residual Self-Interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6994793/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914550","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Control and Error Performance for Full-Duplex Dual-Hop AF Relaying Under Residual Self-Interference","sourcePdf":"lcomm-tran-2385093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092198S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6994793","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994802,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085487467"},{"name":"Min Sheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37410574200"},{"name":"Xijun Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38667163200"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814700"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["School of Physics and Information Technology, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"38088919400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6994802","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":779},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Cognitive radio","Quality of service","Resource management","Blogs","Programming","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","duality (mathematics)","energy conservation","fading channels","optimisation","probability","quality of service","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean energy efficiency maximization","cognitive radio channel fading","PU outage probability constraint","future green wireless communication systems","CRNs","cognitive radio networks","EE design","mean EE maximization problem","secondary user","SUs","primary users","quality of service","QoS","mean transmit power constraints","peak transmit power constraints","fractional programming","Lagrangian duality theory","optimal power allocation strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","energy efficiency","outage constraint","fading channels"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","energy efficiency","outage constraint","fading channels"]}],"abstract":"Energy efficiency (EE) is very crucial for future green wireless communication systems, particularly for cognitive radio networks (CRNs). However, the EE design for CRNs in fast-fading scenarios has not been fully studied. This letter investigates the mean EE maximization problem for the secondary user (SU) in the fading cognitive radio channels consisting of both SUs and primary users (PUs). We adopt PU outage probability constraint to ensure the quality of service (QoS) of PUs and consider both the peak and mean transmit power constraints for SUs. However, this problem is nontrivial since the mean EE is nonconvex and PU outage probability constraint belongs to chance constraints. With the aid of the fractional programming and Lagrangian duality theory, we propose an efficient algorithm to derive the optimal power allocation strategy for SU to maximize its mean EE while guaranteeing the QoS of PUs. Simulation results assess the performance of our proposed scheme and show the tradeoff between SUs' mean EE and PU outage probability threshold only in some certain range.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06994802.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean Energy Efficiency Maximization in Cognitive Radio Channels With PU Outage Constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mean Energy Efficiency Maximization in Cognitive Radio Channels With PU Outage Constraint","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914539","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6994802/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231008, 61172079 , 61201141, 61301176 and 91338114"},{"fundingName":"National S&T Major Project","grantNumber":"2012ZX03004002"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean Energy Efficiency Maximization in Cognitive Radio Channels With PU Outage Constraint","sourcePdf":"lcomm-sheng-2385057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067187S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6994802","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994804,"authors":[{"name":"Ronen Dar","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Ronen Dar received the B.Sc. degree (cum laude) and\n the M.Sc. degree (summa cum laude) both in electrical engineering, from the Tel-Aviv University,\n Israel, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we propose and demonstrate new ac-biased single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits, and search for synergy of ac and currently dominating dc biasing schemes. As the first step, we suggest an on-chip ac/dc converter capable of feeding a few dc-biased gates surrounded by their ac-biased counterparts. As the second step, we introduce and present the first successful demonstration of a new ac-powered circuit-an 8192-bit shift register with over 32800 Josephson junctions (JJs) and JJ density of about 6 \u00b7 105 JJ per cm2. We suggest a few niche applications for this type of ac-biased circuits, which require high clock rates. For example, these circuits, scalable to millions of JJs per chip, can serve as a convenient benchmark for new SFQ fabrication technology nodes, allowing the operating margins of individual cells to be extracted and thus \u201cvisualize\u201d individual fabrication defects and flux trapping events. The circuit can also be developed into a megapixel imaging array for a magnetic field microscope.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied

In order to meet the interference threshold requirement for a primary receiver at an arbitrary location, we consider different SU activity protocols that limit the number of active SUs. We propose a framework, based on the moment-generating function of the interference due to a random SU, to analytically compute the outage probability in the primary network, as well as the average number of active SUs in the secondary network. We also propose a cooperation-based SU activity protocol in the underlay cognitive network that includes the existing threshold-based protocol as a special case. We study the average number of active SUs for the different SU activity protocols, subject to a given outage probability constraint at the PU, and we employ it as an analytical approach to compare the effect of different SU activity protocols on the performance of the primary and secondary networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Arbitrarily-Shaped Underlay Cognitive Networks: Effects of Secondary User Activity Protocols","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385065","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06994834.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Arbitrarily-Shaped Underlay Cognitive Networks: Effects of Secondary User Activity Protocols","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6994834/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14930601","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Arbitrarily-Shaped Underlay Cognitive Networks: Effects of Secondary User Activity Protocols","sourcePdf":"tcomm-guo-2385065-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137665S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6994834","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6994836,"authors":[{"name":"Geng-Shen Fu","affiliation":["University of Maryland School of Law, Baltimore, MD, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6994902/6994836/6994836-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Geng-Shen Fu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the Dalian University of Technology, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

Different from the unsupervised principal-component-analysis model, the response variable is incorporated for the supervision of selecting latent variables in the PPCR model. By introducing two hyperparameter vectors, the effectiveness of each latent variable can be well measured and controlled. For the mixture form of the PPCR model, a corresponding mixture Bayesian regularization strategy is further developed to control the dimensionality of latent variables. The expectation-maximization algorithm is employed for the parameter learning of both single and mixture Bayesian regularization models. Two probabilistic soft sensors are then developed for the online estimation of key variables in industrial processes, the performances of which are evaluated through two case studies. Compared to the single Bayesian regularization model, the mixture model shows stronger soft sensing abilities in nonlinear and multimode processes.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2385042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7109198/06994842.pdf","startPage":"4336","endPage":"4343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2385042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7109198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixture Bayesian Regularization of PCR Model and Soft Sensing Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994842/","displayDocTitle":"Mixture Bayesian Regularization of PCR Model and Soft Sensing Application","volume":"62","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15142396","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994842/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (61370029)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixture Bayesian Regularization of PCR Model and Soft Sensing Application","sourcePdf":"tie-ge-2385042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065506S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7109198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7109198","articleId":"6994842","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6994843,"authors":[{"name":"Farzam Nejabatkhah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7219485/6994843/nejab-small.gif","p":["Farzam Nejabatkhah (S'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees\n (both with honors) in electrical engineering from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, in 2009 and 2011,\n respectively.

This formulation is relevant in Big Data scenarios where large dictionary models may be spread over different spatial locations and it is not feasible to aggregate all dictionaries in one location due to communication and privacy considerations. We first show that the dual function of the inference problem is an aggregation of individual cost functions associated with different agents, which can then be minimized efficiently by means of diffusion strategies. The collaborative inference step generates dual variables that are used by the agents to update their dictionaries without the need to share these dictionaries or even the coefficient models for the training data. This is a powerful property that leads to an effective distributed procedure for learning dictionaries over large networks (e.g., hundreds of agents in our experiments). Furthermore, the proposed learning strategy operates in an online manner and is able to respond to streaming data, where each data sample is presented to the network once.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7017617/06994844.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2385045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2385045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7017617","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dictionary Learning Over Distributed Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Vectors","Cost function","Nickel","Distributed databases","Aggregates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference mechanisms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionary learning","distributed models","dictionary elements","dictionary models","inference problem","diffusion strategies","collaborative inference step","coefficient models","learning strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bi-clustering","conjugate functions","dictionary learning","diffusion strategies","distributed model","dual decomposition","image denoising","novel document detection","topic modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Dictionary Learning Over Distributed Models","volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6994844/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14866836","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dictionary Learning Over Distributed Models","sourcePdf":"tsp-sayed-2385045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122818S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7017617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7017617","articleId":"6994844","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6994846,"authors":[{"name":"Ranga Prasad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7041264/6994846/prasa-2385060_print-small.gif","p":["\nRanga Prasad received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication\nengineering from the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE), Bangalore, India, in 2005.

The MIMO X channel (XC) consists of two multiple antenna transmit-receive pairs, where each transmitter communicates with both receivers. The MIMO Z channel (ZC) is obtained from the MIMO X channel by eliminating one of the links and its corresponding message. First, we derive a sum-rate upper bound for the MIMO Z channel and compare it with an existing bound in literature. Next, we consider the MIMO X channel and propose a new sum-rate upper bound by utilizing the sum-rate upper bound for the MIMO ZC. Subsequently, we derive another upper bound for the MIMO XC by assuming receiver cooperation and deriving the worst noise covariance matrix for the resulting two-user MAC. We compare the above two upper bounds for the MIMO XC with the MaddahAli-Motahari-Khandani (MMK) scheme. Then, we consider some consequences of the above results for the MIMO interference channel. Finally, we present some numerical results. The numerical results suggest that the proposed sum-rate capacity upper bounds are tighter than existing bounds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6994846/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14930605","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Sum-Rate of the Gaussian MIMO Z Channel and the Gaussian MIMO X Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Sum-Rate of the Gaussian MIMO Z Channel and the Gaussian MIMO X Channel","sourcePdf":"tcomm-prasad-2385060-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096352S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6994846","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6994852,"authors":[{"name":"Cesar F.

Moreover, we show that, an interesting property of multi-way measurements allows us to build the reconstruction based on compressive linear measurements taken only in two selected modes, independently of the tensor order N. In addition, it is proved that, in the matrix case and in a particular case with 3rd-order tensors where the same 2D sensor operator is applied to all mode-3 slices, the proposed reconstruction X\u03c4 is stable in the sense that the approximation error is comparable to the one provided by the best low-multilinear-rank approximation, where \u03c4 is a threshold parameter that controls the approximation error. Through the analysis of the upper bound of the approximation error we show that, in the 2D case, an optimal value for the threshold parameter \u03c4 = \u03c40 > 0 exists, which is confirmed by our simulation results. On the other hand, our experiments on 3D datasets show that very good reconstructions are obtained using \u03c4 = 0, which means that this parameter does not need to be tuned. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate the stability and robustness of the method when it is applied to real-world 2D and 3D signals. A comparison with state-of-the-arts sparsity based CS methods specialized for multidimensional signals is also included. A very attractive characteristic of the proposed method is that it provides a direct computation, i.e., it is non-iterative in contrast to all existing sparsity based CS algorithms, thus providing super fast computations, even for large datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2385040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2385040","startPage":"780","endPage":"793","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6994902/06994852.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable, Robust, and Super Fast Reconstruction of Tensors Using Multi-Way Projections","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Stable, Robust, and Super Fast Reconstruction of Tensors Using Multi-Way Projections","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2015","volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994852/","accessionNumber":"14846960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994852/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003074","fundingName":"Agencia Nacional de Promoci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Tecnol\u00f3gica","grantNumber":"#1519"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002923","fundingName":"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas","grantNumber":"#114-201101-00021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable, Robust, and Super Fast Reconstruction of Tensors Using Multi-Way Projections","sourcePdf":"tsp-caiafa-2385040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126213S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6994902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6994902","articleId":"6994852","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6994853,"authors":[{"name":"Elizete M.

Backward and forward couplers as well as strong coupling-defined forward couplers are presented and developed. They are composed of two joined SIW sections such that the common wall between them is made of a portion of the broad side of the first SIW and the narrow side of the second SIW. This perpendicular topology is arranged and formed through the use of a LEGO-like interconnect between the two SIW structures. Different coupling geometries developed with a low-cost printed circuit board process are studied. Design considerations and measured results at Ka-band are presented and discussed. To achieve respectively weak backward and forward directional couplings, Schwinger and multihole-type directional couplers are introduced first of all, which make use of coupling slots arranged around the center of the SIW broad wall. For each of those structures, a wideband 20-dB directional coupler is fabricated and measured for demonstration purposes. To achieve a strong coupling, a Riblet-type directional coupler is proposed and examined. Subsequently, a 3-dB coupler is demonstrated together with a 0-dB coupler, offering a wideband and very efficient transition between the perpendicularly arranged SIWs. The proposed directional couplers can be used at millimeter-wave frequencies for probing and the design of compact 3-D integrated circuits and systems such as polarimetric imaging radiometer or antenna array feeding networks.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2376560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7000613/06994856.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2376560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7000613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Substrate Integrated Waveguide Directional Couplers for Compact Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Substrate Integrated Waveguide Directional Couplers for Compact Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6994856/","accessionNumber":"14835081","volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Substrate Integrated Waveguide Directional Couplers for Compact Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tmtt-doghri-2376560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147137S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7000613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7000613","articleId":"6994856","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6994857,"authors":[{"name":"Karsten Fyhn","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7017617/6994857/6994857-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karsten Fyhn obtained his M.Sc. in wireless communication from Aalborg University, Denmark in 2010 as a student at the ELITE-programme at Aalborg University, a special research programme for highly skilled and motivated students.

Our work extends previous approaches involving polar interpolation for compressive parameter estimation in two aspects: (i) we extend the formulation from real non-negative amplitude parameters to arbitrary complex ones, and (ii) we allow for mismatch between the manifold described by the parameters and its polar approximation. To quantify the improvements afforded by the proposed extensions, we evaluate six algorithms for estimation of parameters in sparse translation-invariant signals, exemplified with the time delay estimation problem. The evaluation is based on three performance metrics: estimator precision, sampling rate and computational complexity. We use compressive sensing with all the algorithms to lower the necessary sampling rate and show that it is still possible to attain good estimation precision and keep the computational complexity low. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing approaches that either leverage polynomial interpolation or are based on a conversion to a frequency-estimation problem followed by a super-resolution algorithm. The algorithms studied here provide various tradeoffs between computational complexity, estimation precision, and necessary sampling rate. The work shows that compressive sensing for the class of sparse translation-invariant signals allows for a decrease in sampling rate and that the use of polar interpolation increases the estimation precision.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Dictionaries","Estimation","Convex functions","Signal processing algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Greedy algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","delay estimation","frequency estimation","interpolation","polynomial approximation","signal resolution","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["super resolution algorithm","frequency estimation problem","polynomial interpolation","compressive sensing","computational complexity","sampling rate","estimator precision","time delay estimation","polar interpolation","compressive parameter estimation","sparse translation-invariant signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","interpolation","time delay estimation","translation-invariant signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2385035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7017617/06994857.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7017617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2385035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Parameter Estimation for Sparse Translation-Invariant Signals Using Polar Interpolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Parameter Estimation for Sparse Translation-Invariant Signals Using Polar Interpolation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994857/","volume":"63","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994857/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14866846","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Parameter Estimation for Sparse Translation-Invariant Signals Using Polar Interpolation","sourcePdf":"tsp-fyhn-2385035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093762S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7017617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7017617","articleId":"6994857","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6994860,"authors":[{"name":"Piya Pal","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA","University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6994902/6994860/6994860-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Piya Pal (S'08) received her Bachelors in Technology degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India in 2007, and her Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Caltech in 2013, where her Ph.D thesis won the Charles and Ellen Wilts Prize for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis in Electrical Engineering.

A key contribution of this paper is to show that if existing algorithms can recover sparse support of size s, then using such correlation information, the guaranteed size of recoverable support can be increased to O(s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), although the sparse signal itself may not be recoverable. This is proved to be possible by (a) formulating the sparse support recovery problem in terms of the covariance matrix of the measurements, and (b) designing a suitable measurement/sampling matrix which inherently exploits the correlation priors. The so-called Khatri-Rao product of the measurement matrix is shown to play an important role in deciding the level of recoverable sparsity. A systematic analysis of the proposed framework is also presented for the cases when the covariance matrix is only approximately known, by estimating it from finite number of measurements, obtained from the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) model. In this case, the use of LASSO on the estimated covariance matrix is proposed for recovering the support. However, the recovery may not be exact and hence a probabilistic guarantee is developed both for sources with arbitrary distribution as well as for Gaussian sources.

AR-SaBEr was enhanced with knowledge-based support and inquiry-based scaffolding mechanisms, which proved useful for discovery learning in Web-based simulation environments. Learning performance factors evaluated included students' learning behavior while interacting with the system, AR-SaBEr's learning effectiveness, and students' motivation in using the AR-based simulation environment. The study suggests that AR simulators can be exploited as effective learning environments for learning the basic principles of electricity. It would, however, be necessary to consider a number of scaffolding options to improve the learning effectiveness of AR-based simulation environments when used with students who have low levels of either: 1) self-regulation skills, or 2) motivation to engage in AR-based simulation activities.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Electricity","Encoding","Augmented reality","Resistance","Computational modeling","Battery charge measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","computer aided instruction","digital simulation","human factors","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality-based simulators","discovery learning tools","AR-SaBEr","knowledge-based support","inquiry-based scaffolding mechanisms","Web-based simulation environments","learning performance factors","student learning behavior","student motivation","AR-based simulation environment","learning effectiveness","AR-based simulation environments","self-regulation skills"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Augmented reality","computer simulation","learning effectiveness","mobile learning","physics education","self-regulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TE.2014.2379712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel7/13/7174603/06994871.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2014.2379712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmented Reality-Based Simulators as Discovery Learning Tools: An Empirical Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994871","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Reality-Based Simulators as Discovery Learning Tools: An Empirical Study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994871/","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994871/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15328423","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish project EEE","grantNumber":"TIN2011-28308-C03-01"},{"fundingName":"and the Spanish project eMadrid","grantNumber":"S2009/TIC-1650"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented Reality-Based Simulators as Discovery Learning Tools: An Empirical Study","sourcePdf":"te-ibanez-2379712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081322S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"7174603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7174603","articleId":"6994871","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6994876,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7229427/6994876/guo-small.gif","p":["Bin Guo received the PhD degree in computer science from Keio\n University, Japan, in 2009, and then was a post-doc researcher at Institut Mines-TELECOM/TELECOM SudParis, France.\n He is currently a professor at Northwestern Polytechnical University, China.

Posted fliers advertise services, events, and other announcements. However, fliers posted offline suffer from problems such as limited spatial-temporal coverage and inefficient search support. In recent years, with the development of sensor-enhanced mobile devices, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has been used in a variety of application areas. This paper presents FlierMeet, a crowd-powered sensing system for cross-space public information reposting, tagging, and sharing. The tags learned are useful for flier sharing and preferred information retrieval and suggestion. Specifically, we utilize various contexts (e.g., spatio-temporal info, flier publishing/reposting behaviors, etc.) and textual features to group similar reposts and classify them into categories. We further identify a novel set of crowd-object interaction hints to predict the semantic tags of reposts. To evaluate our system, 38 participants were recruited and 2,035 reposts were captured during an eight-week period. Experiments on this dataset showed that our approach to flier grouping is effective and the proposed features are useful for flier category/semantic tagging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994876/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2015","volume":"14","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15414336","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6994876/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FlierMeet: A Mobile Crowdsensing System for Cross-Space Public Information Reposting, Tagging, and Sharing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB352400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61103063, 61332005, 61373119 and 61222209"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FlierMeet: A Mobile Crowdsensing System for Cross-Space Public Information Reposting, Tagging, and Sharing","sourcePdf":"tmc-guo-2385097-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104476S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7229427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7229427","articleId":"6994876","onlineDate":"22 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6994877,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elshamy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7302619/6994877/elsha-2377192-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Elshamy was born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1986.

Memristor, which is recently discovered and known as the missing fourth circuit element, is a potential candidate for the next-generation memory. Memristor has received extra attention in the last few years. To support this effort, this paper presents a novel read/write circuit that facilitates the reading and writing operation of the Memristor device as a memory element. The advantages of the proposed read/write circuit are threefold. First, the proposed circuit has a nondestructive successive reading cycle capability. Second, it occupies less die area.

It is developed to improve the robustness against estimation errors of direction of arrival (DOA) and limited sample number, as well as reduce the number of constraints. By incorporating forward-backward estimation and worst-case performance optimization method into the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beam former, the RB-WC-FB (robust worst-case forward-backward) beam former is developed. However, there still exists a problem of over-constrained in the RB-WC-FB beam former. To overcome this, a response variation (RV) element is introduced. Due to an increased number of degrees of freedom for interference suppression, a higher SINR can be obtained by the RB-WC-FI-FB beam former. The RB-WC-FI-FB beam former is formulated as a second-order cone (SOC) programming convex optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using interior point methods. Simulation results show that the proposed beam former has higher SINR compared with earlier robust beam forming techniques.","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2014.9","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990415/6994949/06994979.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2014.9","publicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Robust Wideband Beamformer with Frequency Invariance Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6994979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Robust Wideband Beamformer with Frequency Invariance Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6994979/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6994979/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14847514","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Robust Wideband Beamformer with Frequency Invariance Constraints","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"6575a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054341S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990415","isNumber":"6994949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990415","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6994949","articleId":"6994979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6994987,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Guang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Guang","id":"37085444246"},{"name":"Liu Qi","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085448313"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6575-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6574-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6994987","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Vectors","MIMO radar","Arrays","Matching pursuit algorithms","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","covariance matrices","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended matrix compressed sensing based angle estimation","noncircular source","MIMO radar","CS theory","multiple input multiple output radar","reduced-dimensional matrix","data matrix transformation","orthogonal matching pursuit","OMP","estimation of signal parameter via rotational invariance technique","reduced-dimension ESPRIT","RD-ESPRIT algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["monostatic radar","noncircular signal","OMP","angle estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of applying compressed sensing (CS) theory to angle estimation for noncircular sources in monostatic multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) radar, and propose an angle estimation algorithm based on extended matrix compressed sensing.

Our research indicates that the correlation coefficient in the ML estimator is the function of symbol synchronization position during the ergodic process to find the maximum of likelihood function and it should not be treated as a constant. Based on this observation, an improved calculation procedure for the ML estimator of symbol synchronization position is derived. The results from computer simulations and actual experiments show that the improved ML estimator of symbol synchronization position has better performance than the previous one.","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2014.50","publicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990415/6994949/06995020.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2014.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994949","startPage":"207","endPage":"210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Symbol Synchronization Method for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Symbol Synchronization Method for OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995020/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838247","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6995020/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Symbol Synchronization Method for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"6575a207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04712S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990415","isNumber":"6994949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990415","xplore-issue":"6994949","articleId":"6995020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6995026,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Xuhui","affiliation":["Higher Education Key Lab for Measuring & Control Technology and Instrumentations of Heilongjiang, Sichuan Normal University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Xuhui","id":"37690131100"},{"name":"Peng Zhixuan","affiliation":["Higher Education Key Lab for Measuring & Control Technology and Instrumentations of Heilongjiang, Sichuan Normal University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhixuan","id":"37075871200"},{"name":"Mao Suying","affiliation":["Higher Education Key Lab for Measuring & Control Technology and Instrumentations of Heilongjiang, Sichuan Normal University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Mao","lastName":"Suying","id":"37085529702"},{"name":"Wang Wenping","affiliation":["Higher Education Key Lab for Measuring & Control Technology and Instrumentations of Heilongjiang, Sichuan Normal University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Wenping","id":"37545981300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6575-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6574-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6995026","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine animals","Particle swarm optimization","Power measurement","Voltage measurement","Visualization","Parameter estimation","Attenuation measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","multipath channels","particle swarm optimisation","power cables","power system parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line multipath transmission model parameter identification","hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","carrier communication channel voltage measurement data","AFSA","power line channel model","PSO","artificial fish swarm algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power line multipath model","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA)","Parameter identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995026","abstract":"On the basis of the existing power line multipath transmission model, as the 0.5~20MHz actual low carrier communication channel voltage measurement data for the sample, this article makes the use of the fish hybrid particle swarm algorithm to finish multi-parameter identification.

In addition, the algorithm effectively solves the problem of inverse kinematics and overcomes the defects of traditional methods for solving inverse kinematics, such as large amount of calculation, slow convergence rate and low accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2014.93","startPage":"418","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2014.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994949","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990415/6994949/06995063.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Algorithm for Solving Inverse Kinematics of Robot Based on BP and RBF Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995063/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Algorithm for Solving Inverse Kinematics of Robot Based on BP and RBF Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6995063/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14838236","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Algorithm for Solving Inverse Kinematics of Robot Based on BP and RBF Neural Network","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"6575a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062233S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990415","isNumber":"6994949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990415","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6994949","articleId":"6995063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6995065,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Zhilu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Zhilu","id":"37422577200"},{"name":"Yin Liang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085415875"},{"name":"Cui Kai","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Cui","lastName":"Kai","id":"37085417594"},{"name":"Yin Zhendong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Zhendong","id":"37422561500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6575-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6574-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6995065","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Multiuser detection","Field programmable gate arrays","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Algorithm design and analysis","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","least mean squares methods","matched filters","Monte Carlo methods","multiuser detection","satellite communication","satellite tracking","signal processing","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate array","FPGA implementation","minimum mean square error algorithm","multiuser detection","MMSE MUD algorithm","tracking and data relay satellite system","TDRSS","multiple user satellites monitor","monitoring network coverage","multitarget signal processing","multiple user satellites communication","matched filter","Monte Carlo simulation","Matlab","UART"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DS-CDMA","MUD","MMSE","FPGA Implementation"]}],"abstract":"Multiple user satellites monitor is an important technology which can improve both the monitoring network coverage and the capacity of multi-target signal processing.

They have combined the compressed sensing (CS) based non-reconstruction technology with the conventional energy detection (ED) method and proposed a non-reconstruction detection method to detect the spectrum directly from the CS sampled data, these methods can decrease the sampling rate and computation complexity. But these methods assume that the measurement matrix is a Gaussian random matrix, it is hard to generate in a practical application and its detection performance has a big loss compared with the conventional energy detection method. In this paper we propose an iterative method to optimize the measurement matrix aiming at improving the detection performance. The Gram matrix of the optimized matrix will be closer to the identity matrix through iterative method. The simulation result shows that the optimized measurement matrix can improve the detection performance of the non-reconstruction detection method for about 2 dB compared with the Gaussian random matrix.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995075/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14838214","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6995075/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the Measurement Matrix Used for CS-Based Non-Reconstruction Detection Method in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the Measurement Matrix Used for CS-Based Non-Reconstruction Detection Method in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"6575a484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122205S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990415","isNumber":"6994949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990415","xplore-issue":"6994949","articleId":"6995075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6995078,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Wei","affiliation":["Automation Department, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37533197700"},{"name":"Ma Yuehua","affiliation":["Automation Department, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Yuehua","id":"37547983400"},{"name":"Wang Xianpeng","affiliation":["Automation Department, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xianpeng","id":"37085509441"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6575-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6574-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6995078","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"A high-resolution MIMO radar imaging method based on Capon beam forming is presented in this paper.

We assume that the receiver only knows the channel information related to the specular component and treat the Rayleigh fading component as interference. We first present a maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) -like detection scheme only based on the specular component, and in order to analyze the reliability performance, derive receive signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) expressions for scenarios without and with receive spacialcorrelation. Then we extend the above SINR analysis to the scenario over frequency-selective channels as well as the one in the presence of co-channel interference. Finally, we provide some numerical results to validate the theoretical results, and show by simulation results that different from the conventional view, the strong spatial correlation can provide better reliability performance than the weak one.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Interference","Correlation","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cochannel interference","correlation theory","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale SIMO system","specular component","correlated Rician flat fading environment","single input multiple output system","antenna array","channel information","Rayleigh fading component","maximum-ratio-combining-like detection scheme","MRC-like detection scheme","reliability performance","signal to interference plus noise ratio","SINR analysis","frequency-selective channel","cochannel interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","SIMO","Rician fading","spacial correlation","frequency-selective channel","co-channel interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2014.177","publicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990415/6994949/06995147.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2014.177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale SIMO Systems Based on Specular Component in Correlated Rician Fading Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale SIMO Systems Based on Specular Component in Correlated Rician Fading Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995147/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6995147/","accessionNumber":"14838288","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale SIMO Systems Based on Specular Component in Correlated Rician Fading Environments","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"6575a840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076762S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990415","isNumber":"6994949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990415","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6994949","articleId":"6995147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6995158,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Lei","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085577226"},{"name":"Chen Song","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Song","id":"37085573893"},{"name":"Taige Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Taige","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085571234"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6575-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6574-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6995158","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":765},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wireless communication","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Baseband","Interpolation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","fading channels","OFDM modulation","phase noise","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM link","LabVIEW","USRP","fourth generation mobile communication","channel fading","spectral efficiency","phase noise","carrier frequency offset","interference information","OFDM signal transmissio n"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Defined Radio","LabVIEW","USRP2","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"OFDM has been the core technology of the fourth generation mobile communication due to its strong ability to resist channel fading and high spectral efficiency. However, phase noise and carrier frequency offset often leads to a loss of orthogonality among the sub-carriers, which will affect the performance of the system. The traditional theory simulation lacks the interference information of practical channel. In this paper, we combine the simulation theory and physical research platform to evaluate OFDM link performance using LabVIEW and USRP.

Both the transceiver-to relay channels are assumed to have norm-bounded channel estimation errors. The worst case of the problem in a norm defined error set is optimized to guarantee the performance of the actual case. The resultant beam forming problem minimizes the worst-case total relay transmit power subject to the constraints of quality of service (QoS) of both receivers. We show that the robust beam forming problem can be formulated to a second-order-cone programming (SOCP) problem and can be solved efficiently using interior point method. Simulation results show that the proposed robust beam forming method guarantees no QoS outage at the price of 2 dB of total relay transmit power.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2014.204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994949","startPage":"968","endPage":"973","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990415/6994949/06995174.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst-Case Based Robust Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6995174/","displayDocTitle":"Worst-Case Based Robust Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way Relay Networks","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838344","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst-Case Based Robust Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way Relay Networks","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"6575a968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060104S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990415","isNumber":"6994949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990415","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6994949","articleId":"6995174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6995177,"authors":[{"name":"Hanfeng Wang","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hanfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085472801"},{"name":"Xiaohua Bao","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Bao","id":"37553422700"},{"name":"Chong Di","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Di","id":"37085469433"},{"name":"Zhiheng Cheng","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhiheng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085546035"},{"name":"Yong Fang","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Fang","id":"38467341300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6575-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6574-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6995177","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current density","Induction motors","Rotors","Underwater vehicles","Resistance","Finite element analysis","Current distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current density","current distribution","electromagnetic forces","equivalent circuits","finite element analysis","Maxwell equations","squirrel cage motors","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["submersible motor end ring current analysis","finite element method","electromagnetic force","Maxwell equation","equivalent circuit","current density","radical width","axial width","current distribution","squirrel cage induction motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["submersible","finite-element","end ring","current distribution"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the current in the end ring of a submersible motor is studied by finite-element method.

Each user requests cloud computing system for use of resources. If the system is busy, then user needs to wait until current user finishes the job. This may result in waiting time increase and drop of request Thus, cloud computing service provider needs tools to evaluate and reduce waiting and processing times. In the paper, each request is assumed to consist of several independent sub-requests according to the number of virtual cloud servers in the system. All sub-requests of the same request arrive simultaneously and each server receives exactly one sub-request in its queue. One of the main performance measures of cloud computing system is a maximum waiting and processing time of all sub-requests, which is called response time of the request. In order to evaluate this characteristic, we develop a model in terms of queuing system with multiple queues and batch arrivals. We provide algorithm to obtain steady-state probabilities that allow evaluating various performance measures.","doi":"10.1109/MoNeTeC.2014.6995600","publicationTitle":"2014 International Science and Technology Conference (Modern Networking Technologies) (MoNeTeC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Science and Technology Conference (Modern Networking Technologies) (MoNeTeC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975796/6995568/06995600.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MoNeTeC.2014.6995600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6995568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queuing systems with multiple queues and batch arrivals for cloud computing system performance analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995600/","xploreNote":"As originally published there is an error in the title of this conference.

The goal of this algorithm is to minimize the number of ray-surface intersection tests. While the application of space partitioning is rather common in ray tracing EM simulations as well as in computer science, an adaptive multi-level extension of the volumetric space partitioning scheme is proposed here. The multi-level space partitioning algorithm only requires the maximum allowed number of geometric elements inside a volumetric space partition and adaptively creates the space partitioning grid according to the object studied in the simulation, i.e. according to the distribution of geometric elements. The results show that runtimes can easily be reduced by 50% when applying this optimization algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multi-level uniform space partitioning algorithm for high-frequency electromagnetics simulations based on ray tracing","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Numerical Electromagnetic Modeling and Optimization for RF, Microwave, and Terahertz Applications (NEMO)","doi":"10.1109/NEMO.2014.6995667","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Numerical Electromagnetic Modeling and Optimization for RF, Microwave, and Terahertz Applications (NEMO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975673/6995652/06995667.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMO.2014.6995667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6995652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multi-level uniform space partitioning algorithm for high-frequency electromagnetics simulations based on ray tracing","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6995667/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14836546","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multi-level uniform space partitioning algorithm for high-frequency electromagnetics simulations based on ray tracing","confLoc":"Pavia, Italy","sourcePdf":"129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049497S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975673","isNumber":"6995652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6995652","articleId":"6995667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6995713,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes A.

Toward this, utilization of the Q/V band and an exploitation of multiple gateways (GWs) as a transmit diversity measure for overcoming severe propagation effects are being considered. In this context, this contribution deals with the design of a feeder link comprising N+P GWs (N active and P redundant GWs). Toward provisioning the desired availability, a novel switching scheme is analyzed and practical aspects such as prediction-based switching and switching rate are discussed. Unlike most relevant works, a dynamic rain attenuation model is used to analytically derive average outage probability in the fundamental 1 + 1 GW case. Building on this result, an analysis for the N+P scenario leading to a quantification of the end-to-end performance is provided. This analysis aids system sizing by illustrating the interplay between the number of active and redundant GWs on the chosen metrics: average outage and average switching rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Gateway Transmit Diversity in Q/V Band Feeder Links","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385703","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7060754/06995937.pdf","startPage":"916","endPage":"926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7060754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Gateway Transmit Diversity in Q/V Band Feeder Links","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6995937/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14983003","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Fund, Luxembourg","grantNumber":"5779106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Gateway Transmit Diversity in Q/V Band Feeder Links","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gharanjik-2385703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075921S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7060754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7060754","articleId":"6995937","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6995956,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochun Cao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7297778/6995956/cao-2376938-small.gif","p":["Xiaochun Cao (SM\u201914) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Beihang University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA, all in computer science.","He was a Research Scientist at ObjectVideo, Inc., Reston, VA, USA, for three years.

Wild human faces vary with the poses, expressions, and illumination changes. All kinds of noises, like block occlusions, random pixel corruptions, and various disguises may also destroy the consistency of faces referring to the same person. This motivates us to develop a robust face clustering algorithm that is less sensitive to these noises. To retain the underlying structured information within facial images, we use tensors to represent faces, and then accomplish the clustering task based on the tensor data. The proposed algorithm is called robust tensor clustering (RTC), which firstly finds a lower-rank approximation of the original tensor data using a L1 norm optimization function. Because L1 norm does not exaggerate the effect of noises compared with L2 norm, the minimization of the L1 norm approximation function makes RTC robust. Then, we compute high-order singular value decomposition of this approximate tensor to obtain the final clustering results. Different from traditional algorithms solving the approximation function with a greedy strategy, we utilize a nongreedy strategy to obtain a better solution. Experiments conducted on the benchmark facial datasets and gait sequences demonstrate that RTC has better performance than the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and is more robust to noises.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2376938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7297778/06995956.pdf","startPage":"2546","endPage":"2557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7297778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2376938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Face Clustering Via Tensor Decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust Face Clustering Via Tensor Decomposition","volume":"45","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15520745","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","pubMedId":"25546869","htmlLink":"/document/6995956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422213, 61332012, 61202166 and 61472276"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329305"},{"fundingName":"100 Talents Programme of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20120032120042"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Face Clustering Via Tensor Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wei-2376938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118766S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7297778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7297778","articleId":"6995956","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6995962,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Huang","affiliation":["Asset Management Department, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37597436600"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Teaching Affair Office, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088404872"},{"name":"Weifeng Zhao","affiliation":["Asset Management Department, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Weifeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085485820"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6995962","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Grid Multiwing Butterfly Chaotic Attractors and Their Circuit Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaotic communication","Hysteresis","Bifurcation","Circuit synthesis","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bifurcation","Lyapunov methods","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid multiwing butterfly chaotic attractor","electronic circuit design","piecewise hysteresis function","state variable","Lorenz system","Lyapunov exponent","bifurcation diagram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chaos","Lorenz system","grid multi-wing butterfly chaotic attractors","circuit design"]},{"kwd":["Chaos","circuit design","grid multiwing butterfly chaotic attractors","Lorenz system"]}],"abstract":"A new method is presented generating grid multiwing butterfly chaotic attractors in this brief.

We first establish a holistic power dissipation model for OFDMA systems, including the transmission power, signal processing power, and circuit power from both the transmitter and receiver sides, while existing works only consider the one side power consumption and also fail to capture the impact of subcarriers and users on the system EE. The EE maximization problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional problem that is NP-hard. To make it tractable, we transform the problem of fractional form into a subtractive-form one by using the Dinkelbach transformation and then propose a joint optimization method, which leads to the asymptotically optimal solution. To reduce the computational complexity, we decompose the joint optimization into two consecutive steps, where the key idea lies in exploring the inherent fractional structure of the introduced individual EE and the system EE. In addition, we provide a sufficient condition under which our proposed two-step method is optimal. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methods, and the effect of imperfect channel state information is also characterized.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06995966.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Joint Transmitter and Receiver Energy Efficiency Maximization in Downlink OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Joint Transmitter and Receiver Energy Efficiency Maximization in Downlink OFDMA Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995966/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14930618","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6995966/","volume":"63","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973 Project","grantNumber":"2012CB316106"},{"fundingName":"NSF China","grantNumber":"61161130529, 61328101, 61322102 and 61329101"},{"fundingName":"STCSM Science and Technology Innovation Program","grantNumber":"13510711200"},{"fundingName":"SEU National Key Laboratory on Mobile Communications","grantNumber":"2013D11"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Joint Transmitter and Receiver Energy Efficiency Maximization in Downlink OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-2385705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115556S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6995966","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6995967,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Feng","affiliation":["iPack Vinn Excellence Center, School of Information and Communication Technology, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7086408/6995967/feng-2385154-small.gif","p":["Yi Feng received the B.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2005.

The sensing performances of three paper substrates, including commercial packaging paper, are investigated. The use of paper provides excellent sensitivity and reasonable response time to humidity. The cheap and robust packaging paper, particularly, exhibits the largest sensitivity over the relative humidity range from 20% to 70%, which offers the possibility of directly printing the sensor tag on traditional packages to make the package intelligent at ultralow cost.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2385154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7086408/06995967.pdf","startPage":"3201","endPage":"3208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2385154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Cost Printed Chipless RFID Humidity Sensor Tag for Intelligent Packaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995967/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Cost Printed Chipless RFID Humidity Sensor Tag for Intelligent Packaging","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15057696","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6995967/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Government Agency for Innovation Systems through the Vinn Excellence Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Cost Printed Chipless RFID Humidity Sensor Tag for Intelligent Packaging","sourcePdf":"jsen-feng-2385154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092726S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7086408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"7086408","articleId":"6995967","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6995972,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Xu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Kai Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"38247577700"},{"name":"Hang Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Wong","id":"37280423700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6995972","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3380},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric resonator antennas","Dielectrics","Bandwidth","Broadband antennas","Antenna measurements","Feeds","Reflection coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","dielectric resonator antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotated-stair dielectric resonator","wideband compact circularly polarized dielectric resonator antenna","DRA","rectangular dielectric layers","adjacent bottom layer","dual broadside CP radiating modes","AR bandwidth","CP bandwidth broadening technique","5G Wi-Fi","satellite communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperture coupled","circular polarization (CP)","dielectric resonator antenna","rotated-stair DRA","wide bandwidth"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a wideband compact circularly polarized (CP) dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) is proposed.

The rotated-stair configuration of DRA contributes dual broadside CP radiating modes and results in a noticeable enhancement in the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth. The proposed antenna achieves 31% impedance bandwidth and 18.2% AR bandwidth. The average gain within the AR bandwidth is 4.5 dBi with less than 0.5-dB variation.

Recently, the chemical reaction optimization (CRO) method has proved to be very effective in many fields. In this paper, an improved hybrid version of the CRO method called HCRO (hybrid CRO) is developed for solving the DAG-based task scheduling problem. In HCRO, the CRO method is integrated with the novel heuristic approaches, and a new selection strategy is proposed. More specifically, the following contributions are made in this paper. (1) A Gaussian random walk approach is proposed to search for optimal local candidate solutions. (2) A left or right rotating shift method based on the theory of maximum Hamming distance is used to guarantee that our HCRO algorithm can escape from local optima. (3) A novel selection strategy based on the normal distribution and a pseudo-random shuffle approach are developed to keep the molecular diversity. Moreover, an exclusive-OR (XOR) operator between two strings is introduced to reduce the chance of cloning before new molecules are generated. Both simulation and real-life experiments have been conducted in this paper to verify the effectiveness of HCRO. The results show that the HCRO algorithm schedules the DAG tasks much better than the existing algorithms in terms of makespan and speed of convergence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2015","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6995978/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15587654","volume":"26","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Chemical Reaction Optimization Scheme for Task Scheduling on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61133005 and 61432005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370095, 61472124, 61202109 and 61472126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Chemical Reaction Optimization Scheme for Task Scheduling on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-xu-2385698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107575S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7323921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7323921","articleId":"6995978","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6995980,"authors":[{"name":"Barry P.

A predictive database is created and applied to forecast future network states in order to allow short-term (e.g., hours/days ahead) planning to be carried out. The predictive database is based on adaptive nonlinear auto-regressive exogenous (NARX) load estimation and forecasting models, which are continuously updated using feedback from the state estimator. This creates a closed-loop information flow designed to continuously monitor and improve the system state estimation performance by updating and retraining models where appropriate. The aim of this methodology is to improve situational awareness and help to provide network operators with early warning of potential issues, in medium voltage (MV) networks where the number of on-line measurements is limited, and state estimation relies heavily on estimates of power injections. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated through simulation using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and smart meter measurements recorded from an actual MV distribution network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6995980/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15234593","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Closed-Loop State Estimation Tool for MV Network Monitoring and Operation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission through the Marie Curie Researcher Mobility Action","grantNumber":"FP7-PEOPLE-2013-COFUND"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"Smart HG Research Project","grantNumber":"FP7-ICT-2011-8"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Closed-Loop State Estimation Tool for MV Network Monitoring and Operation","sourcePdf":"tsg-hayes-2378035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063253S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7128463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7128463","articleId":"6995980","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6995983,"authors":[{"name":"Jafar Alvankarian","affiliation":["Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics, National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/7073672/6995983/alvan-2378314-small.gif","p":["Jafar Alvankarian received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in aerospace engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in microengineering from the Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics (IMEN), National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia, in 2013.

Determining the impact of the nonuniformity in strain on the geometry and performance of such a planar device under in-plane stretch is the motivation for this study. A semiempirical model is used to explain the physical strain-stress behavior from the root to the tip of the micropillars in the linear arrays in the device. For microfabrication of the device, the main substrate is elastomeric polyurethane methacrylate, which is utilized in an ultraviolet-molding method. Optical imaging and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the deformation of the microstructures under different loading conditions. It was demonstrated that by applying mechanical strains of <;20% (\u0394L/L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sub>\n) on the elastomeric device using a modified syringe pump, the spacing of the pillars is increased effectively to about three times the size of the initial setting of 5.5 \u03bcm, which corresponds to a strain of above 180% in the absence of nonuniformity effects. This simple yet interesting behavior can be exploited to rapidly adjust a microfluidic device for application to the separation of microbeads or blood cells, which would normally require the geometrical redesign and fabrication of a new device.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consideration of Nonuniformity in Elongation of Microstructures in a Mechanically Tunable Microfluidic Device for Size-Based Isolation of Microparticles","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2378314","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/84/7073672/06995983.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2378314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6995983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6995983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Consideration of Nonuniformity in Elongation of Microstructures in a Mechanically Tunable Microfluidic Device for Size-Based Isolation of Microparticles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6995983/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15035658","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia through the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia","grantNumber":"DIP-2012-16 and NND/ND/41/TD11-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consideration of Nonuniformity in Elongation of Microstructures in a Mechanically Tunable Microfluidic Device for Size-Based Isolation of Microparticles","sourcePdf":"jmems-alvankarian-2378314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098448S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"7073672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7073672","articleId":"6995983","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6995992,"authors":[{"name":"Miu Yoong Leong","affiliation":["Acreo Swedish ICT AB, Stockholm, Sweden","KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Miu Yoong","lastName":"Leong","id":"37085525183"},{"name":"Knud J.

For real-time embedded systems, worst case execution time (WCET) is more important than average-case performance. We address the problem of allocating program data variables between main memory and SPM to minimize the energy consumption due to data variable accesses, while respecting a given upper bound on a program's WCET. We present an optimal branch-and-bound algorithm; and an efficient heuristic algorithm. Our approach provides a flexible framework for the designer to perform tradeoff analysis between the program WCET and the energy consumption based on application requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553538","htmlLink":"/document/6996006/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"WCET-Aware Energy-Efficient Data Allocation on Scratchpad Memory for Real-Time Embedded Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272127"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WCET-Aware Energy-Efficient Data Allocation on Scratchpad Memory for Real-Time Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-gu-2379635-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05945S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6996006","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6996007,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsub Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7027925/6996007/6996007-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsub Kim (M'14) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering with minors in applied mathematics and statistics from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.","He is an Assistant Professor of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis.

Attack techniques proposed in the literature often require detailed knowledge of system parameters. Such information is difficult to acquire in practice. The subspace methods presented in this paper, on the other hand, learn the system operating subspace from measurements and launch attacks accordingly. Conditions for the existence of an unobservable subspace attack are obtained under the full and partial measurement models. Using the estimated system subspace, two attack strategies are presented. The first strategy aims to affect the system state directly by hiding the attack vector in the system subspace. The second strategy misleads the bad data detection mechanism so that data not under attack are removed. Performance of these attacks are evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus network and the IEEE 118-bus network.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7027925/6996007-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996007/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2015","volume":"63","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14914716","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","publicationDate":"March1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6996007/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Subspace Methods for Data Attack on State Estimation: A Data Driven Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1135844"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Subspace Methods for Data Attack on State Estimation: A Data Driven Approach","sourcePdf":"tsp-kim-2385670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136937S","chronDate":"March1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7027925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"7027925","articleId":"6996007","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6996011,"authors":[{"name":"Pi-Feng Chiu","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pi-Feng","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37085554698"},{"name":"Borivoje Nikoli\u0107","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Borivoje","lastName":"Nikoli\u0107","id":"37268296200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6996011","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":742},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996011","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Leakage currents","Resistance","Microprocessors","Nonvolatile memory","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","leakage currents","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential 2R crosspoint RRAM array","zero standby current","memory power consumption","nonvolatile memory devices","memory leakage current","resistive random access memory","crosspoint structure","array segmentation","sense-before-write techniques","energy efficiency","mobile computing","size 28 nm","size 32 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRAM","memristor","nonvolatile memory","crosspoint","cache","zero standby current"]},{"kwd":["Cache","crosspoint","memristor","nonvolatile memory (NVM)","resistive random access memory (RRAM)","zero standby current"]}],"abstract":"Memory power consumption dominates mobile system energy budgets in scaled technologies.

Approaches based on multiporting and virtually pipelined architectures, which have been studied in static random access memory (SRAM)/dynamic random access memory (DRAM)/hybrid-SRAM/DRAM memory systems for high throughput performance, provide an attractive means to overcome these challenges through innovations spanning the memory cell to architecture levels. This paper describes a virtually pipelined memory architecture built on a two-port phase change memory (PCM) substrate for high-performance networking applications. The proposed two-port PCM cell significantly reduces the probability of bank conflicts due to blocking writes. We comprehensively evaluate the two-port cell design in terms of programming current, voltage pumping for access transistors, and area overhead. We also propose a two-port PCM bank design to provide the large bandwidth and bank parallelism critical for high-performance networking applications. Furthermore, the virtually pipelined architecture is implemented at the memory controller level, eliminating the extra delay of read requests due to the asymmetrical access latency through separate reservation tables for read and write requests. We analyze the performance of this architecture using queuing theory and statistical information obtained by processing packet traces using PacketBench, and show that the proposed innovations can reduce the expected read (write) delay by 12-$40\\times $ (up to 14%) over conventional single-port PCM for 110%-170% additional area.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2360801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7274516/06996019.pdf","startPage":"2135","endPage":"2148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2360801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Port PCM Architecture for Network Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996019","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/7274516/6996019-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Two-Port PCM Architecture for Network Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996019/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15475024","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996019/","volume":"23","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CCF-1208933"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1217738"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Two-Port PCM Architecture for Network Processing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mohanram-2360801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090875S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7274516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"7274516","articleId":"6996019","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6996020,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxing Yang","affiliation":["Intelligent Computation and Its Applications (UBRI), University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaoxing Yang received the B.S. degree in computer science from School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2007.

Existing software defect prediction models that are optimized to predict explicitly the number of defects in a software module might fail to give an accurate order because it is very difficult to predict the exact number of defects in a software module due to noisy data. This paper introduces a learning-to-rank approach to construct software defect prediction models by directly optimizing the ranking performance. In this paper, we build on our previous work, and further study whether the idea of directly optimizing the model performance measure can benefit software defect prediction model construction. The work includes two aspects: one is a novel application of the learning-to-rank approach to real-world data sets for software defect prediction, and the other is a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the learning-to-rank method against other algorithms that have been used for predicting the order of software modules according to the predicted number of defects. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of directly optimizing the model performance measure for the learning-to-rank approach to construct defect prediction models for the ranking task.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7051309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2014.2370891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/7051309/06996020.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"246","doi":"10.1109/TR.2014.2370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Learning-to-Rank Approach to Software Defect Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Learning-to-Rank Approach to Software Defect Prediction","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6996020/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14948517","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Learning-to-Rank Approach to Software Defect Prediction","sourcePdf":"tr-yang-2370891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109891S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"7051309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7051309","articleId":"6996020","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6996021,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas O.

This method is named compressed nonbinary message passing (CNBMP). CNBMP reduces the number of messages exchanged between one check node and the connected variable nodes from dc x q to 5 \u00d7 q, and its application has a high impact on the performance of the decoder: the storage and routing areas are reduced and the throughput is increased. Unlike other methods, CNBMP does not introduce any approximation or modification in the information and the processed operations are exactly the same as those of the original decoders; hence, no performance degradation is introduced. To demonstrate its advantages, an architecture applying this CNBMP to the Trellis Min-Max algorithm was derived showing that most of the storage resources were also reduced from d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n \u00d7 q to 5 \u00d7 q.

Simulation results show that the proposed design increases read static noise margin and ION/IOFF of read path by 219% and 113%, respectively, at supply voltage of 300-mV over conventional 6T SRAM cell in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The proposed design lets us reduce the minimum operating voltage of SRAM (VDDmin) to 350 mV, whereas conventional 6T SRAM cannot operate successfully with an acceptable failure rate at supply voltages below 725 mV. We also compared our design with three other SRAM cells from recent literature. To verify the proposed design, a 256-kb SRAM is designed using new 9T and conventional 6T SRAM cells. Operating at their minimum possible VDDs, the proposed design decreases write and read power per operation by 92% and 93%, respectively, over the conventional rival. The area of the proposed SRAM cell is increased by 83% over a conventional 6T one. However, due to large ION/IOFF of read path for 9T cell, we are able to put 1k cells in each column of 256-kb SRAM block, resulting in the possibility for sharing write and read circuitries of each column between more cells compared with conventional 6T. Thus, the area overhead of 256kb SRAM based on new 9T cell is reduced to 37% compared with 6T SRAM.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377518","startPage":"2438","endPage":"2446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7302619/06996023.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 256-kb 9T Near-Threshold SRAM With 1k Cells per Bitline and Enhanced Write and Read Operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A 256-kb 9T Near-Threshold SRAM With 1k Cells per Bitline and Enhanced Write and Read Operations","volume":"23","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553531","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6996023/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 256-kb 9T Near-Threshold SRAM With 1k Cells per Bitline and Enhanced Write and Read Operations","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pasandi-2377518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084093S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6996023","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6996028,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanming Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7017617/6996028/6996028-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanming Shi (S'13) received his B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011.

In this paper, we establish a generic stochastic coordinated beamforming (SCB) framework that provides flexibility in the channel uncertainty modeling, while guaranteeing optimality in the transmission strategies. We adopt a general stochastic model for the CSI uncertainty, which is applicable for various practical scenarios. The SCB problem turns out to be a joint chance constrained program (JCCP) and is known to be highly intractable. In contrast to all of the previous algorithms for JCCP that can only find feasible but sub-optimal solutions, we propose a novel stochastic DC (difference-of-convex) programming algorithm with optimality guarantee, which can serve as the benchmark for evaluating heuristic and sub-optimal algorithms. The key observation is that the highly intractable probability constraint can be equivalently reformulated as a dc constraint. This further enables efficient algorithms to achieve optimality. Simulation results will illustrate the convergence, conservativeness, stability and performance gains of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2385669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7017617/06996028.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2385669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7017617","startPage":"960","endPage":"973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Stochastic Coordinated Beamforming for Wireless Cooperative Networks With CSI Uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Stochastic Coordinated Beamforming for Wireless Cooperative Networks With CSI Uncertainty","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14866841","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6996028/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Stochastic Coordinated Beamforming for Wireless Cooperative Networks With CSI Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tsp-shi-2385669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128025S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7017617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7017617","articleId":"6996028","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6996033,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Santi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7015642/6996033/santi-2373373-small.gif","p":["Enrico Santi (S\u201990\u2013M\u201994\u2013SM\u201902) received the Ph.D. degree from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 1994.","He has been with the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA, since 1998, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Various features and classifiers were explored with the goal of maximizing detection accuracy while minimizing power, area, and latency. Additionally, algorithmic and hardware optimizations were identified to further improve performance. The classifiers studied include $k$-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, na\u00efve Bayes, and logistic regression (LR) . All feature and classifier pairs were able to obtain F1 scores over 80% and onset sensitivity of 100% when tested on ten patients. A fully flexible hardware system was implemented that offers parameters for the number of EEG channels, the number of features, the classifier type, and various word width resolutions. Five seizure detection processors with different classifiers have been fully placed and routed on a Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array and been compared. It was found that five features per channel with LR proved to be the best solution for the application of personalized seizure detection. LR had the best average F1 score of 91%, the smallest area and power footprint, and the lowest latency. The ASIC implementation of the same combination in 65-nm CMOS shows that the processor occupies 0.008 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and dissipates 19 nJ at 484 Hz.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2014.2385211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2014.2385211","startPage":"109","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7035141/06996043.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7035141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible Multichannel EEG Feature Extractor and Classifier for Seizure Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Multichannel EEG Feature Extractor and Classifier for Seizure Detection","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14914782","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6996043/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Multichannel EEG Feature Extractor and Classifier for Seizure Detection","sourcePdf":"tcsii-page-2385211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056547S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7035141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7035141","articleId":"6996043","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6996047,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewook Kang","affiliation":["Department of information and communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7017617/6996047/6996047-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaewook Kang (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in information and communications engineering (2009) from Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, and the M.S. degree in information and communications engineering (2010) from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Republic of Korea.

In this framework, we consider an LDPC-like measurement matrices which has a tree-structured property, and additive white Gaussian noise. BHT-BP has a joint detection-and-estimation structure consisting of a sparse support detector and a nonzero estimator. The support detector is designed under the criterion of the minimum detection error probability using a nonparametric belief propagation (nBP) and composite binary hypothesis tests. The nonzeros are estimated in the sense of linear MMSE, where the support detection result is utilized. BHT-BP has its strength in noise robust support detection, effectively removing quantization errors caused by the uniform sampling-based nBP. Therefore, in the NSR problems, BHT-BP has advantages over CS-BP which is an existing nBP algorithm, being comparable to other recent CS solvers, in several aspects. In addition, we examine impact of the minimum nonzero value of sparse signals via BHT-BP, on the basis of the results.

The majority of mathematic units in the proposed architecture are centralized so that any mathematic unit can be shared with any algorithm. Six advanced instructions are also defined in the ALU: 1) complex multiplication; 2) complex division; 3) correlation; 4) channel estimation; 5) 4 \u00d7 4 matrix inversion; and 6) STBC-based decoding. A scheduler is essential to handle all data paths and signaling flows smoothly with the use of an SIMD ALU. As a result, it is relatively easy to reconfigure the proposed design for different specifications. The very large scale integration implementation of this chip, using an in-house 65-nm CMOS process, consumes a total of 1.87 M gates and draws 33.7 mW at a supply voltage of 1 V.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7333028/06996048.pdf","startPage":"2791","endPage":"2803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7333028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Efficient Frequency-Domain MIMO\u2013OFDM Modem With an SIMD ALU-Based Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modems","Clocks","Correlation","Channel estimation","Synchronization","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","CMOS integrated circuits","logic circuits","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost efficient frequency domain MIMO-OFDM modem","SIMD ALU based architecture","hardware efficiency","frequency domain multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modem","space time block code","STBC","mathematic units","CMOS process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)","cost efficient","modem","multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM)","wireless LAN."]},{"kwd":["Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)","cost efficient","modem","multiple input multiple output\u2013orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO\u2013OFDM)","wireless LAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Efficient Frequency-Domain MIMO\u2013OFDM Modem With an SIMD ALU-Based Architecture","volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6996048/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602896","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Efficient Frequency-Domain MIMO\u2013OFDM Modem With an SIMD ALU-Based Architecture","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-hsu-2377780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077934S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7333028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7333028","articleId":"6996048","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6996050,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Cant\u00f3-Navarro","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7302619/6996050/sanch-2377578-small.gif","p":["Enrique Cant\u00f3-Navarro received the M.S. degree in electronics engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Universidad Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain, in 1995 and 2001, respectively.","He has been an Associate Professor with UPC since 1996 and an Assistant Professor with Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain, since 2003.

With a clock frequency of 40 MHz, the system is capable of executing the complete algorithm in real time, processing a voice frame in 9.1 ms. The same verification process was carried out for two different systems: 1) an ARM Cortex A8 microprocessor; and 2) configuring MicroBlaze with the scalar floating-point unit provided by Xilinx. The experimental results show that when comparing our proposed system against both systems, the number of clock cycles is reduced by a factor of 11.2\u00d7 and 15.4\u00d7, respectively. The main advantage of the VFPU is its flexibility, which allows quick adaptation of the software to the potential changes produced in both the system and the user requirements. The algorithm was tested over a public database that contains the utterances of different users acquired under different environmental conditions, providing good recognition rates.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7302619/06996050.pdf","startPage":"2497","endPage":"2507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302619","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Biometric Online Speaker-Verification System Implemented on FPGA Using Vector Floating-Point Units","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996050/","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Biometric Online Speaker-Verification System Implemented on FPGA Using Vector Floating-Point Units","volume":"23","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996050/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553537","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad within the framework of the Programa Nacional de Proyectos de Investigaci\u00f3n Fundamental","grantNumber":"TEC2012-38329-C02-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Biometric Online Speaker-Verification System Implemented on FPGA Using Vector Floating-Point Units","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-rafael-2377578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085322S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6996050","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6996053,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Tamburello","affiliation":["Leidos, Arlington, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7017617/6996053/6996053-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Philip Tamburello received the B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, in 1996 and 1997, respectively.","He is currently a Signal Engineer at Leidos.

In this paper we examine the robustness of two estimators of correlation based on memoryless nonlinear functions of the observations, the Median-of-Ratios Estimator (MRE) and the Phase-Phase Correlator (PPC), which are applicable to complex-valued Gaussian random processes. We show that they are robust to impulsive noise from a bias perspective at the expense of statistical efficiency at the Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we develop iterative versions of these estimators named the IMRE and IPPC, realizing an improved bias performance over their non-iterative counterparts and the well-known robust Schweppe-type Generalized M-estimator utilizing a Huber cost function (SHGM). We use robust Mahalanobis distances generated by the IMRE and IPPC to improve the performance of impulsive noise suppression through the use of weighted basis pursuit methods. These estimation and data-cleaning techniques are applied to both synthetic and actual collected data using an Ettus Research USRP to perform robust spectral estimation on signals from the digital television band in the presence of additive impulsive noise. Finally, the analysis reveals that if the time series is highly correlated and the contamination rate is low, the MRE outperforms the PPC estimator from a variance and bias perspective. However, the PPC is the estimator of choice when the correlation is lower and is better suited to time critical applications due to lower computation costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14866844","htmlLink":"/document/6996053/","displayDocTitle":"New Robust Estimators of Correlation and Weighted Basis Pursuit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Robust Estimators of Correlation and Weighted Basis Pursuit","sourcePdf":"tsp-tamburello-2385664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069384S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7017617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7017617","articleId":"6996053","onlineDate":"23 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6996088,"authors":[{"name":"Madurakavi Karthikeyan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Pondicherry Engineering College, Puducherry, India"],"firstName":"Madurakavi","lastName":"Karthikeyan","id":"38242756200"},{"name":"D Saraswady","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Pondicherry Engineering College, Puducherry, India"],"firstName":"D","lastName":"Saraswady","id":"37085366081"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4989-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4990-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996088","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Measurement","MIMO","Lattices","Maximum likelihood decoding","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","MIMO communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity reduction","noise statistics","pruning probability","ML solution","SE enumeration","probabilistic threshold","MIMO decoding","multiple-input multiple-output decoding","TSE SD","TSE sphere decoder","MIMO system","threshold-based Schnorr-Euchner enumeration","sphere decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sphere Decoding","Threshold based SE","Schnorr-Euchner Enumeration","MIMO","ML Decoding"]}],"abstract":"A threshold based Schnorr-Euchner (TSE) sphere decoder (SD) is presented in this paper to reduce the high computational burden incur in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) decoding.

Traditional architectures for cognitive radio networks (CRNs), such as cognitive cellular networks and cognitive ad hoc networks, impose energy-consuming cognitive radios to SUs' devices for communication and cannot efficiently utilize the spectrum harvested from the primary users (PUs). To enhance the spectrum and energy efficiencies of CRNs, we have designed a new architecture, which is called the Cognitive Capacity Harvesting network (CCH). In CCH, a collection of relay stations (RSs) with cognitive capability are deployed to facilitate the accessing of SUs. In this way, the architecture not only removes the requirement of cognitive radios from SUs and reduces their energy consumption, but also increases frequency reuse and enhances spectrum efficiency. In view of the importance of the RSs on the improvement of spectrum and energy efficiencies, in this paper, we study the RS placement strategy in CCH. We design a framework of heuristic algorithms to compute the near-optimal solutions. The simulation result show that the proposed algorithms outperform the random placement strategy and is always within 2 times of that in the optimal solution.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996087","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979786/6996087/06996089.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraint-based relay station placement in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996089/","displayDocTitle":"Constraint-based relay station placement in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14837214","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint-based relay station placement in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"10184ConstraintBasedRelayStationPlac.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076474S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979786","isNumber":"6996087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979786","xplore-issue":"6996087","articleId":"6996089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6996092,"authors":[{"name":"Kirthanaa Raghuraman","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Kirthanaa","lastName":"Raghuraman","id":"37085427884"},{"name":"Monisha Senthurpandian","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Monisha","lastName":"Senthurpandian","id":"37085481482"},{"name":"Monisha Shanmugasundaram","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Monisha","lastName":"Shanmugasundaram","id":"37085481970"},{"name":"Bhargavi","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"lastName":"Bhargavi","id":"37085487521"},{"name":"V.

In this paper, in order to process the health data in an online fashion a novel Online Incremental Learning Algorithm (OILA) is proposed. The OILA predicts the health parameters using a regression based approach with a feedback mechanism to reduce error. An alert is generated when an anomaly is seen in the health parameters, thus alerting the doctor to be cautious. The algorithm is compared with Kalman Filter for comparing the prediction capabilities of OILA with Kalman Filter. The proposed algorithm is validated with real time health parameter data sets for health parameters namely heart rate and blood pressure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996087","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979786/6996087/06996092.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996092","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Incremental Learning Algorithm for anomaly detection and prediction in health care","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996092/","displayDocTitle":"Online Incremental Learning Algorithm for anomaly detection and prediction in health care","htmlLink":"/document/6996092/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14837244","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Incremental Learning Algorithm for anomaly detection and prediction in health care","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"102610OnlineIncrementalLearningAlgor.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093899S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979786","isNumber":"6996087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979786","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6996087","articleId":"6996092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6996110,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37061961600"},{"name":"Ryoichi Shinkuma","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoichi","lastName":"Shinkuma","id":"37296517700"},{"name":"Tatsuro Takahashi","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuro","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277759600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-288-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996110","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile nodes","Resource management","Mobile handsets","Nickel","Bandwidth","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","resource allocation","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic resource sharing","mobile devices","smart phones","wearable devices","smart vehicles","resources utilization","mobile networks","information networks","cooperation based architecture","mobile cloud computing","MCC","resource sharing mechanism","opportunistic contacts"]}],"abstract":"Modern mobile devices (smart phones, wearable devices, and smart vehicles) have greater resources (communication, computation, and sensing) than before, and these resources are not always fully utilized by device users. Therefore, mobile devices, from time to time, encounter other devices that could provide resources to them. Because the amount of such resources has increased with the number of mobile devices, researchers have begun to consider making use of these resources, located at the \u201cedge\u201d of mobile networks, to increase the scalability of future information networks. This has led to a cooperation based architecture of mobile cloud computing (MCC).

In this paper, we propose an efficient fast search ME method for one bit transform to reduce computations involved in determining motion of blocks in a frame. The proposed Fast search algorithm effectively estimates the motion information in video.

The thresholds are calculated according to the noise uncertainty at each secondary user. Here, we have worked on and analyzed the results of traditional energy detector in a noise uncertain environment using double threshold with the aid of co-operative sensing. The unsuitability of the traditional energy detector is observed from the analysis and we propose a dual threshold based optimum power energy detection algorithm suitable under noise uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996150","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979786/6996087/06996150.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996150","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement using optimum power energy detector under noise uncertain environment in cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement using optimum power energy detector under noise uncertain environment in cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996150/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996150/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14837230","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement using optimum power energy detector under noise uncertain environment in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"39534PerformanceImprovementusingOpti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05049S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979786","isNumber":"6996087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979786","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6996087","articleId":"6996150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6996177,"authors":[{"name":"Ragini","affiliation":["Division of Cyber Laws & Information Security, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, Allahabad, U.

Although data security and privacy have been the major concern to the users. These issues originated from the fact that the cloud is a semi-trusted environment and the sensitive information stored in the cloud can be accessed by any unauthorized person. Thus, new methods and models are needed to solve the problem of privacy and security of data owner. In this paper, we attempt to address the concern of privacy and security of data owner. We first present a Mobility Node Model (MNM) where mobile client is coming from the external environment to the organization. Here data owner provides access of cloud data to mobile client via proxy server without revealing its identity. Second we propose a Centralized Owner Model (COM) as a centralized control mechanism which generates, key, group member details and mobile client accessibility for external and internal environment. Here request of mobile client is propagated via Trusted Leader to achieve optimality in terms of minimizing computation and communication overheads. The analysis of our proposed models demonstrate the efficiency to achieve the privacy and security in mobile cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996177","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979786/6996087/06996177.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996087","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient model for privacy and security in Mobile Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient model for privacy and security in Mobile Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996177/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14837247","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996177/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient model for privacy and security in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"63466AnEfficientModelforPrivacyandSe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04564S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979786","isNumber":"6996087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979786","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6996087","articleId":"6996177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6996195,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) approach is one of the effective methods for pose and illumination invariant face recognition. However, it is very difficult for the 3DMM to recover the illumination of the 2D input image because the ratio of the albedo and illumination contributions in a pixel intensity is ambiguous. Unlike the traditional idea of separating the albedo and illumination contributions using a 3DMM, we propose a novel Albedo Based 3D Morphable Model (AB3DMM), which removes the illumination component from the images using illumination normalisation in a preprocessing step. A comparative study of different illumination normalisation methods for this step is conducted on PIE and Multi-PIE databases. The results show that overall performance of our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust face recognition by an albedo based 3D morphable model","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996223.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust face recognition by an albedo based 3D morphable model","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996223/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838111","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust face recognition by an albedo based 3D morphable model","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCB2014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092428S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6996224,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Gottschlich","affiliation":["Institute for Mathematical Stochastics, University of Gottingen"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Gottschlich","id":"38072908300"},{"name":"Emanuela Marasco","affiliation":["Lane Department CSEE, West Virginia University"],"firstName":"Emanuela","lastName":"Marasco","id":"37596191600"},{"name":"Allen Y.

Most current mitigation approaches rely upon the fingerprint liveness detection as the main anti-spoofing mechanisms. However, liveness detection algorithms are not robust to sensor variations. In other words, typical liveness detection algorithms need to be retrained and adapted to each and every sensor used for fingerprint capture. In this paper, inspired by popular invariant feature descriptors such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), we propose a new invariant descriptor of fingerprint ridge texture called histograms of invariant gradients (HIG). The proposed descriptor is designed to preserve robustness to variations in gradient positions. Spoofed fingerprints are detected using multiple histograms of invariant gradients computed from spatial neighborhoods within the fingerprint. Results show that proposed method achieves an average accuracy comparable to the best algorithms of the Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2013, while being applicable with no change to multiple acquisition sensors.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996224","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996224.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996224/","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint liveness detection based on histograms of invariant gradients","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838103","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996224/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint liveness detection based on histograms of invariant gradients","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCBMarasco.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088381S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6996229,"authors":[{"name":"Renu Sharma","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India","Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Renu","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37070517800"},{"name":"Sukhendu Das","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India"],"firstName":"Sukhendu","lastName":"Das","id":"38598892900"},{"name":"Padmaja Joshi","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Padmaja","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37070528200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3584-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996229","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Dictionaries","Face","Testing","Vectors","Lighting","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictation","face recognition","image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionary based framework","face recognition","single training sample","STS","degraded set","DS","data dictionary","training dictionary","intra-class variation dictionary","query image","AR datasets","LFW datasets"]}],"abstract":"Availability of a single training sample (STS) or degraded set (DS) of training and testing samples restricts the success of face recognition in real-world applications.

Misalignment of the query image is handled by aligning it with respect to the representative samples. A few moderately aligned and warped face images obtained from the query image are then sparsely represented using the data dictionary with additional constraints on their variance which reduces the obligation of a perfectly aligned query image. The experiments results on AR and LFW datasets validate our claim of superior performance in STS and DS as compared to the other recent methods.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996229","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996229.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dictionary based framework for face recognition, designed mutually for single training sample (STS) and degraded set (DS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996229/","displayDocTitle":"Dictionary based framework for face recognition, designed mutually for single training sample (STS) and degraded set (DS)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838136","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996229/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dictionary based framework for face recognition, designed mutually for single training sample (STS) and degraded set (DS)","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059531S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6996238,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Moutafis","affiliation":["Computational Biomedicine Lab Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, TX"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Moutafis","id":"37076060000"},{"name":"Ioannis A.

Specifically, we focus on the problem of comparing a low-resolution (LR) image with a high-resolution (HR) one. Existing coupled mapping methods do not fully exploit the HR information or they do not simultaneously use samples from both domains during training. To this end, we propose a method that learns coupled distance metrics in two steps. In addition, we propose to jointly learn two semi-coupled bases that yield optimal representations. In particular, the HR images are used to learn a basis and a distance metric that result in increased class-separation. The LR images are then used to learn a basis and a distance metric that map the LR data to their class-discriminated HR pairs. Finally, the two distance metrics are refined to simultaneously enhance the class-separation of both HR class-discriminated and LR projected images. We illustrate that different distance metric learning approaches can be employed in conjunction with our framework. Experimental results on Multi-PIE and SCface, along with the relevant hypothesis tests, provide evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996238","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996238.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-coupled basis and distance metric learning for cross-domain matching: Application to low-resolution face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996238/","displayDocTitle":"Semi-coupled basis and distance metric learning for cross-domain matching: Application to low-resolution face recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838075","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996238/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-coupled basis and distance metric learning for cross-domain matching: Application to low-resolution face recognition","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"paper117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094166S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6996240,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Ferrara","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Cesena, FC, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Ferrara","id":"37408613100"},{"name":"Annalisa Franco","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Cesena, FC, Italy"],"firstName":"Annalisa","lastName":"Franco","id":"37271696200"},{"name":"Davide Maltoni","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Cesena, FC, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Maltoni","id":"37267343500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3584-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996240","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Software","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","computer crime","document handling","fraud"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magic passport","e-mail","police","banner"]}],"abstract":"Once upon a time there was a criminal; he was reading his e-mail when a banner caught his attention: low cost flights for the destination of his dreams!

In this paper we present a new technique for biometric key generation from free-text keystroke dynamics. This is the first technique suitable for continuous key generation. Our approach is based on a scaled parity code for key generation (and subsequent key reconstruction), and can be augmented with the use of population data to improve security and reduce key reconstruction error. In particular, we rely on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to obtain a better representation of discriminable biometric signals. To update the LDA matrix without disclosing user's biometric information, we design a provably secure privacy-preserving protocol (PP-LDA) based on homomorphic encryption. Our biometric key generation with PP-LDA was evaluated on a dataset of 486 users. We report equal error rate around 5% when using LDA, and below 7% without LDA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Protocols","Vectors","Measurement","Feature extraction","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cryptographic protocols","private key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving population-enhanced biometric key generation","cryptographic material generation","free-text keystroke dynamics","continuous key generation","scaled parity code","key reconstruction","population data","security improvement","key reconstruction error reduction","linear discriminant analysis","LDA matrix update","discriminable biometric signal representation","user biometric information","provably secure privacy- preserving protocol","homomorphic encryption","PP-LDA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996244","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996244","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996244","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-preserving population-enhanced biometric key generation from free-text keystroke dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-preserving population-enhanced biometric key generation from free-text keystroke dynamics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996244/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996244/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838090","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-preserving population-enhanced biometric key generation from free-text keystroke dynamics","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"paper135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07206S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":6996248,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Dutta","affiliation":["University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37085550197"},{"name":"Raymond Veldhuis","affiliation":["University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Veldhuis","id":"37296440200"},{"name":"Luuk Spreeuwers","affiliation":["University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Luuk","lastName":"Spreeuwers","id":"37296661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3584-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996248","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Predictive models","Image quality","Lighting","Probes","Data models","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","decision making","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian model","face recognition performance prediction","facial image quality","Bayesian approach","MultiPIE data set","image quality information","decision threshold"]}],"abstract":"Quality of a pair of facial images is a strong indicator of the uncertainty in decision about identity based on that image pair.

With the advance of face detection algorithms, a natural solution is to blur or block facial regions in visual data so as to obscure identity information. Such solutions however often destroy privacy-insensitive information and hence limit the data utility, e.g., gender and age information. In this paper we address the de-identification problem by proposing a simple yet effective framework, named GARP-Face, that balances utility preservation in face deidentification. In particular, we use modern facial analysis technologies to determine the Gender, Age, and Race attributes of facial images, and Preserving these attributes by seeking corresponding representatives constructed through a gallery dataset. We evaluate the proposed approach using the MORPH dataset in comparison with several state-of-the-art face de-identification solutions. The results show that our method outperforms previous solutions in preserving data utility while achieving similar degree of privacy protection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996249.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GARP-face: Balancing privacy protection and utility preservation in face de-identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Privacy","Data privacy","Active appearance model","Visualization","Probes","Videos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GARP-Face","privacy protection","data utility preservation","face deidentification","multimedia data processing","face detection algorithm","privacy-insensitive information","facial analysis technology","gender-age-race attribute"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"GARP-face: Balancing privacy protection and utility preservation in face de-identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996249/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838135","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GARP-face: Balancing privacy protection and utility preservation in face de-identification","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"paper178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106543S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6996254,"authors":[{"name":"Ajita Rattani","affiliation":["Michigan State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ajita","lastName":"Rattani","id":"37541422200"},{"name":"Arun Ross","affiliation":["Michigan State University, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Ross","id":"37271231600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3584-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996254","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":359},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic adaptation of fingerprint liveness detector to new spoof materials","abstract":"A fingerprint liveness detector is a pattern classifier that is used to distinguish a live finger from a fake (spoof) one in the context of an automated fingerprint recognition system. Most liveness detectors are learning-based and rely on a set of training images. Consequently, the performance of a liveness detector significantly degrades upon encountering spoofs fabricated using new materials not used during the training stage. To mitigate the security risk posed by new spoofs, it is necessary to automatically adapt the liveness detector to new spoofing materials. The aim of this work is to design a scheme for automatic adaptation of a liveness detector to novel spoof materials encountered during the operational phase. To facilitate this, a novel-material detector is used to flag input images that are deemed to be made of a new spoofing material. Such flagged images are then used to retrain the liveness detector. Experiments conducted on the LivDet 2011 database suggest (i) a 62% increase in the error rate of existing liveness detectors when tested using new spoof materials, and (ii) upto 46% improvement in liveness detection performance across spoof materials when the proposed adaptive approach is used.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996254.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996254","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996254","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Materials","Detectors","Fabrication","Training","Error analysis","Fingerprint recognition","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","pattern classification","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic adaptation","fingerprint liveness detector","pattern classifier","live finger","automated fingerprint recognition system","security risk","spoofing materials","flagged images","LivDet 2011 database","liveness detection performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996254/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic adaptation of fingerprint liveness detector to new spoof materials","accessionNumber":"14838095","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996254/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic adaptation of fingerprint liveness detector to new spoof materials","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"paper218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084885S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6996284,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research & National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Bin Yang","id":"37085571428"},{"name":"Junjie Yan","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research & National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Yan","id":"37071054400"},{"name":"Zhen Lei","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research & National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Lei","id":"37405947900"},{"name":"Stan Z.

While many subsequences have improved the work with more powerful learning algorithms, the feature representation used for face detection still can't meet the demand for effectively and efficiently handling faces with large appearance variance in the wild. To solve this bottleneck, we borrow the concept of channel features to the face detection domain, which extends the image channel to diverse types like gradient magnitude and oriented gradient histograms and therefore encodes rich information in a simple form. We adopt a novel variant called aggregate channel features, make a full exploration of feature design, and discover a multi-scale version of features with better performance. To deal with poses of faces in the wild, we propose a multi-view detection approach featuring score re-ranking and detection adjustment. Following the learning pipelines in Viola-Jones framework, the multi-view face detector using aggregate channel features shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on AFW and FDDB test-sets, while runs at 42 FPS on VGA images.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996284","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggregate channel features for multi-view face detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Aggregate channel features for multi-view face detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996284/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838106","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996284/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregate channel features for multi-view face detection","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PID3318797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070794S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6996293,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Wild","affiliation":["Computational Vision Group, University of Reading, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wild","id":"37562199200"},{"name":"Petru Radu","affiliation":["Computational Vision Group, University of Reading, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Petru","lastName":"Radu","id":"37085337816"},{"name":"Lulu Chen","affiliation":["Computational Vision Group, University of Reading, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Lulu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085337856"},{"name":"James Ferryman","affiliation":["Computational Vision Group, University of Reading, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Ferryman","id":"37563809000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3584-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996293","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Robustness","Feature extraction","Standards","Accuracy","Fingerprint recognition","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","decision support systems","fingerprint identification","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","multibiometric systems","spoofing resistant 1-median fusion eliminating outliers","multibiometrics","biometric security","spoofing attempts","standard fusion rules","single fake instance","spoofing-resistant fusion scheme","anomalous fusion input","liveness information","human surveillance operators","decision support systems","fingerprint liveness detection competition","LivDet 2013 dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996293","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996293","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","abstract":"Multibiometrics aims at improving biometric security in presence of spoofing attempts, but exposes a larger availability of points of attack.

Due to confounding factors of pose, illumination, and expression, as well as occlusion and low resolution, current face recognition systems deployed in forensic and security applications operate in a semi-automatic manner; an operator typically reviews the top results from the face recognition system to manually determine the final match. For this reason, it is important to analyze the accuracies achieved by both the matching algorithms (machines) and humans on unconstrained face recognition tasks. In this paper, we report human accuracy on unconstrained faces in still images and videos via crowd-sourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In particular, we report the first human performance on the YouTube Faces database and show that humans are superior to machines, especially when videos contain contextual cues in addition to the face image. We investigate the accuracy of humans from two different countries (United States and India) and find that humans from the United States are more accurate, possibly due to their familiarity with the faces of the public figures in the YouTube Faces database. A fusion of recognitions made by humans and a commercial-off-the-shelf face matcher improves performance over humans alone.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996296","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconstrained face recognition: Establishing baseline human performance via crowdsourcing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained face recognition: Establishing baseline human performance via crowdsourcing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996296/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838101","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996296/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained face recognition: Establishing baseline human performance via crowdsourcing","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PID3322805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066135S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6996298,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Happold","affiliation":["Neya Systems, LLC, Wexford, PA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Happold","id":"37938043100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3584-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996298","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris recognition","Measurement","Training","Vectors","Eyelids","Feature extraction","Vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feature selection","image enhancement","image matching","iris recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning method","match score prediction","iris image quality assessment","iris matching algorithms","image database","random forest regressor","feature selection","feature vector dimensionality reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996298","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996298.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to predict match scores for iris image quality assessment","abstract":"Individual image quality metrics that focus on a particular form of image degradation have the virtue of being readily decipherable but also the drawback of not relating directly to the purpose for which the image is used.

We extract a large number of image quality features forming a high dimensional feature vector and label each training image with the match score for its corresponding genuine image in the enrolled database. We then train a Random Forest regressor to predict this match score, and in the course of training apply feature selection to dramatically reduce the feature vector dimensionality. A comparison of several alternative methods of feature selection is given. Our method demonstrates that the effects of image quality degradation on match scores can be predicted from image features.

In this research, we present a memorability based frame selection algorithm that enables automatic selection of memorable frames for facial feature extraction and matching. A deep learning algorithm is then proposed that utilizes a stack of denoising autoencoders and deep Boltzmann machines to perform face recognition using the most memorable frames. The proposed algorithm, termed as MDLFace, is evaluated on two publicly available video face databases, Youtube Faces and Point and Shoot Challenge. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance at low false accept rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996299.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MDLFace: Memorability augmented deep learning for video face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Databases","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Training","YouTube"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","face recognition","feature extraction","image denoising","image matching","learning (artificial intelligence)","video signal processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MDLFace","memorability augmented deep learning","video face recognition","facial feature extraction","facial feature matching","memorability based frame selection algorithm","denoising autoencoders","deep Boltzmann machines","video face databases","Youtube Faces","Point and Shoot Challenge"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"MDLFace: Memorability augmented deep learning for video face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996299/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838099","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MDLFace: Memorability augmented deep learning for video face recognition","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PID3331321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099732S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6996301,"authors":[{"name":"Shengcai Liao","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research & National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shengcai","lastName":"Liao","id":"37287533300"},{"name":"Zhen Lei","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research & National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhen Lei","id":"37405947900"},{"name":"Dong Yi","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research & National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dong Yi","id":"37085387242"},{"name":"Stan Z.

For the benchmark of this challenge, the Labeled Faces in theWild (LFW) database has been widely used. However, the standard LFW protocol is very limited, with only 3,000 genuine and 3,000 impostor matches for classification. Today a 97% accuracy can be achieved with this benchmark, remaining a very limited room for algorithm development. However, we argue that this accuracy may be too optimistic because the underlying false accept rate may still be high (e.g. 3%). Furthermore, performance evaluation at low FARs is not statistically sound by the standard protocol due to the limited number of impostor matches. Thereby we develop a new benchmark protocol to fully exploit all the 13,233 LFW face images for large-scale unconstrained face recognition evaluation under both verification and open-set identification scenarios, with a focus at low FARs. Based on the new benchmark, we evaluate 21 face recognition approaches by combining 3 kinds of features and 7 learning algorithms. The benchmark results show that the best algorithm achieves 41.66% verification rates at FAR=0.1%, and 18.07% open-set identification rates at rank 1 and FAR=1%. Accordingly we conclude that the large-scale unconstrained face recognition problem is still largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed in developing effective feature representations and learning algorithms. We thereby release a benchmark tool to advance research in this field.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982598/6996217/06996301.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A benchmark study of large-scale unconstrained face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Benchmark testing","Face recognition","Protocols","Standards","Probes","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["labeled faces in the wild","LFW database","standard LFW protocol","algorithm development","false accept rate","performance evaluation","standard protocol","benchmark protocol","LFW face image","large-scale unconstrained face recognition evaluation","learning algorithm","feature representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"A benchmark study of large-scale unconstrained face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996301/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838125","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A benchmark study of large-scale unconstrained face recognition","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"BLUFRIJCB14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077942S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982598","isNumber":"6996217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982598","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6996217","articleId":"6996301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6996314,"authors":[{"name":"Sofian Hamid","affiliation":["Institute of High Frequency Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sofian","lastName":"Hamid","id":"37838596800"},{"name":"Hammam Shakhtour","affiliation":["Institute of High Frequency Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hammam","lastName":"Shakhtour","id":"38243771800"},{"name":"Dirk Heberling","affiliation":["Institute of High Frequency Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Heberling","id":"37300721200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3662-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996314","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":757},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Reflection","Passband","Absorption","Laminates","Boundary conditions","Insertion loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","frequency selective surfaces","radomes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective radome","transmissive response","absorptive response","planar radome","laminate absorber","frequency selective structures","FSS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency selective surfaces","radome","absorber","magnetic materials"]}],"abstract":"Design of frequency selective radome having enhanced transmissive and absorptive characteristics is presented.

Also, so-called clamped-mode, log-periodic structures which provide greater bore-sight gain by employing linear elements substantially longer than one-half wavelength have been described in the patent literature. Here we show how an omni-directional, clamped-mode log-periodic antenna can be derived from its conventional (directional) counterpart. We demonstrate that the clamped-mode antenna satisfies the rigorous definition of a log-periodic structure. The operation of the antenna is described in detail using a numerical model. The antenna has two rather diverse applications, the first being as an HF broadcast antenna and the second as an isotropic (in the E-plane) source for over-the-air wireless measurements where it serves as a broadband counterpart to the so-called center-fed, Alford, or cloverleaf loop. Finally, we show that the approach termed clamping is actually the combination of two separate procedures: clamping (discrimination against the fundamental mode) and also elision (removal of part of the structure).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996363/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14837475","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A clamped-mode, log-periodic loop antenna with an omnidirectional, E-plane pattern","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A clamped-mode, log-periodic loop antenna with an omnidirectional, E-plane pattern","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"p222mclean.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042168S","chronDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6980465","isNumber":"6996302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6980465","xplore-issue":"6996302","articleId":"6996363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6996369,"authors":[{"name":"Lamia Tchoketch-Kebir","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Rochester Institute of Technology, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Lamia","lastName":"Tchoketch-Kebir","id":"38277426800"},{"name":"Boutheina Tlili","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Rochester Institute of Technology, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Boutheina","lastName":"Tlili","id":"37540591300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3662-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996369","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"abstract":"A multiple input multiple output (MIMO) dual frequency planar monopole antenna with enhanced bandwidth is proposed for portable wireless devices.

Computational efficiency is obtained by using variable-fidelity electromagnetic simulation models, auxiliary response surface approximations, as well as initial design space reduction. The optimization process is a five-step procedure: (i) design space reduction, (ii) gathering the coarse-discretization EM-simulation data, (iii) construction of the response surface approximation

radio has great potential for radio communications that require high security, spectrum efficiency and a large data rate. However, the performance of such a system, measured in terms of mode errors, is highly dependent on the alignment between the centre of the receiver array and the transmit array boresight. In addition, other impairment phenomena, such as transmit array imperfections, receiver phase errors and thermal noise can considerably degrade the performance of the orbital angular momentum radio system. In this paper, the effects caused by receive array angular and phase errors are evaluated by means of simulations. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations are employed to obtain the bit error rate performance of multi-level modulation orbital angular momentum radio systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2014.6996473","publicationTitle":"2014 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6980465/6996302/06996473.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"640","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2014.6996473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation and detection of OAM signals for radio communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Generation and detection of OAM signals for radio communications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996473/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14837366","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation and detection of OAM signals for radio communications","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"p637cano.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039034S","chronDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6980465","isNumber":"6996302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6980465","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6996302","articleId":"6996473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6996476,"authors":[{"name":"Long Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK"],"lastName":"Long Zhang","id":"37085415757"},{"name":"Steven Gao","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085401080"},{"name":"Qi Luo","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK"],"lastName":"Qi Luo","id":"37085410192"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3662-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996476","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Impedance","PIN photodiodes","Satellite antennas","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","coplanar waveguides","loop antennas","planar antennas","strip lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization reconfigurable printed loop antenna","satellite communications","right-hand circular polarization","left-hand circular polarization","linear polarization","LHCP","RHCP","PIN diodes","dual-loop planar antenna","coplanar stripline","impedance transformer","uni-directional radiation pattern","terrestrial wireless communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reconfigurable antenna","loop antenna","circular polarization","satellite communication"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a polarization reconfigurable printed loop antenna which could alter its polarization states electronically to right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) or linear polarization (LP). By inserting four PIN diodes into the symmetric gaps of a dual-loop planar antenna, the proposed antenna can switch its polarization status by controlling the on-off state of PIN diodes electronically. Meanwhile, a coplanar stripline (CPS) has been employed as an impedance transformer for this antenna. It is shown that the antenna can achieve a 5.4% 3-dB AR bandwidth with a wider impedance bandwidth of 12.5% for both RHCP and LHCP and a 7.1% impedance bandwidth for LP. The proposed antenna has a uni-directional radiation pattern with a peak gain of 9.8 dBi under all polarization status. The presented antenna can achieve polarization reconfigurability and a high gain, while having a low profile and low cost. It is promising for applications in satellite communications and terrestrial wireless communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2014.6996476","publicationTitle":"2014 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6980465/6996302/06996476.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2014.6996476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization reconfigurable loop antenna for satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996476/","displayDocTitle":"Polarization reconfigurable loop antenna for satellite communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14837413","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996476/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization reconfigurable loop antenna for satellite communications","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"p649zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050752S","chronDate":"10-11 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6980465","isNumber":"6996302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6980465","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6996302","articleId":"6996476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6996488,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis K.

Currently, 3GPP is on the study phase of this advanced MIMO technique and is working on the 3D channel model specification.

However, the NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) includes a wide variety of resource types and stakeholders. Hence, there is still a need for the existing resource scheduling approaches, but they are no longer sufficient. In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective Resource Scheduling Algorithm (MORSA) to optimize the NFVI resources. In the development of the MORSA, we designed a plug-in architecture to satisfy various requirements related to NFVI resources and stakeholder policies. The MORSA allows the NFVI Resource Scheduler to optimize simultaneously the combination of possibly conflicting objectives with multifaceted constraints in complex real world situations. Evaluation results show that the MORSA obtains approximate solutions among conflicting objectives in a reasonable computation time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996545/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14837164","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996545/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MORSA: A multi-objective resource scheduling algorithm for NFV infrastructure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MORSA: A multi-objective resource scheduling algorithm for NFV infrastructure","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"127785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124315S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979785","isNumber":"6996102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979785","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6996102","articleId":"6996545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6996560,"authors":[{"name":"Tai Manh Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Tai Manh","lastName":"Ho","id":"37085348490"},{"name":"Tuan LeAnh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Tuan","lastName":"LeAnh","id":"38581270500"},{"name":"S.M Ahsan Kazmi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"S.M Ahsan","lastName":"Kazmi","id":"37085344544"},{"name":"Choong Seon Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Choong Seon","lastName":"Hong","id":"37287529400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-288-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996560","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","Lyapunov methods","queueing theory","radio networks","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","stochastic programming","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online flow control","actual queues","virtual stability region","Lyapunov optimization problem","Lyapunov technique","primary users","maximum collision constraints","secondary user throughput utility","spectrum allocation algorithm","opportunistic scheduling policy","cognitive radio networks","stochastic network optimization","opportunistic resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Network","Resource Allocation","Lyapunov Optimization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic resource allocation via stochastic network optimization in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2014.6996560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996102","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"The 16th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"The 16th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979785/6996102/06996560.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2014.6996560","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996560","abstract":"In this paper, we develop an opportunistic scheduling policy for allocating spectrum in cognitive radio networks.

The aim of this paper is twofold: First, we analyze the problem of total energy minimization in CRSN by choosing the best relay for each cognitive sensor node in the network. A node either sends its data packet directly to the Base Station (BS) or forwards to another node; and the latter, in turn, sends both packets to the BS. The proposed optimization problem is a multiple choice knapsack optimization problem that chooses the best path for each node targeting minimizing the total energy consumption in the network under interference constraints and with the aim of satisfying a specific Bit Error Rate (BER) for the CR system. The second aim of the paper targets increasing the lifetime in CRSN. This target is important in several applications as considering energy minimization only affects the network lifetime. Consequently, another knapsack optimization problem has been formulated and solved to choose the best scenario for each node, either by sending directly to the BS or by relaying via another node, with the aim of enhancing network lifetime under interference constraints and BER requirement for the CR system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14838156","htmlLink":"/document/6996629/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy minimization and lifetime enhancement in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks via relaying under interference constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy minimization and lifetime enhancement in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks via relaying under interference constraints","confLoc":"Naples","sourcePdf":"S301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069602S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982601","isNumber":"6996615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982601","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6996615","articleId":"6996629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AEIT","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":6996635,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Morosi","affiliation":["University of Florence - CNIT, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Morosi","id":"37275195800"},{"name":"Massimiliano Biagini","affiliation":["University of Florence - CNIT, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Biagini","id":"37073216400"},{"name":"Fabrizio Argenti","affiliation":["University of Florence - CNIT, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Argenti","id":"37266590100"},{"name":"Enrico Del Re","affiliation":["University of Florence - CNIT, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Del Re","id":"37270191000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-8872-3720-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-8-8872-3721-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996635","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":594},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Interpolation","Phase shift keying","Time-frequency analysis","Estimation","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","time-frequency analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSE analysis","pilot aided OFDM systems","channel estimation techniques","mean square error","time-frequency domain","wireless channel"]}],"abstract":"Since pilot based channel estimation techniques are commonly used in OFDM systems, the determination of the mean square error (MSE) in the time-frequency domain for these algorithms can provide an effective and general tool to be used to compare all the different approaches.

Many fine-grained object recognition approaches are proposed in recent years to detect the same species objects effectively at subordinate-level. In this paper, we present a novel fine-grained vehicle recognition by utilizing collaborative feedback scheme of detection-classification-tracking in surveillance video. We collect a labeled data set of 200 car images which contains three types of car images in addition to negative samples, and extract Haar-like features from the training samples to build global appearance model for fine-grained feature representation. Then a multi-class SVMs classifier is trained offline on the training data set to distinguish the intra-class variability of cars. The collaborative feedback scheme incorporate the tracking and feedback constraint for reduce the frequency of detection and recognition. That is, the detector localizes the motion objects in every frame except that have been observed and tracked, and the best matching object with the given initial car is identified by the classifier and be tracked in the subsequent frames until it is not present. The collaborative scheme of detecting-and-tracking can decreases the computational cost in terms of the frequency of detection and recognition at each frame. The experiment result shows that our approach can effectively locate the best matching car at the frames when the target car appears.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 5th International Conference on Digital Home","pdfPath":"/iel7/6994689/6996694/06996705.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"2014 5th International Conference on Digital Home","doi":"10.1109/ICDH.2014.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDH.2014.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-Grained Vehicle Recognition via Detection-Classification-Tracking in Surveillance Video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Detectors","Feature extraction","Surveillance","Training data","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image classification","image motion analysis","object detection","object recognition","object tracking","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-grained vehicle recognition","detection-classification-tracking scheme","surveillance video","object recognition","computer vision","collaborative feedback scheme","car images","Haar-like feature extraction","intra-class variability","motion object localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fine-Grained Vehicle Recognition via Detection-Classification-Tracking in Surveillance Video","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996705/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838654","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-Grained Vehicle Recognition via Detection-Classification-Tracking in Surveillance Video","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4284a014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090308S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6994689","isNumber":"6996694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6994689","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6996694","articleId":"6996705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6996735,"authors":[{"name":"Guoming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Guangdong University of Education, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Guoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085454609"},{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Guangdong University of Education, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37876757300"},{"name":"Dong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38251817400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4284-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4285-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996735","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","PSNR","Kernel","Chaos","Visualization","Sensors","Density measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image reconstruction","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital image compressive sensing","mean shift based measurement matrix","chaotic sequences","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mean Shift","Compressive Sensing","Chaotic Sequence"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we propose a mean shift based measurement matrix for compressive sensing and systematically investigate the possibility of constructing measurement matrix with mean shift of different chaotic sequences.

Their influence toward the optical signal will affect the communication quality seriously. In this paper we will study and simulate the optical signal impairment and crosstalk penalty caused by different kinds of filters, which include Butterworth, Bessel, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) and Fabry-Perot (F-P). Signal impairment from filter concatenation effect and crosstalk penalty from out-band and in-band are analyzed from Q-penalty, eye opening penalty (EOP) and optical spectrum. The simulation results show that signal impairment and crosstalk penalty induced by the Butterworth filter is the minimum among these four types of filters. Signal impairment caused by filter concatenation effect shows that when center frequency of all filters is aligned perfectly with the laser's frequency, 12 50-GHz Butterworth filters can be cascaded, with 1-dB EOP. This value is reduced to 9 when the center frequency is misaligned with 5 GHz. In the 50-GHz channel spacing DWDM networks, total Q-penalty induced by a pair of Butterworth filters based demultiplexer and multiplexer is lower than 0.5 dB when the filter bandwidth is in the range of 42-46 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/NOC.2014.6996824","publicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971857/6996813/06996824.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOC.2014.6996824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of signal impairment and crosstalk penalty induced by different types of optical filters in 100 Gbps PM-DQPSK based systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996824/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of signal impairment and crosstalk penalty induced by different types of optical filters in 100 Gbps PM-DQPSK based systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14836230","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996824/","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of signal impairment and crosstalk penalty induced by different types of optical filters in 100 Gbps PM-DQPSK based systems","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"p35chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05312S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971857","isNumber":"6996813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971857","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6996813","articleId":"6996824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6996826,"authors":[{"name":"Paola Parolari","affiliation":["Dip.

The solution is based on the reliance on electronic DSP for the generation of the OFDM-modulated subcarriers at the transmitter and on the FFT implementation at the remote node by means of an all-optical and passive element (for example a suitable AWG) in order to demultiplex the OFDM subcarriers. By means of simulations we demonstrate the achievable performance taking into account the constraints due to the use of realistic devices and components.

The transmitter can use this information to vary the transmission parameters such as power, modulation size, code rate etc according to the channel conditions. This is known as link adaptation. In this paper, we consider a turbo-coded free-space optical (FSO) system with M-ary pulse position modulation over log-normal turbulence channels and propose an adaptive modulation scheme under peak power constraints. Our simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements of the proposed adaptive scheme over non-adaptive counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/NOC.2014.6996841","publicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971857/6996813/06996841.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOC.2014.6996841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996813","startPage":"132","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive modulation scheme for coded free-space optical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive modulation scheme for coded free-space optical systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996841/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14836224","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996841/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive modulation scheme for coded free-space optical systems","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"p132hariq.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098322S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971857","isNumber":"6996813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971857","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6996813","articleId":"6996841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6996848,"authors":[{"name":"Silvio Mandelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvio","lastName":"Mandelli","id":"37370707500"},{"name":"Maurizio Magarini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Magarini","id":"37268262100"},{"name":"Arnaldo Spalvieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Spalvieri","id":"37268261400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3872-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996848","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Phase shift keying","Approximation methods","Mathematical model","Photonics","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","optical communication","phase noise","statistical analysis","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled continuous-time signal","filtered continuous-time signal","Wiener phase noise","symbol-spaced Wiener channel model","discrete-time simulations","symbol-rate sampling","continuous-time received signal","continuous-time Wiener phase-noise","statistical tests","distributional properties","temporal properties","phase noise","discrete-time Wiener phase noise","SSWCM","optical channel","optical transmission systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996848","doi":"10.1109/NOC.2014.6996848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOC.2014.6996848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996813","publicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971857/6996813/06996848.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the filtered and sampled continuous-time signal affected by wiener phase noise","abstract":"This paper investigates the differences between the symbol-spaced Wiener channel model (SSWCM), used in discrete-time simulations to model the effect of phase noise, and that obtained by symbol-rate sampling the continuous-time received signal affected by continuous-time Wiener phase-noise. In particular, for comparison, we consider some statistical tests to check temporal and distributional properties of the two signals. We show that the mismatch measured is very weak compared to the signal power even with strong phase noise. The main result is that when the standard deviation of the discrete-time Wiener phase noise is below a threshold of approximately 0.1 rad, the SSWCM provides a good approximation, say with a power of the error between the approximated model and the actual signal that is more than 20 dB below the signal level, of the actual symbol-spaced sampled signal. This result suggests that the SSWCM can be adopted for many real-world systems, where, according to experimental results available in the literature, a standard deviation in the order of 0.1 rad is found also when the nonlinearity of the optical channel is deeply stressed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6996848/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14836220","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the filtered and sampled continuous-time signal affected by wiener phase noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the filtered and sampled continuous-time signal affected by wiener phase noise","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"p173mandelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060377S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971857","isNumber":"6996813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971857","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6996813","articleId":"6996848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6996849,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Colombo","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Colombo","id":"38467331100"},{"name":"Stefano Morganti","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Morganti","id":"37085373527"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3872-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6996849","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Optical fibers","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical fiber networks","Optical signal processing","High-speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","telecommunication channels","transponders","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable DP-16QAM-QPSK transponders","200G carriers transmission","flexgrid super-channel arrangement","dense wavelength division multiplexing networks","DWDM networks","ITU grid","multilevel m-QAM schemes","modulation techniques","spectrum efficient modulation","spectrum allocations","network capacity","100G","modulation formats","Terabit transmission","frequency 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flexgrid","super-channel","coherent detection","DWDM"]}],"abstract":"The next generation of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) networks are likely to use Flexgrid arrangement, providing operators with additional flexibility when assigning spectrum compared to traditional DWDM networks using the 50GHz ITU grid. Flexgrid breaks the spectrum up into small (typically 12.5GHz) slots, but its key feature is that contiguous slots can be joined together to form arbitrary sized blocks of spectrum. This additional flexibility will allow faster transponders that utilize high spectral efficiency modulation techniques, like multi-level m-QAM schemes. From the use of these new spectrum efficient modulation formats and finer control over spectrum allocations, a key benefit that Flexgrid offers to the network operators is that their DWDM networks can carry more traffic with optimized spectral efficiency. High speed technology became essential for realizing greater network capacity and enabling network operators to meet the increasing bandwidth challenges from new generation superfast devices, services and applications. Coherent technologies beyond 100G are now focusing on higher level modulation formats and multiple sub-carriers/channels, using super-channels to achieve Terabit transmission.","doi":"10.1109/NOC.2014.6996849","publicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971857/6996813/06996849.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOC.2014.6996849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable DP-16QAM/QPSK transponders for the transmission of coherent 200G carriers in a flexgrid super-channel arrangement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996849/","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable DP-16QAM/QPSK transponders for the transmission of coherent 200G carriers in a flexgrid super-channel arrangement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14836210","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6996849/","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable DP-16QAM/QPSK transponders for the transmission of coherent 200G carriers in a flexgrid super-channel arrangement","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"p179colombo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038564S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971857","isNumber":"6996813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971857","xplore-issue":"6996813","articleId":"6996849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6996929,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Zareh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Zareh","id":"37070410200"},{"name":"Dimos V.

due to their simplicity, robustness, effectiveness and applicability for much kind of systems. With the rapid development of technology, implementation of PID controller has gone several steps from using analog components in hardware to using some software-based program to execute PID instructions digitally in some processor-based systems. And also, these developments have brought an alternative solution to implement PID instructions in Programmable Logic Devices (PLD). Field Programmable Logic Array (FPGA) is the most advanced members of PLDs. This paper presents the digital PID algorithm on FPGA. The controller algorithm is developed using VHDL and implemented using Altera DE0 Nano Board. As the controlled system, five axis robot arm is selected, which have five dc motor and four potentiometer to determine the positions of motors. The results show that digital PID controller and also multi-feedback control systems can be implemented successively using FPGA devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6996993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14837627","htmlLink":"/document/6996993/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple closed loop system control with digital PID controller using FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple closed loop system control with digital PID controller using FPGA","confLoc":"Metz, France","sourcePdf":"3ite215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070325S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982036","isNumber":"6996851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982036","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6996851","articleId":"6996993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6997017,"authors":[{"name":"Boyi Xu","affiliation":["College of Economics &Management, School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Boyi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37402783000"},{"name":"Lida Xu","affiliation":["College of Economics &Management, School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Lida","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675863600"},{"name":"Hongming Cai","affiliation":["College of Economics &Management, School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Hongming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37279526100"},{"name":"Lihong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Economics &Management, School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37531893600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5554-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5553-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997017","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":622},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Cloud computing","Hospitals","Biomedical monitoring","Senior citizens","Diseases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computerised monitoring","data analysis","electronic health records","geriatrics","health care","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["m-health monitoring system","elderly homes application","m-health monitoring services","medical services","personalized health data processing","mobile network","cloud computing platform","pervasive health monitoring","cloud data storage module","data analysis module","resource allocation","assignment module","monitoring data","person health condition monitoring","service composition method","public medical resources","data collection","medical resource assignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing platform","hosptial information system","m-Health monitoring system","service composition","multiple tenants"]}],"abstract":"M-Health monitoring services have attracted more and more attentions especially for senior people. Many people living in elderly homes hope their health conditions to be monitored pervasively so that they could be warned before they get serious diseases. Comparing to traditional medical services which are usually provided within hospitals, m-Health monitoring faces more challenges in personalized health data processing from both views of supporting technology and application mode. In order to achieve personalized and high quality of health monitoring enabled by the new technologies, such as mobile network and cloud computing, in this paper, a framework of m-Health monitoring system based on cloud computing platform (Could-MHMS) is firstly proposed and designed to implement pervasive health monitoring. Furthermore, the modules of the framework are discussed, which are cloud data storage module, data analysis module, and resource allocation & assignment module, respectively. In data storage module, monitoring data are stored in multiple tenant spaces. Data analysis module uses domain knowledge to assess the monitored persons' health conditions. Service composition method is designed to dynamically allocate and assign public medical resources. These three modules cooperate to implement the core functions during the process of health monitoring which are data collection, data storage, data analysis, and medical resources assignment. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our architecture in the environment of elderly homes and show the usability of our method.","doi":"10.1109/ES.2014.11","publicationTitle":"2014 Enterprise Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Enterprise Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990775/6996999/06997017.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ES.2014.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture of M-Health Monitoring System Based on Cloud Computing for Elderly Homes Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997017/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of M-Health Monitoring System Based on Cloud Computing for Elderly Homes Application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14855312","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997017/","conferenceDate":"2-3 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of M-Health Monitoring System Based on Cloud Computing for Elderly Homes Application","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"5554a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079261S","chronDate":"2-3 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990775","isNumber":"6996999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990775","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6996999","articleId":"6997017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6997027,"authors":[{"name":"Dehui Zhai","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dehui","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37085467385"},{"name":"Faping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Faping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37656514500"},{"name":"Bo Gao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085463648"},{"name":"Wenli Han","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenli","lastName":"Han","id":"37085457267"},{"name":"Tiguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085460462"},{"name":"Jiajun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiajun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085460195"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5554-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5553-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997027","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turning","Manufacturing","Simulated annealing","Machine tools","Cutting tools","Fixtures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","computer aided production planning","cutting tools","fixtures","machine tools","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony algorithm","simulated annealing algorithm","process route optimization","process route sequencing","computer aided process planning","CAPP","precedence constraint","feature process elements","hybrid algorithm","machine tools","cutting tools","fixtures","manufacturing resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["process route","feature process element","ant colony algorithm","simulated annealing algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997027","abstract":"Process route sequencing is one of the key technologies for computer aided process planning (CAPP).

The simulation results confirm that the layer structure of the reinforcing bars of the wall has a significant effect on the electromagnetic fields inside buildings.","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility, Tokyo","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility, Tokyo","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982270/6997075/06997159.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of electromagnetic fields inside a building with layered reinforcing bar struck by lightning using the FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997159/","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of electromagnetic fields inside a building with layered reinforcing bar struck by lightning using the FDTD method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14837872","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997159/","conferenceDate":"12-16 May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of electromagnetic fields inside a building with layered reinforcing bar struck by lightning using the FDTD method","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"14P1S1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077123S","chronDate":"12-16 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982270","isNumber":"6997075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982270","xplore-issue":"6997075","articleId":"6997159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineer","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6997169,"authors":[{"name":"Shivam Bhasin","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Shivam","lastName":"Bhasin","id":"37392052300"},{"name":"Paolo Maistri","affiliation":["Univ.

Attacks based on analysis of electromagnetic emissions of such devices have proven to be particularly dangerous, more than power-based analyses, as they can target even small and specific portion of the chip. The electromagnetic waves can be used effectively also as an active mean of attack, by perturbing the secure computations.

The algorithm makes use of the advantages of both embedding a watermark bit to an individual sample and embedding a bit to a group or frame of samples. Here, a frame of three positive valued samples is used to define the amount of distortion to be added but only the middle sample is distorted based on the decision. Based on the watermark bit either \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d, the middle sample of a frame is made equal to one of the neighboring samples. Thus, the watermarked audio has a very good perceptual quality. Experimental results show that our new audio watermarking algorithm is not only imperceptible, but also robust against various common signal processing attacks such as amplitude modification, re-sampling, low-pass filtering, re-quantization, MP3 compression, etc. Though proposed in time domain but the algorithm can be implemented in any transform domains with little or no modification.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.6997301","publicationTitle":"16th Int'l Conf.

In the feature extraction process, instead of processing the entire image at a time, only a pair of rows or columns of an image is considered which makes the algorithm very efficient and low-cost. Considering the cross-correlations between the pairs, a unique 1-D signature of a 2-D face image is obtained which represents the variation in the face geometry along the vertical or horizontal direction. It is shown that the resulting vertical and horizontal features provide high compactness within the class and separation between the classes. It is found that the proposed design can provide a satisfactory recognition performance for different standard databases. The results of hardware implementation in terms of resources used and processing speed have also been presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.6997372","publicationTitle":"16th Int'l Conf.

Due to continuous device scaling, NBTI effect has become more severe than before and affected device life-time. Memory devices like SRAMs are tremendously affected by NBTI as the PMOS transistor gate is connected at `0' logic for a long time. Several device-level and architecture-level solutions have been proposed to improve device life-time by interrupting NBTI degradation. Such an architectural level solution is to flip data in a particular SRAM cell after a certain time, causing periodic stress and relaxation. SRAM data flipping techniques proposed so far are not so time friendly as it is needed to access each memory cell individually and flip the data stored. It makes the process more time consuming and inconvenient for present ultra-fast system with high activity factor. In this paper, we proposed a new 7-T SRAM cell to allow flipping data of more than one memory cells at same clock pulse, hence decreasing the flipping time of entire memory array and concluded that with the new proposed cell and flipping procedure, data flipping of the entire memory array will become much faster which will ensure convenient NBTI recovery.","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.6997377","publicationTitle":"16th Int'l Conf.

However, the capacity improvement of using conventional OFDM format is severely degraded over the fiber transmission due to the presence of RSOA chirp induced RF power fading. Therefore, we proposed a pre-emphasis OFDM for RSOA modulation to enhance the system performance against both RSOA low bandwidth and high chirp parameter.

Secure, reliable and seamless communications are important for facilitating tactical operations. Selective jamming attacks pose a serious security threat to the operations of wireless tactical MANETs since selective strategies possess the potential to completely isolate a portion of the network from other nodes without giving a clear indication of a problem. Our proposed mitigation techniques use the concept of address manipulation, which differ from other techniques presented in open literature since our techniques employ de-central architecture rather than a centralized framework and our proposed techniques do not require any extra overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques enable communications in the presence of source selective jamming attacks. When the presence of a source selective jammer blocks transmissions completely, implementing a proposed flipped address mechanism increases the expected number of required transmission attempts only by one in such scenario. The probability that our second approach, random address assignment, fails to solve the correct source MAC address can be as small as 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-7</sup>\n when using accurate parameter selection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997460/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14838049","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997460/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Moving-target defense mechanisms against source-selective jamming attacks in tactical cognitive radio MANETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving-target defense mechanisms against source-selective jamming attacks in tactical cognitive radio MANETs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p14marttinen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057929S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6997462,"authors":[{"name":"Shabnam Sodagari","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Shabnam","lastName":"Sodagari","id":"38278205100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5890-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997462","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Security","Cognitive radio","Conferences","Bayes methods","Monte Carlo methods","Communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cognitive radio","probability","radio spectrum management","random processes","signal detection","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure distributed spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","malicious nodes","spectrum sensing data falsification attack","fusion center","binomial multiarmed bandit process","randomized probability matching","Bayesian methods","rewarding nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","distributed spectrum sensing","data falsification attack"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997462","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2014.6997462","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","abstract":"A solution to security of distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks is provided. Malicious nodes report the channel as busy, when they detect it to be idle, to be able to exclusively use it. However, when they detect the channel as busy, they do not have incentives to misreport and send actual result to the fusion center making it nontrivial to combat spectrum sensing data falsification attack. To neutralize the effect of misreporting sensed spectrum state, this problem is modeled as a binomial multi-armed bandit process using randomized probability matching and Bayesian methods. In each round the fusion center selects subset of most rewarding nodes to use their reports in the fusion rule, while trying to identify and single out misreporting nodes.

In this paper the security challenges and threats to the existing solutions suited for smart homes are examined in detail with the objective of fostering the development of practical solutions to secure the smart homes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14838046","htmlLink":"/document/6997467/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Securing smart home: Technologies, security challenges, and security requirements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Securing smart home: Technologies, security challenges, and security requirements","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA","sourcePdf":"p67lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091142S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6997469,"authors":[{"name":"Sukhvir Notra","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, UNSW, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Sukhvir","lastName":"Notra","id":"37085486092"},{"name":"Muhammad Siddiqi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, UNSW, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Siddiqi","id":"37085491108"},{"name":"Hassan Habibi Gharakheili","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, UNSW, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Habibi Gharakheili","id":"37085490574"},{"name":"Vijay Sivaraman","affiliation":["Networks Research Group, NICTA, Sydney, Australia","School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, UNSW, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Sivaraman","id":"37295159800"},{"name":"Roksana Boreli","affiliation":["Networks Research Group, NICTA, Sydney, Australia","School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, UNSW, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Roksana","lastName":"Boreli","id":"37272025900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5890-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997469","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2158},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997469","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Bridges","Privacy","Sensors","Authentication","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alarm systems","authorisation","data privacy","domestic appliances","home computing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security risk","privacy risk","smart household appliance","Phillips Hue light-bulb","Belkin WeMo power switch","Nest smoke-alarm"]}],"abstract":"Smart household appliances, ranging from light-bulbs and door-locks to power switches and smoke-alarms, are rapidly emerging in the marketplace, with predictions that over 2 billion devices will be installed within the next four years. However, security implementations vary widely across these devices, while privacy implications are unclear to users. In this paper we dissect the behavior of a few household devices, specifically the Phillips Hue light-bulb, the Belkin WeMo power switch, and the Nest smoke-alarm, and highlight the ease with which security and privacy can be compromised. We then propose a new solution to protect such devices by restricting access at the network-level. Our solution does not require changes from device manufacturers, reduces burden on the end-users, and allows security to be offered as an overlay service by the ISP or from a specialist provider in the cloud.","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2014.6997469","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982337/6997445/06997469.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2014.6997469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental study of security and privacy risks with emerging household appliances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An experimental study of security and privacy risks with emerging household appliances","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6997469/","accessionNumber":"14838044","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental study of security and privacy risks with emerging household appliances","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p79notra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050665S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6997470,"authors":[{"name":"Suleyman Uludag","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Michigan, Flint, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Suleyman","lastName":"Uludag","id":"37297539400"},{"name":"King-Shan Lui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"King-Shan","lastName":"Lui","id":"37275934400"},{"name":"Wenyu Ren","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Wenyu","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085496305"},{"name":"Klara Nahrstedt","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Klara","lastName":"Nahrstedt","id":"37280846400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5890-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997470","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data collection","Protocols","DH-HEMTs","Public key","Encryption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system measurement","protocols","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine-to-machine data collection protocol","smart grid","scalable M2M data collection protocol","hierarchical architecture","Raspberry Pi devices","resource-constrained measurement device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997470","abstract":"One of the most promising growth and deployment domains of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications is within the context of Smart Grid and its Advanced Metering Infrastructure.

We assume that there is only statistical channel state information of both channels at transmitter and both fading channels can be with arbitrary distributions. We derive the sufficient conditions for the existence of the positive ergodic secrecy capacity under these three orders. For more general orders we also derive capacity lower and upper bounds. To achieve it, we apply the concept of channel enhancement to the continuous fading wiretap channel and derive an upper bound. Motivated by the upper bound, we also derive the lower bound of the ergodic secrecy capacity by the layered signaling. Finally numerical results show that under Nakagami-m channels, the proposed achievable scheme outperforms Gaussian signaling in several cases. More specifically, the proposed scheme may result in positive secrecy rate while Gaussian signaling only lead to zero. Thus when we apply the proposed scheme to the wireless network, the connectivity can be significantly improved.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982337/6997445/06997476.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"126","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2014.6997476","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2014.6997476","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Upper bound","Communication system security","Security","Transmitters","Receivers","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Gaussian channels","Nakagami channels","statistical analysis","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic secrecy capacity","fast fading wiretap channels","stochastic orders","convex orders","main channels","eavesdropper's channels","statistical channel state information","transmitter","capacity lower bounds","capacity upper bounds","channel enhancement","continuous fading wiretap channel","layered signaling","Nakagami-m channels","wireless network","fading Gaussian wiretao channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997476/","displayDocTitle":"On the fading Gaussian wiretap channel with statistical channel state information at transmitter","accessionNumber":"14838066","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6997476/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the fading Gaussian wiretap channel with statistical channel state information at transmitter","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p121lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063279S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6997478,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Shen","affiliation":["North Carolina State University"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Shen","id":"37070259800"},{"name":"Peng Ning","affiliation":["North Carolina State University"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ning","id":"37269721200"},{"name":"Xiaofan He","affiliation":["North Carolina State University"],"firstName":"Xiaofan","lastName":"He","id":"38469242100"},{"name":"Huaiyu Dai","affiliation":["North Carolina State University"],"firstName":"Huaiyu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37335980600"},{"name":"Yao Liu","affiliation":["University of South Florida"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405185600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5890-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997478","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel technique - Multi-Channel Ratio (MCR) Decoding, which aims at providing an anti-jamming wireless communication capability for multi-antenna wireless devices.

In this paper, we exploit the co-op MIMO structure to design and implement a physical layer (PHY-layer) security scheme for LTE-A networks. Specifically, we consider two relay-based co-op MIMO architectures and propose novel secret key generation (SKG) schemes for those cases. Information theoretic results regarding secret key generation rate (SKGR) are presented. Results indicate that relay-based co-op MIMO schemes, traditionally used to enhance LTE-A network throughput and coverage, can also increase SKGR.

In this work, we consider the underwater distributed antenna systems (DAS) consisting of geographically distributed antenna elements (DAEs) that are connected via fibers or high-speed radio links, and address the security issue in the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission of DAEs in the presence of an eavesdropper. The information message from DAS to a legitimate user is partitioned into multiple blocks, and each block is assigned to one DAE for transmission. Exploiting the low sound speed in water, the active DAE set and the corresponding transmission schedule, including the transmission starting time and the transmission power of each active DAE, are optimized with an aim of aligning the transmission blocks at the eavesdropper while keeping the blocks well-separated at the legitimate user. A practical design tailored to the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is developed. Simulation results are presented to validate the performance of proposed schemes.","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982337/6997445/06997480.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2014.6997480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2014.6997480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal alignment for secure underwater coordinated multipoint transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Signal alignment for secure underwater coordinated multipoint transmissions","htmlLink":"/document/6997480/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14838033","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal alignment for secure underwater coordinated multipoint transmissions","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p145wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062047S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6997487,"authors":[{"name":"Kexiong Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"firstName":"Kexiong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085581099"},{"name":"Sreeraksha Kondaji Ramesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"firstName":"Sreeraksha","lastName":"Kondaji Ramesh","id":"37085582154"},{"name":"Yaling Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"firstName":"Yaling","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292964500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5890-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997487","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","TV","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Receivers","Interference","Security","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","computer network security","Global Positioning System","radio networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database-driven cognitive radio network","database-driven CRN","location spoofing attack countermeasure","white space network","TV band","small cell network","secondary user","SU","GPS localization system","GPS spoofing attack detection","IEEE 802.11 packet"]}],"abstract":"The recent FCC ruling has enforced database-driven cognitive radio networks (CRNs), which include white space networks in TV bands (TV band CRNs) and newly proposed small cell networks in 3.5 GHz (3.5 GHz CRNs). In database-driven CRNs, a secondary user (SU) queries the database for available spectrum at its location. However, this creates a critical vulnerability to GPS spoofing attacks. Under this attack, an adversary compromises SUs' GPS localization system, which results in SUs querying the database with false locations and obtaining incorrect spectrum information. In this paper, we examine the impact of GPS spoofing attacks in database-driven CRNs and propose corresponding spoofing attack detection and countermeasure solutions.

However, it is a challenge task to localize the rogue AP with both high accuracy and minimal infrastructure cost. Either expensive professional infrastructure (e.g., multiple wireless sniffers) or additional hardware (e.g., directional antenna) need to be pre-deployed for rogue AP localization with high cost. Moreover, existing methods using Received Signal Strength (RSS) result in large error as RSS is suffered from the multipath and shadowing effects in complex wireless environment. In this work, we exploit the channel state information (CSI), which is readily available from commercial Wi-Fi devices, to locate the rogue AP with high accuracy. We use only a single off-the-shelf Wi-Fi device for rogue AP localization which involves minimal infrastructure requirement. Our proposed rogue AP localization framework consists of two components: direction determination and position estimation. By characterizing time domain CSI amplitude, we develop direction determination approach to estimate the direction of the rogue AP at the Wi-Fi device. We further propose two schemes to estimate position of the rogue AP: directions determined at multiple locations grounded on triangulation, or walking towards the rogue AP with direction adjustment. Results from extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments show that our framework can achieve more practical and accurate rogue AP localization when comparing with existing RSS-based approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate rogue access point localization leveraging fine-grained channel information","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2014.6997488","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982337/6997445/06997488.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2014.6997488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Accurate rogue access point localization leveraging fine-grained channel information","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997488/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838027","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate rogue access point localization leveraging fine-grained channel information","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p211zheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059945S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6997491,"authors":[{"name":"Hossen Mustafa","affiliation":["University of South Carolina"],"firstName":"Hossen","lastName":"Mustafa","id":"38476397700"},{"name":"Wenyuan Xu","affiliation":["University of South Carolina, Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Wenyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37577495000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5890-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997491","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":742},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Internet","Wireless communication","Servers","Communication system security","Security","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","security of data","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evil twin access point attack detection","wireless hotspots","Internet","Wi-Fi interface","airports","free wireless hotspot services","authentication mechanism","Wi-Fi access points","client-side mechanism","infrastructure supports","CETAD leveraging public servers","evil twin AP attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wi-Fi Security","Wireless Hotspot","Android"]}],"abstract":"Wireless hotspots allow users to use Internet via Wi-Fi interface, and many shops, caf\u00e9s, parks, and airports provide free wireless hotspot services to attract customers. However, there is no authentication mechanism of Wi-Fi access points (APs) available in such hotspots, which makes them vulnerable to evil twin AP attacks. Such attacks are harmful because they allow to steal sensitive data from users. Today, there is no client-side mechanism that can effectively detect an evil twin AP attack without additional infrastructure supports. In this paper, we propose a mechanism CETAD leveraging public servers to detect such attacks. CETAD only requires installing an app at the client device and does not require to change the hotspot APs. CETAD explores the similarities between the legitimate APs and discrepancies between evil twin APs, and legitimate ones to detect an evil twin AP attack.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic generation control","Markov processes","Prediction algorithms","Smart grids","Mathematical model","Correlation","Intrusion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power engineering computing","power system control","security of data","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic generation control","smart grid","legacy energy infrastructures","data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system","AGC","short-term adaptive predictor","area control error","ACE","Markov models"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982337/6997445/06997497.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-tier data-driven intrusion detection for automatic generation control in smart grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-tier data-driven intrusion detection for automatic generation control in smart grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997497/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997497/","accessionNumber":"14838059","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-tier data-driven intrusion detection for automatic generation control in smart grid","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p292ali.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083219S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6997504,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Zhang","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37710689000"},{"name":"Wenjing Lou","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Lou","id":"37085345363"},{"name":"Xuxian Jiang","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"Xuxian","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085528550"},{"name":"Y.

Cryptographic solutions based on secure computation outsourcing have been extensively studied in order to protect the security and privacy of user data. However, these solutions either suffer from forbiddingly high computation overhead or are only applicable to certain special classes of computations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of secure computation outsourcing using an entirely different approach - the idea is to have a secure execution environment in the cloud such that user data can be processed in plain text format without compromising its confidentiality. We propose a TrUsted Data-intensive ExeCution (TUDEC) environment optimized for data applications in the cloud. TUDEC is a new system architecture, designed to provide a secure environment for arbitrary data computations in the cloud server. Using a very small trusted computing base including only firmware and hardware, TUDEC is able to provide user VM with isolation against both the legacy host and neighboring VMs. Such isolation is unique in that it provides protection against any software-based attacks. By direct interrupt delivery, interrupt rerouting and IOMMU configuration lock, TUDEC enables close to bare metal computation and I/O performance without sacrificing any security guaranteed. We built a prototype and showed the high efficiency of TUDEC. In particular, when the server is heavily loaded, the TCP bandwidth of the guest VM in TUDEC is significantly better than the current state of art secure execution environment design.","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982337/6997445/06997504.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2014.6997504","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2014.6997504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Trusted Data-intensive execution in cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Trusted Data-intensive execution in cloud computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997504/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6997504/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14837993","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Trusted Data-intensive execution in cloud computing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p355zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091842S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982337","isNumber":"6997445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982337","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6997445","articleId":"6997504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6997524,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Tang","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Commun., University of Elec.

As an example, we applied our techniques over A Day in Internet Life DNS traces for showing how easily a mail bonnet attack can be discovered.

The availability and validity of this algorithm are verified by experiments on the typical function optimization problem as well as on the Job Shop scheduling problem.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2014.6997667","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Information Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979784/6997624/06997667.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Information Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2014.6997667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new collaborator selection method of cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm and its application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Optimization","Convergence","Job shop scheduling","Collaboration","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborator selection method","cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm","C-CGA","multiobjective problem","time complexity","distance-based collaborators selection algorithm","DBCCGA","machine learning classification","candidate individual","reference individual","function optimization problem","job shop scheduling problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A new collaborator selection method of cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm and its application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997667/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14836944","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new collaborator selection method of cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm and its application","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"mfi20140submission178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058485S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979784","isNumber":"6997624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979784","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6997624","articleId":"6997667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6997668,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Bo","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Bo","id":"37085447843"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6732-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6731-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997668","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bioinformatics","DNA","Market research","Genomics","Proteins","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","data visualisation","DNA","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-walk approach","biological sequences","self-adaptive spectral rotation method","SASR method","3-bp periodicity visualization","DNA sequences","random walk","query sequence","TP-intensive regions","bioinformatics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bioinformatics","probability","time series","protein-coding region prediction"]}],"abstract":"Presently, substantial studies have been conducted to investigate periodicities hidden in biological sequences. Among them, the Self-Adaptive Spectral Rotation (SASR) method is said to be an efficient tool to visualize the 3-bp periodicity (TP) in DNA sequences. It outputs a random walk, i.e., TP walk, in the complex plane for any query sequence. And the TP-intensive regions in the sequence can be visually discriminated from the non-TP ones in the walk. In this paper, the behaviors of the walks for non-TP sequences are further investigated qualitatively. A slightly leftward trend (an abnormity) in such walks is observed, which is not reported in the previous SASR literatures. An improved SASR, named the mature SASR, is proposed, in order to eliminate the abnormity, correct the TP walks, and provide a better visualization.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2014.6997668","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Information Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Information Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979784/6997624/06997668.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2014.6997668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved random-walk approach for visualizing periodicities hidden in biological sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997668/","displayDocTitle":"An improved random-walk approach for visualizing periodicities hidden in biological sequences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14836978","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997668/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved random-walk approach for visualizing periodicities hidden in biological sequences","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"mfi20140submission181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08683S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979784","isNumber":"6997624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979784","xplore-issue":"6997624","articleId":"6997668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6997669,"authors":[{"name":"Fengming Xin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Fengming","lastName":"Xin","id":"37530618800"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jinkuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085418749"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["Engineering Optimization and Smart Antenna Institute, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085422869"},{"name":"Xin Song","affiliation":["Engineering Optimization and Smart Antenna Institute, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Song","id":"37085401279"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6732-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6731-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997669","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Mutual information","Estimation","Noise","Covariance matrices","Mathematical model","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","information theory","radar","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform design","cognitive radar","information theory","optimal waveform design","impulse response estimation","impulse response prediction","stationary-uncorrelated scattering target impulse response model","target impulse response prediction","Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radar","Waveform design","TIR prediction"]}],"abstract":"Optimal waveform design is an important component of cognitive radar, it can transmit the designed waveform to adapt environment.

Word2vec is a tool, which establishes the neural network models to learn the vector representations of words in the high dimensional vector space. So it can extract the deep semantic relationships between words. In this paper, firstly, we cluster the similar features together using word2vec. And then we use word2vec again to learn the word representations as candidate feature vectors.

Distributed active switches are utilized in first three bits. On-chip inductances are used to provide 22.5\u00b0 phase shift steps. The placement and the geometry of these inductances are optimized for minimum phase error and insertion loss. In order to compensate the gain variations of this stage, a single stage variable gain amplifier is used. The fourth bit which provides 0/180\u00b0 phase shift is obtained in third amplification stage, with switching between common base-common emitter configuration. With utilization of this technique overall phase error is significantly decreased and overall gain is increased. The phase shifter achieves 7dB gain with 3 dB of gain error. 360\u00b0 phase shift is achieved in 4 bit resolution with a phase error of 0.5\u00b0 at center frequency of 10GHz, and maximum 22\u00b0 phase error in 4.5 GHz bandwidth.

If, for example class-F or inverse class-F high-efficiency modes are used, there is clearly a motivation to maintain devices in high-efficient states, over as much of the dynamic range as possible, where the operating supply voltage varies quite dramatically. In order to identify optimal matching solutions, the optimum fundamental and harmonic impedances need to be determined and understood at different drain voltages (V\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ds</inf>\n).

A design methodology is then discussed that allows optimized power amplifier performance for different average V\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ds</inf>\n, within the operational ET supply voltage range, and the impact this has on overall efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2014.6997866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2014.6997866","startPage":"357","endPage":"360","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971860/6997761/06997866.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 9th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using waveform engineering to optimize Class-F power amplifier performance in an envelope tracking architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Using waveform engineering to optimize Class-F power amplifier performance in an envelope tracking architecture","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6997866/","accessionNumber":"14847397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997866/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using waveform engineering to optimize Class-F power amplifier performance in an envelope tracking architecture","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043276S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971860","isNumber":"6997761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971860","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6997761","articleId":"6997866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association - EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6997883,"authors":[{"name":"Ping-Han Ho","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Han","lastName":"Ho","id":"37085434643"},{"name":"Yu-Hsuan Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37068279700"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092300"},{"name":"Chafik Meliani","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chafik","lastName":"Meliani","id":"37285044700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7036-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6997883","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997883","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Broadband amplifiers","Silicon germanium","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Fingers","Current measurement","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current mirrors","Ge-Si alloys","heterojunction bipolar transistors","millimetre wave amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SiGe HBT process","Si-based MMIC amplifiers","gain-bandwidth product","current mirrors","base current control","broadband amplifier","frequency 75 GHz to 140 GHz","gain 11 dB","frequency 231 GHz","size 0.13 mum","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Silicon-germanium (SiGe)","heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT)","D-band"]}],"abstract":"A broadband amplifier from 75 to 140 GHz in SiGe 0.13-\u03bcm process is designed, fabricated, and measured.

The proposed detector complexity is linear in the signal modulation constellation size and the number of spatial streams. Two variants of the SISO detector are developed, referred to as SISO block decision-feedback Chase detector (B-Chase) and SISO linear Chase detector (L-Chase). An efficient method is presented that uses the decoder output to modulate the signal constellation decision boundaries inside the detector leading to the SISO detector architecture. The performance of these detectors significantly improves with just a few number of IDD iterations. The effect of transmit and receive antenna correlation is simulated. For the high-correlation case, the superiority of SISO B-Chase over the SISO L-Chase is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997989/","volume":"22","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6997989/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"14862379","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Soft-Input Soft-Output MIMO Chase Detectors for Arbitrary Number of Streams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Soft-Input Soft-Output MIMO Chase Detectors for Arbitrary Number of Streams","sourcePdf":"lsp-gomaa-2385776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061663S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6994324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6994324","articleId":"6997989","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6997995,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Ruei Jhan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ruei","lastName":"Jhan","id":"38469494200"},{"name":"Yung-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293509800"},{"name":"Yu-Long Wang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Long","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085364428"},{"name":"Yao-Jen Lee","affiliation":["National Nano Device Laboratories, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Jen","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407189400"},{"name":"Min-Feng Hung","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Feng","lastName":"Hung","id":"37400131200"},{"name":"Hsin-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085366947"},{"name":"Yu-Hsiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085366037"},{"name":"Mu-Shih Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mu-Shih","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37070847200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6997995","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":787},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997995","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Annealing","Logic gates","Tunneling","Silicon","Microwave FETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect transistors","rapid thermal annealing","silicon","tunnel transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drain-induced barrier lowering","band-to-band tunneling voltage","fin-shaped polycrystalline silicon","high-temperature RTA","screening tunneling length","low-temperature MWA","dopant activation","rapid thermal annealing","tunnel field-effect transistor","low-temperature microwave annealing","temperature 490 C","temperature 1050 C","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET)","microwave annealing (MWA)","Screening tunneling length (\u03bb)","Band-to-band tunneling (BTBT)"]},{"kwd":["Tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET)","microwave annealing (MWA)","screening tunneling length ( $\\lambda $ )","band-to-band tunneling (BTBT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LED.2014.2386213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/7019014/06997995.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2014.2386213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Temperature Microwave Annealing for Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor","abstract":"Unlike the high-temperature activation of dopants, such as rapid thermal annealing (RTA), the activation of dopants by low-temperature microwave annealing (MWA) suppresses their diffusion, reducing screening tunneling length (\u03bb).

Multiple access and lowest processing speeds at the ONU are enabled by choosing 10 DFT-spread OFDM subbands. We demonstrate this FDMA network architecture in a proof-of-principle experiment with up to eight 300-MBd 16QAM subbands offering a bidirectional data rate of 9.6 Gb/s. Real-time signal processing is realized for downstream transmission. Finally, we shortly address future improvements of this network architecture by employing integrated silicon photonics and analog signal processing to enable fine FDM for next-generation access networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Dense, Single-Wavelength DFT-Spread OFDMA PON With Laserless 1.2 Gb/s ONU Ready for Silicon Photonics Integration","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2386215","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7054625/06997998.pdf","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2386215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7054625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6997998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6997998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15, 15 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Dense, Single-Wavelength DFT-Spread OFDMA PON With Laserless 1.2 Gb/s ONU Ready for Silicon Photonics Integration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6997998/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","publicationDate":"15 April15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14982543","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U-FP7 Projects OTONES and FOX-C"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"280145"},{"fundingName":"Karlsruhe School of Optics & Photonics"},{"fundingName":"Helmholtz International Research School for Teratronics"},{"fundingName":"Karlsruhe Nano-Micro Facility"},{"fundingName":"Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Micram, Xilinx (Xilinx University Program)"},{"fundingName":"Deutsche Telekom, and Telefonica I + D"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Dense, Single-Wavelength DFT-Spread OFDMA PON With Laserless 1.2 Gb/s ONU Ready for Silicon Photonics Integration","sourcePdf":"jlt-schindler-2386215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185918S","chronDate":"April15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7054625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7054625","articleId":"6997998","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998001,"authors":[{"name":"An Chen","affiliation":["GLOBALFOUNDIRES, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Chen","id":"37674292600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6998001","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2358},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998001","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","High definition video","Reliability","Security","Temperature measurement","Electrical resistance measurement","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive random access memory variability","reconfigurable physical unclonable functions","stochastic switching mechanism","intrinsic variability","reconfigurable PUF","hardware security","RRAM resistance variability","manufacturing variation","PUF design","measured RRAM properties","device model","PUF reliability","retention characteristics","voltage dependence","inter-chip Hamming distance","intra-chip Hamming distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PUF","RRAM","variability","security"]},{"kwd":["PUF","RRAM","security","variability"]}],"abstract":"The stochastic switching mechanism and intrinsic variability of resistive random access memory (RRAM) present severe challenges for memory applications, which, however, may be utilized to implement the physical unclonable function (PUF) for hardware security. A PUF based on RRAM resistance variability is proposed in this letter. Unlike PUFs based on manufacturing variation, this proposal exploits an intrinsic variability in physical mechanisms with reconfigurability. Key characteristics of the PUF design are assessed by simulation using measured RRAM properties and device model. Truly random variation of RRAM resistance is critical for PUF uniqueness (or unclonability). The reliability (or robustness) of the proposed PUF is affected by temperature and voltage dependence of RRAM resistance as well as retention characteristics. Large separation between inter-chip and intra-chip Hamming distance as the measure of uniqueness and reliability confirms the feasibility of the PUF proposal.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2014.2385870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2014.2385870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/7019014/06998001.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilizing the Variability of Resistive Random Access Memory to Implement Reconfigurable Physical Unclonable Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Utilizing the Variability of Resistive Random Access Memory to Implement Reconfigurable Physical Unclonable Functions","volume":"36","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14866755","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998001/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilizing the Variability of Resistive Random Access Memory to Implement Reconfigurable Physical Unclonable Functions","sourcePdf":"led-chen-2385870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040673S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7019014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"7019014","articleId":"6998001","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6998005,"authors":[{"name":"Na Li","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Networking Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Li","id":"37085458130"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Tao","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Networking Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37288199300"},{"name":"Jin Xu","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Networking Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37963065500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6998005","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":747},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of secure communication in the multiuser downlink with an external eavesdropper. The transmitter simultaneously transmits concurrent information signals to the users and an artificial noise (AN) to the eavesdropper. We derive a closed-form expression for the secrecy sum-rate in the large system limit and use it as the objective function to optimize the power allocation between the information signals and the AN to maximize the secrecy sum-rate. We obtain a simple approximation for the optimal power allocation in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, which proves to be a generic and near-optimal strategy. Analytical and simulation results show that more power needs to be allocated to AN if the system serves fewer users and the eavesdropper has more antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06998005.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Noise Assisted Communication in the Multiuser Downlink: Optimal Power Allocation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Optimized production technology","Resource management","Simulation","Antennas","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","multiuser channels","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial noise assisted communication","multiuser downlink","optimal power allocation","secure communication problem","external eavesdropper","transmitter","concurrent information signals","AN","closed-form expression","secrecy sum-rate","objective function","high signal-to-noise ratio regime","near-optimal strategy","generic-optimal strategy","antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","artificial noise","power allocation","regularized channel inversion","large system analysis"]},{"kwd":["Physical layer security","artificial noise","power allocation","regularized channel inversion","large system analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Noise Assisted Communication in the Multiuser Downlink: Optimal Power Allocation","volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6998005/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914545","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61325006"},{"fundingName":"National High-tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Noise Assisted Communication in the Multiuser Downlink: Optimal Power Allocation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-tao-2385779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07818S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6998005","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998006,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Guang Chen","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7061937/6998006/chen-2385759-small.gif","p":["Yu-Guang Chen (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in computer science from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","In 2014, he was a Visiting Scholar at Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, for two months.

However, it may suffer from many reliability issues such as undercut, misalignment, or random open defects. Various fault-tolerance mechanisms have been proposed in literature to improve yield, at the cost of significant area overhead. In this paper, we focus on the structure that uses one spare TSV for a group of original TSVs, and study the optimal assignment of spare TSVs under yield and timing constraints to minimize the total area overhead. We show that such problem can be modeled as a constrained graph decomposition problem. Two efficient heuristics are further developed to address this problem. Experimental results show that under the same yield and timing constraints, our heuristic can reduce the area overhead induced by the fault-tolerance mechanisms by up to 61%, compared with a seemingly more intuitive nearest-neighbor-based heuristic.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2385759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7061937/06998006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2385759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7061937","startPage":"577","endPage":"588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Spare TSV Deployment for 3-D ICs Considering Yield and Timing Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel Spare TSV Deployment for 3-D ICs Considering Yield and Timing Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15000476","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6998006/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC 101-2221-Z-007-119-MY3 and MOST 103-2218-E-007-016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1337167 and CAREER CCF-1350680"},{"fundingName":"NOVATEK Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Spare TSV Deployment for 3-D ICs Considering Yield and Timing Constraints","sourcePdf":"tcad-chen-2385759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093204S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7061937","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7061937","articleId":"6998006","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998010,"authors":[{"name":"Weizhi Lu","affiliation":["INSA de Rennes, IETR, UMR CNRS 6164, France"],"firstName":"Weizhi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085381264"},{"name":"Weiyu Li","affiliation":["CREST-ENSAI, Bruz, France"],"firstName":"Weiyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085392820"},{"name":"Kidiyo Kpalma","affiliation":["INSA de Rennes, IETR, UMR CNRS 6164, France"],"firstName":"Kidiyo","lastName":"Kpalma","id":"37295465900"},{"name":"Joseph Ronsin","affiliation":["INSA de Rennes, IETR, UMR CNRS 6164, France"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Ronsin","id":"37295459100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6998010","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":790},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Compressed sensing","Estimation","Sensors","Sparse matrices","Materials","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing performance","random Bernoulli matrices","compression ratio","column size","row size","guaranteed signal sparsity","performance floor","theoretical estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bernoulli distribution","compressed sensing","compression ratio","high dimension","random matrix"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies the sensing performance of random Bernoulli matrices with column size n much larger than row size m.

This paper proposes a novel approach based on histogram equalization (HEQ) to compensate for an orientation mismatch in robust Wi-Fi localization. The proposed method involves converting the temporal-spatial radio signal strength into a reference function (i.e., equalizing the histogram). By using equalized signals, the proposed algorithm improves the robustness of location estimation, even in the presence of mismatch orientation. The advantages of the proposed algorithm over traditional methods are that the assumption of user behavior is not required, and a digital compass does not need to be embedded on a mobile device. Experiments conducted in Wi-Fi networks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the orientation classifier method and provides comparable positioning accuracy to the compass-assisted approach.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2385814","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06998025.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2385814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"5210","endPage":"5220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensating for Orientation Mismatch in Robust Wi-Fi Localization Using Histogram Equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Compensating for Orientation Mismatch in Robust Wi-Fi Localization Using Histogram Equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998025/","volume":"64","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6998025/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587056","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC101-2221-E-155-003 and NSC102-2221-E-155-006-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensating for Orientation Mismatch in Robust Wi-Fi Localization Using Histogram Equalization","sourcePdf":"tvt-fang-2385814-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123181S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6998025","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6998031,"authors":[{"name":"Junhao Ji","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Automation, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6998031/ji-2385666-small.gif","p":["\nJunhao Ji was born in Henan, China, in 1990.

Compared with the LCL-filter, the total inductance of the LLCL-filter can be reduced a lot. However, due to the resonant inductor in series with the bypass capacitor, the differential mode (DM) electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise attenuation of an LLCL-filter-based grid-tied inverter declines. Conventionally, a capacitor was inserted in parallel with the LC resonant circuit branch of the LLCL-filter to suppress the DM EMI noise. In order to achieve a small value of capacitor as well as to minimize the additional reactive power, a novel simple DM EMI suppressor for the LLCL-filter-based system is proposed. The characters of two kinds of DM EMI suppressor are analyzed and compared in detail.

Due to the limitation of its operation principle, this method was only suitable for a single parameter monitoring. For most applications, it is desirable for multi-parameters to be monitored. In order to keep the chip area of the sensor as small as possible, multi-level inductors may be coaxially stacked. However, the transmitting signals affect each other due to strong mutual coupling between the stacked inductors. This paper presents a novel inductor structure by using a specific winding to achieve the minimized mutual inductance. Using the partial inductance theory, the mutual inductance of two stacked inductors is analyzed. Simulations of the two stacked inductors coaxially aligned, with each connected in a variable capacitor, show that the mutual inductance between the two inductors can be greatly suppressed. This phenomenon has also been verified through multi-layer PCB inductors. And capacitive temperature and pressure sensors were linked to the two stacked inductor to implement the simultaneous measurements of temperature and pressure. The measurement results indicate that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor is about 41.67 kHz/\u00b0C between -20\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C while the sensitivity of the pressure sensor is about -133.33 kHz/kPa between 50kPa to 110 kPa.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2014.2385798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things

hopping (FFH) is a powerful antijamming method. Nevertheless, channel estimation in FFH is a difficult issue and even once was deemed impractical. FFH over fading channels usually adopts noncoherent schemes that suffer from combination loss and low spectral efficiency. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a subset-based coherent FFH (S-CFFH) scheme. The proposed scheme partitions the hopping frequency set into a number of subsets. By controlling the size of hopping frequency subset, we ensure that each hopped frequency recurs within the channel coherence time, which thus enables efficient channel estimation and coherent schemes. We analyze the bit error ratio (BER) of S-CFFH/quaternary phase-shift keying in the presence of partial band noise jamming, highly frequency-selective Rayleigh fading, and channel estimation errors. We further study how to optimize the S-CFFH parameters. Closed-form expressions are provided for the BER and optimum pilot parameter. Simulation results are presented to corroborate our theoretical analysis. It is shown that S-CFFH significantly outperforms conventional noncoherent FFH in both BER and spectral efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Subset-Based Coherent FFH System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385852","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06998040.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Subset-Based Coherent FFH System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6998040/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914531","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"GF Research Program of China","grantNumber":"4010103020201-2"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0058"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201126 and 61101216"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"111-2-05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Subset-Based Coherent FFH System","sourcePdf":"lcomm-he-2385852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056584S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6998040","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998041,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongbin Rao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7017617/6998041/6998041-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiongbin Rao (S'13\u2013M'14) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and information engineering (EI) from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2010.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Department of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

To improve the scalability of C-RAN networks, it is very important to take the fronthaul loading into consideration in the signal detection, and it is very desirable to reduce the fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems. In this paper, we consider uplink C-RAN systems and we propose a distributed fronthaul compression scheme at the distributed RRHs and a joint recovery algorithm at the BBUs by deploying the techniques of distributed compressive sensing (CS). Different from conventional distributed CS, the CS problem in C-RAN system needs to incorporate the underlying effect of multi-access fading for the end-to-end recovery of the transmitted signals from the users. We analyze the performance of the proposed end-to-end signal recovery algorithm and we show that the aggregate measurement matrix in C-RAN systems, which contains both the distributed fronthaul compression and multiaccess fading, can still satisfy the restricted isometry property with high probability. Based on these results, we derive tradeoff results between the uplink capacity and the fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2386290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7017617/06998041.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2386290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7017617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Fronthaul Compression and Joint Signal Recovery in Cloud-RAN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Fronthaul Compression and Joint Signal Recovery in Cloud-RAN","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14881053","htmlLink":"/document/6998041/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Fronthaul Compression and Joint Signal Recovery in Cloud-RAN","sourcePdf":"tsp-rao-2386290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100071S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7017617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7017617","articleId":"6998041","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6998048,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Jin Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7022009/6998048/6998048-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang-Jin Jeong received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from In-Ha University, Incheon, Korea, in 2007 and the M.S. degree in information and communication engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2009.

Different from conventional EE maximization schemes that require iterative numerical methods, we derive the optimal solution as a closed form by solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The obtained closed-form expression is applicable to DAS with an arbitrary number of distributed antenna (DA) ports and general per-DA port power constraints and is also guaranteed to be globally optimum. Then, we provide several interesting observations on the proposed EE maximizing power allocation scheme. Based on these results, we propose a simplified practical power allocation method that employs the DA port selection and computes the power level in a distributed manner. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed optimal power allocation method produces the EE identical to exhaustive search with significantly reduced computational complexity. In addition, it is shown that the proposed simplified power allocation method based on the DA port selection exhibits little performance loss compared to the optimal algorithm with a remarkable reduction in the system overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06998051.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation Scheme for Energy Efficiency Maximization in Distributed Antenna Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998051/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation Scheme for Energy Efficiency Maximization in Distributed Antenna Systems","volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14930610","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998051/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2010-0017909 and 2014R1A2A1A10049769"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A1A1060503"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation Scheme for Energy Efficiency Maximization in Distributed Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-kim-2385772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106994S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6998051","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998053,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangfan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7027925/6998053/6998053-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiangfan Zhang (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008, and the M.Eng. degree in information and communication engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 2011.","Since 2011, he has been working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA.

Several subsets of sensors are assumed to be tampered with by adversaries using different attacks such that the compromised sensors transmit fictitious data. First, we consider the task of identifying and categorizing the attacked sensors into different groups according to distinct types of attacks. It is shown that increasing the number K of time samples at each sensor and enlarging the size N of the sensor network can both ameliorate the identification and categorization, but to different extents. As K\u2192\u221e, the attacked sensors can be perfectly identified and categorized, while with finite but sufficiently large K, as N\u2192\u221e, it can be shown that the fusion center can also ascertain the number of attacks and obtain an approximate categorization with a sufficiently small percentage of sensors that are misclassified. Next, in order to improve the estimation performance by utilizing the attacked observations, we consider joint estimation of the statistical description of the attacks and the parameter to be estimated after the sensors have been well categorized. When using the same quantization approach successfully employed without attacks, it can be shown that the corresponding Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is singular. To overcome this, a time-variant quantization approach is proposed, which will provide a nonsingular FIM, provided that K \u2265 2. Furthermore, the FIM is employed to provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which utilizing the compromised sensors in the proposed fashion will lead to better estimation performance when compared to approaches where the compromised sensors are ignored.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2386281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7027925/06998053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2386281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027925","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically Optimum Distributed Estimation in the Presence of Attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically Optimum Distributed Estimation in the Presence of Attacks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2015","accessionNumber":"14914717","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6998053/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-14-1-0245 and W911NF-14-1-0261"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically Optimum Distributed Estimation in the Presence of Attacks","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2386281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093155S","chronDate":"March1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7027925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7027925","articleId":"6998053","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998056,"authors":[{"name":"Anish Turlapaty","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Aviation Sciences, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7017617/6998056/6998056-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anish Turlapaty (S'08) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Nagarjuna University, India, in 2002, the M.Sc.degree in engineering degree in radio astronomy and space sciences from the Chalmers University, Sweden, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, in 2010.","From July 2010 to January 2012, he was at Mississippi State as a postdoctoral associate working on pattern recognition and digital signal processing based methods for detection of subsurface radioactive waste using electromagnetic induction spectroscopy.

The target is modeled as a complex Gaussian random process. Using iterative waveform transmission, the cognitive radar estimates the target's characteristic parameters and updates its probabilistic model based on new measurements. The adaptive waveform is designed by minimizing the conditional entropy from the posterior density of the model parameters. We analyze the performance of the developed Bayesian sequential estimation algorithm and derive expressions for the signal-to-noise ratio gain, the asymptotical posterior Cramer Rao bound, and the mutual information gain. The analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the adaptive sequential Bayesian estimator yields accelerated convergence of the estimate towards its true value and a smaller estimation error compared with the conventional Bayesian estimator that uses fixed waveform transmission under Gaussian or non-Gaussian noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14866838","htmlLink":"/document/6998056/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Sequential Parameter Estimation by Cognitive Radar With Multiantenna Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Sequential Parameter Estimation by Cognitive Radar With Multiantenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tsp-jin-2386292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123568S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7017617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7017617","articleId":"6998056","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6998058,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Jamali","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7041264/6998058/jamal-2385858_print-small.gif","p":["\nVahid Jamali (S'12) was born in Fasa, Iran, in 1988.

In this paper, we consider LDPC codes for the binary erasure channel (BEC), use code rate for performance metric, and number of decoding iterations to achieve a certain residual erasure probability for complexity metric. We first propose a quite accurate approximation of the number of iterations for the BEC. Moreover, a simple but efficient utility function corresponding to the number of iterations is developed. Using the aforementioned approximation and the utility function, two optimization problems w.r.t. complexity are formulated to find the code degree distributions. We show that both optimization problems are convex. In particular, the problem with the proposed approximation belongs to the class of semi-infinite problems which are computationally challenging to be solved. However, the problem with the proposed utility function falls into the class of semi-definite programming (SDP) and thus, the global solution can be found efficiently using available SDP solvers. Numerical results reveal the superiority of the proposed code design compared to existing code designs from literature.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06998058.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Fast Convergent LDPC Codes for the BEC: An Optimization Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Fast Convergent LDPC Codes for the BEC: An Optimization Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998058/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14930608","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998058/","volume":"63","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Fast Convergent LDPC Codes for the BEC: An Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tcomm-jamali-2385858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112925S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6998058","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6998059,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangming Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7047256/6998059/6998059-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhangming Zhu received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in microelectronics from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2000, 2003, and 2004, respectively.

In this paper, an EC-ADC for large scale sensor arrays is proposed. At the system level, a double-sampling configuration for incremental \u03a3\u0394 modulators is proposed. By applying this configuration, the clock frequency of EC-ADC can be almost halved for the same conversion accuracy and rate. At the circuit level, the contribution of class-AB operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) structure to the low power design is analyzed and a class-AB OTA applicable for EC-ADC is developed. The proposed architecture has been implemented using a commercial 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology. Measured results show that a power consumption of less than 77 \u03bcW can be achieved at the conversion rate of 51.2 Ksamples/s and 12.2-bit accuracy respectively.

Specifically, low-density parity-check codes are adopted for use over the channel, their benefits are studied, and suitable codes are designed. Iterative joint decoding is used at the receivers, where independent and identically distributed channel adapters are used to prove that log-likelihood-ratios exchanged among the nodes of the Tanner graph enjoy symmetry when BPSK or QPSK with Gray coding is employed. This property is exploited in the proposed code optimization algorithm adopting a random perturbation technique. Code optimization and convergence threshold computations are carried out for different GICs employing finite constellations by tracking the average mutual information. Furthermore, stability conditions for the admissible degree distributions under strong and weak interference levels are determined. Via examples, it is observed that the optimized codes using BPSK or QPSK with Gray coding operate close to the capacity boundary for strong interference. For the case of weak interference, it is shown that nontrivial rate pairs are achievable via the newly designed codes, which are not possible by single user codes with time sharing. Performance of the designed codes is also studied for finite block lengths through simulations of specific codes picked with the optimized degree distributions with random constructions, where, for one instance, the results are compared with those of some structured designs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06998073.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2385856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing the Han\u2013Kobayashi Scheme Using Low Density Parity Check Codes Over Gaussian Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998073","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7041264/6998073-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Implementing the Han\u2013Kobayashi Scheme Using Low Density Parity Check Codes Over Gaussian Interference Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998073/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14930609","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998073/","volume":"63","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"4-1293-5-213"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF-CCF 1117174"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"MC-CIG PCIG12-GA-2012-334213"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Implementing the Han\u2013Kobayashi Scheme Using Low Density Parity Check Codes Over Gaussian Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-duman-2385856-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154479S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6998073","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6998075,"authors":[{"name":"Yuejie Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7017617/6998075/6998075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuejie Chi (S'09\u2013M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2012, and the B.E.

By deploying tilt-adjustable antenna arrays at the base stations (BSs), cell coverage optimization can become a promising technique that is able to strike a compromise between covering cell-edge users and pilot contamination suppression. We formulate a detailed description of this optimization problem by maximizing the cell throughput, which is shown to be mainly determined by the user distribution within several key geometrical regions. Then, the formulated problem is applied to different example scenarios. For a network with hexagonal cells and uniformly distributed users, we derive an analytical lower bound of the ergodic throughput in the objective cell; based on this, it is shown that the optimal choice for the cell coverage should ensure that the coverage of different cells does not overlap. For a more generic network with sector-shaped cells and nonuniformly distributed users, we propose an analytical approximation of the ergodic throughput. After that, a practical coverage optimization algorithm is proposed, where the optimal solution can be easily obtained through a simple 1-D line searching within a confined searching region. Our numerical results show that the proposed coverage optimization method is able to greatly increase the system throughput in macrocells for the massive MIMO uplink transmission, compared with the traditional schemes where the cell coverage is fixed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7355269/06998088.pdf","startPage":"5713","endPage":"5727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2385878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2385878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell Coverage Optimization for the Multicell Massive MIMO Uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Uplink","Optimization","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","MIMO communication","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simple 1D line searching algorithm","cell ergodic throughput maximization","pilot contamination suppression","cell-edge user distribution","base station","tilt-adjustable antenna array deployment","massive multiple-input multiple-output uplink","multicell massive MIMO uplink transmission","cell coverage optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell coverage","massive MIMO","pilot contamination","uplink"]},{"kwd":["Cell coverage","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","pilot contamination","uplink"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cell Coverage Optimization for the Multicell Massive MIMO Uplink","volume":"64","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6998088/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661977","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401240, 61222102 and 61320106003"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012021"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001032-004"},{"fundingName":"Program for Jiangsu Innovation Team"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFT10300"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell Coverage Optimization for the Multicell Massive MIMO Uplink","sourcePdf":"tvt-jin-2385878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105095S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7355269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7355269","articleId":"6998088","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998089,"authors":[{"name":"Gemine Vivone","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Science and Technology Organization (STO) Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7001732/6998089/vivon-2361734-small.gif","p":["\n\nGemine Vivone received the B.Sc.

In the last decades, many algorithms addressing this task have been presented in the literature. However, the lack of universally recognized evaluation criteria, available image data sets for benchmarking, and standardized implementations of the algorithms makes a thorough evaluation and comparison of the different pansharpening techniques difficult to achieve. In this paper, the authors attempt to fill this gap by providing a critical description and extensive comparisons of some of the main state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. In greater details, several pansharpening algorithms belonging to the component substitution or multiresolution analysis families are considered. Such techniques are evaluated through the two main protocols for the assessment of pansharpening results, i.e., based on the full- and reduced-resolution validations. Five data sets acquired by different satellites allow for a detailed comparison of the algorithms, characterization of their performances with respect to the different instruments, and consistency of the two validation procedures. In addition, the implementation of all the pansharpening techniques considered in this paper and the framework used for running the simulations, comprising the two validation procedures and the main assessment indexes, are collected in a MATLAB toolbox that is made available to the community.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2361734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2361734","startPage":"2565","endPage":"2586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7001732/06998089.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Critical Comparison Among Pansharpening Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Critical Comparison Among Pansharpening Algorithms","volume":"53","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14847907","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6998089/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Critical Comparison Among Pansharpening Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tgrs-vivone-2361734-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216369S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7001732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"541","xplore-issue":"7001732","articleId":"6998089","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6998093,"authors":[{"name":"Hanan Al-Tous","affiliation":["College of Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7103375/6998093/altou-2385859-small.gif","p":["\nHanan Al-Tous (M'00) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering \nand the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from The University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan, in 1998 and 2000, \nrespectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab \nEmirates, in 2014.

The first algorithm is based on sequential single-item auction, where each user submits a bid based on either the marginal increase or the relative marginal increase in the data rate using the subcarrier. The first bidding strategy maximizes the sum data rate, whereas the second bidding strategy maximizes the fairness index. In both cases, the subcarrier is assigned to the user who submits the highest bid. The algorithm proceeds in a sequential fashion until all subcarriers are assigned. To reduce the synchronized interactions between the base station and the users, we propose a one-shot auction algorithm, where each user submits bids for all subcarriers at once based on the Shapley value, a well-known cooperative-game theoretic concept. The user evaluates each subcarrier based on an estimation of the Shapley value. The subcarriers are then assigned based on the submitted bids using an iterative algorithm that maximizes the fairness index. The throughput and fairness indices are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Numerical results are used to show the merits of each algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2385859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7103375/06998093.pdf","startPage":"2377","endPage":"2393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2385859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7103375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiple-User AF-OFDMA Systems Using the Auction Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998093/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiple-User AF-OFDMA Systems Using the Auction Framework","volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15111826","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998093/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Multiple-User AF-OFDMA Systems Using the Auction Framework","sourcePdf":"twc-altous-2385859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157362S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7103375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7103375","articleId":"6998093","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998094,"authors":[{"name":"Aimin Jiang","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7001724/6998094/6998094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aimin Jiang (S'07\u2013M'11) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.

The entire PLL circuit is finally simulated using the QSS model of the loop-filter, charge-pump and VCO, in conjunction with standard high-level models of the PLL digital circuits. To verify the proposed QSS method, measured phase noise is compared with simulated phase noise. It is shown that simulated phase noise accurately predicts the measured phase noise with improved accuracy, and an increase in simulation efficiency by more than 50 times. Measured and simulated results generally demonstrate the feasibility of the QSS modeling for mixed-signal circuit simulation and design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998096/","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14964377","volume":"62","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Quantized-State System Models for a PLL Loop Filter Using Verilog-AMS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Quantized-State System Models for a PLL Loop Filter Using Verilog-AMS","sourcePdf":"tcsi-jakobsson-2377411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137245S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7047256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7047256","articleId":"6998096","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6998097,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Joong Kim","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7066864/6998097/6998097-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seong Joong Kim received the Bachelor and the Master degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Hanyang University, Korea, in 2001 and in 2003, respectively.

Using time as the processing variable, the proposed controller operates with CMOS-level digital-like signals but without adding any quantization error. A ring oscillator is used as an integrator in place of conventional opamp-RC or G m-C integrators while a delay line is used to perform voltage to time conversion and to sum time signals. A simple flip-flop generates pulse-width modulated signal from the time-based output of the controller. Hence time-based control eliminates the need for wide bandwidth error amplifier, pulse-width modulator (PWM) in analog controllers or high resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital PWM in digital controllers. As a result, it can be implemented in small area and with minimal power. Fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process, the prototype buck converter occupies an active area of 0.24 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, of which the controller occupies only 0.0375 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

With a 500 mA step in the load current, the settling time is less than 3.5 \u03bcs and the measured reference tracking bandwidth is about 1 MHz. Better than 94% peak efficiency is achieved while consuming a quiescent current of only 2 \u03bcA/MHz.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2014.2378216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7066864/06998097.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"1001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2014.2378216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7066864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Frequency Buck Converter Design Using Time-Based Control Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998097/","displayDocTitle":"High Frequency Buck Converter Design Using Time-Based Control Techniques","volume":"50","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15013817","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998097/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Frequency Buck Converter Design Using Time-Based Control Techniques","sourcePdf":"jssc-kim-2378216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088774S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7066864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7066864","articleId":"6998097","onlineDate":"24 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6998254,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiang Cheh Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Hsiang Cheh","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275101100"},{"name":"Ting Hsuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Ting Hsuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37072328500"},{"name":"Feng Cheng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Innovative Information and Technology, Tamkang University, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Feng Cheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37415447100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5390-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5389-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998254","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Propagation losses","Data compression","Multimedia communication","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data compression","image coding","image reconstruction","telecommunication channels","visual communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compressed sensing","multichannel transmission","data compression","compressed information error control","image reconstruction","lossy channel","independent channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","error control","image quality","transmission"]}],"abstract":"Compressed sensing has attracted much attention in researches due to its new thoughts and superior performances in data compression.

Among the methods for obtaining solutions to NP-hard problems, the particle swarm optimization is an efficient one. MRCPSPs include two sub-problems, namely activity operating priority and activity operating mode, two particle swarm optimization are adopted for solving these two sub-problems. A conventional PSO algorithm is applied to find activity operating priority while a discrete one is used to obtain activity operating mode. Meanwhile, a group communication mechanism based on global ratio (GR) is designed to determine dynamically whether the global topology or local topology should be used to stabilize convergence. In this study, PSO with GR design is named GRPSO. Moreover, a dual S-decreasing curve is also proposed to dynamically control the inertia weight, constriction factor and GR they are associated with the search area to ensure that the global exploration in the early stage of searches and the local exploitation in the later stage of searches are able to search the optimal solution effectively while maintain the exploration capacity at a certain level during the middle stage of searches to boost efficiency in finding the optimal solution. The results of the experiments prove the method proposed in this work can effectively find optimal solutions to MRCPSP problems.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.117","startPage":"443","endPage":"446","publicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998244","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990729/6998244/06998363.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Enhancement by Applying Global Ratio Based Communication Topology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998363/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Enhancement by Applying Global Ratio Based Communication Topology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998363/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14838375","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Enhancement by Applying Global Ratio Based Communication Topology","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"5390a443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063744S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990729","isNumber":"6998244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990729","xplore-issue":"6998244","articleId":"6998363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6998375,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Ishihara","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka-shi, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Ishihara","id":"37085504387"},{"name":"Michiharu Niimi","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka-shi, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Michiharu","lastName":"Niimi","id":"37294950600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5390-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5389-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998375","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signatures","Receivers","Data mining","Public key cryptography","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","QR codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compatible 2D-code","tamper detection system","QR-code","Quick Response codes","smart-phone","cell phone","malicious Websites","public key cryptography system","encrypted hash value","wet paper code","matrix barcodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QR code","Digital signature","Wet Paper code","Tamper detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998375","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998244","publicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990729/6998244/06998375.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compatible 2D-Code Having Tamper Detection System with QR-Code","abstract":"The matrix barcodes known as Quick Response (QR) codes, which are enable us to import printed digital information into smart-phone or cell phone through its digital camera easily, are rapidly becoming widespread not only Japan but also Asia, Europe and America. However, an attacker is easily able to lead malicious web-sites by putting a unauthenticated QR code on a authenticated QR code. We propose a compatible 2d-code having tamper detection system with QR-code. In digital signature system, a hash value of a message is calculated firstly, and then the hash value is encrypted by a secret key which is a pair of public key cryptography system. Then, a sender sends the message and the encrypted hash value to a receiver. In the receiver side, the hash value of a sent message is calculated and the hash value with encrypted is decrypted using a public key which is a pair of public key cryptography system. The receiver can detect modification of the message by comparing the two hash values. The encrypted hash value is embedded by using Wet Paper code within cells of QR-codes. In this paper, we report the robustness of reading cells of QR code which plays an important role in our code and the state of the progress for the implementation of the proposed system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6998375/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838527","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compatible 2D-Code Having Tamper Detection System with QR-Code","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compatible 2D-Code Having Tamper Detection System with QR-Code","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"5390a493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043747S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990729","isNumber":"6998244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990729","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6998244","articleId":"6998375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6998376,"authors":[{"name":"Kitahiro Kaneda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kitahiro","lastName":"Kaneda","id":"37397736500"},{"name":"Hiroyasu Kitazawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyasu","lastName":"Kitazawa","id":"37085490348"},{"name":"Keiichi Iwamura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichi","lastName":"Iwamura","id":"37395263200"},{"name":"Isao Echizen","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Isao","lastName":"Echizen","id":"37337622900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5390-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5389-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998376","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Data mining","Printers","Parity check codes","Media","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encapsulation","error correction codes","feature extraction","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-dot pattern method","information-hiding","error-correcting code","electronically readable watermark","printed materials","information extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["information hiding","digital watermarking","error correcting code","LDPC code","printed materials"]}],"abstract":"In this study, we focus on a technique that embeds an electronically readable watermark directly on printed materials.

From an investigation of the statistical model based VAD, it was discovered that the geometric mean of likelihood ratio as decision function is not desirable for the nonlinear input space and thus support vector machine (SVM) with nonlinear kernel function was proposed as the novel decision function. However, the SVM cannot be considered as strong one since it cannot fully take the nonlinear distribution of parameters, due to its shallow property. This problem can be addressed by the novel VAD framework using DBN which can fully fuse the advantages of multiple features through multiple-layer deep architecture. To achieve successful performance at statistical model-based VAD, we apply DBN as decision function. The performance of the proposed VAD algorithm is evaluated in terms of an objective measure and shows significant improvement compared to the conventional algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.150","startPage":"582","endPage":"585","publicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998244","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990729/6998244/06998396.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice Activity Detection Based on Statistical Model Employing Deep Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998396/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Voice Activity Detection Based on Statistical Model Employing Deep Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998396/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14838462","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice Activity Detection Based on Statistical Model Employing Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"5390a582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082984S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990729","isNumber":"6998244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990729","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6998244","articleId":"6998396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6998420,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Yi Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung Hua University"],"firstName":"Chun Yi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085448252"},{"name":"Chang Wu Yu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung Hua University"],"firstName":"Chang Wu","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278966000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5390-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5389-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998420","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directional antennas","Wireless networks","Mobile ad hoc networks","Educational institutions","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","mobile ad hoc networks","network theory (graphs)","probability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["specific random sector graph probability computing","directional antenna","mobile device","RSG","wireless ad hoc sensor network topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["random sector graphs","ad hoc networks","quantitative analysis"]}],"abstract":"A random sector graph \u03c8Z(Xn, r, ?, A) consists of n same size circular sectors with sector degree ?, which uniformly randomly distribute in space A.

Because the conventional handover decision is only based on the received signal strength (RSS), user equipments near the center of macro cells hardly camp on femtocells, even if the RSS of femtocells satisfies the link quality requirement. In order to increase offloading of users(UEs) from macro to pico base stations, a cell-specific virtual offset is added to the RSS to artificially expand the cell range of the femto base stations. We analyze handover decision performance with adaptive offset. When the RSS of femtocells satisfies the link quality threshold, the algorithm compensates large differences between RSS measurements of macro cells and femtocells by a priori setting a femtocell boundary, indicating that user equipments stay inside the expected coverage of femtocells. We mathematically assess the algorithm in a log-distance path loss and log-normal shadowing environment, and compare it with the conventional one under two different trajectories, moving forward and perpendicular. The numerical results show that with our adapted offset the algorithm can efficiently raise the utility of femtocells and reduce unnecessary handover numbers.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.187","publicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990729/6998244/06998432.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Handover Decision with Adaptive Offset in Next-Generation Hybrid Macro/Femto-cell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998432/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Handover Decision with Adaptive Offset in Next-Generation Hybrid Macro/Femto-cell Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838424","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998432/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Handover Decision with Adaptive Offset in Next-Generation Hybrid Macro/Femto-cell Networks","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"5390a729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078767S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990729","isNumber":"6998244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990729","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6998244","articleId":"6998432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6998440,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Shen","id":"37978803300"},{"name":"Ningwei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ningwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085402088"},{"name":"Huihuai Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huihuai","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085415553"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5390-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5389-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998440","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998440","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communities","Complex networks","Genetic algorithms","Encoding","Sociology","Statistics","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","encoding","genetic algorithms","matrix algebra","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","overlapping community detection","adjacency matrix transform","weighting edges","matrix-based encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex Networks","Genetic Algorithm","Overlapping Community Detection","Nodes Centrality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.195","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990729/6998244/06998440.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","startPage":"766","endPage":"769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Genetic Algorithm for Overlapping Community Detection","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a new genetic algorithm to detecting overlapping community in networks.

By experimental comparison with other algorithms, simulation results show that the algorithm is effective and efficient when detecting overlapping community.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998440/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14838536","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998440/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Genetic Algorithm for Overlapping Community Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Genetic Algorithm for Overlapping Community Detection","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"5390a766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055689S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990729","isNumber":"6998244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990729","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6998244","articleId":"6998440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6998444,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangjie Fu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhangjie","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085341995"},{"name":"Xinyue Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xinyue","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085363589"},{"name":"Jin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292899700"},{"name":"Xingming Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xingming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37290262300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5390-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5389-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998444","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Encryption","Access control","File systems","Secure storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data integrity","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cloud storage","data storage security","legal access","access authorization","authentication security data sharing","stored data encryption","data confidentiality","cryptographic data","tamper-proof technology","data integrity","data traceability","file systems","secure data deletion","CP-ABE","fine-grained access policy","file encryption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["secure storage of data","access control","data integrity","key manage","tracking technology"]}],"abstract":"Cloud storage brings convenient storage of data, at the same time there are also hidden security issues.

However, LTE faces signal attenuation and other problems during transmission. FBSs (Femto Base Stations) provide viable solutions to the problems in indoor and urban areas with poor channel quality. But deployment of FBSs causes interference because FBSs are typically installed by end users. In downlink communication, interference can occur between MBS (Macro Base Station) and FBS, or among FBSs. Thus, when an FBS is conducting communication with FUEs (Femtocell User Equipments) under its service in the downlink, how to reduce the interference on other FUEs in order to increase the overall throughput is an important research topic. This paper presents two methods, finding trouble nodes (FTN) and trouble node-aware power back off (TAPB), for achieving the goal. The former is used to identify those FBSs that cause significant interference (trouble nodes) so that power control has to be imposed upon them. The latter is the scheme of actual power control. Results show that the proposed approach is effective in enhancing the throughput of femtocell networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Co-tier Interference Mitigation for Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.226","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6990729/6998244/06998472.pdf","startPage":"898","endPage":"901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Co-tier Interference Mitigation for Femtocell Networks","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998472/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14838570","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Co-tier Interference Mitigation for Femtocell Networks","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"5390a898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062197S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6990729","isNumber":"6998244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6990729","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6998244","articleId":"6998472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6998491,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Sheng Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, China University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pu Sheng","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37085399133"},{"name":"Ter Feng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Ilan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ter Feng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37534600500"},{"name":"Nien Tsu Hu","affiliation":["Integrated Logistical Support Center, Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Nien Tsu","lastName":"Hu","id":"38235663100"},{"name":"Jen Yang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Ming Chuan University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37336879500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5390-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5389-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998491","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998491","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","CMOS image sensors","Collision avoidance","Microcontrollers","Wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","collision avoidance","embedded systems","microcontrollers","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wheeled mobile robots","CMOS image sensors","real-time obstacle avoidance system","channel weighting parameter method","ATMega162 embedded microcontroller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["obstacle avoidance system","Wheeled mobile robots","CMOS image sensor","channel weighting parameter method"]}],"abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to adopt CMOS image sensors to build a real-time obstacle avoidance system for wheeled mobile robots, so that the robot can continually detect surroundings, avoid obstacles, and move toward the target area.

Although wireless multimedia sensors are widely used to deliver multimedia content due to the availability of inexpensive CMOS cameras, their computational and memory resources are still typically very limited. It is known that allowing a low-cost camera sensor node with limited RAM size to perform a multi-level wavelet transform, will in turn limit the size of the acquired image. Recently, fractional wavelet filters technique became an interesting solution to reduce communication burden and wireless bandwidth, for resource-constrained devices. Classical fractional wavelet transforms can achieve much reduction in the required memory at the expense of the reconstructed image quality. In this paper, two new modified fractional wavelet transforms are proposed to reduce boundaries artifacts caused by the previous fractional wavelets. In the first proposed technique, the average of the last and the first rows and the average of the row before the last one and the second row of any two successive fractions are obtained and, respectively located at the same rows of the same fractions. In the second proposed technique, the average of the last and the first rows of any two successive fractions is obtained and then, respectively located at the same rows of the same fractions. The resulting reconstructed images of the later technique highlight the promising performance of its applications on different types of images with different sizes using Haar and bio 5/3 wavelet filters. FPGA implementations of such techniques indicate that the later one is also superior.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCPCE.2013.6998741","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Communication, Computer, Power, and Control Engineering (ICECCPCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Communication, Computer, Power, and Control Engineering (ICECCPCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982271/6998733/06998741.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCPCE.2013.6998741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of modified fractional wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998741/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of modified fractional wavelet transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14837954","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998741/","conferenceDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of modified fractional wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Mosul, Iraq","sourcePdf":"176p95100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065707S","chronDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6982271","isNumber":"6998733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6998733","articleId":"6998741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6998747,"authors":[{"name":"Mazin Rejab Khalil","affiliation":["Technical computer engineering department, Technical college of Mosul, Mosul, IRAQ"],"firstName":"Mazin Rejab","lastName":"Khalil","id":"37085530474"},{"name":"Shaima Mohammed Ali","affiliation":["Technical computer engineering department, Technical college of Mosul, Mosul, IRAQ"],"firstName":"Shaima Mohammed","lastName":"Ali","id":"37085537487"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5633-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5632-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998747","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"abstract":"Synthesis techniques of passive or active circuits require a media to display the inferred form of the realized filters and their components.

In this work, a new two semi-blind and data-aided techniques are proposed to achieve an accurate carrier frequency offset (CFO) and flat fading channel estimation in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based T-transform (T-OFDM) system. The semi-blind is utilised only two trial values to achieve joint CFO and channel estimation. Also, a new data-aided CFO estimator over the additive white Gaussian noise is proposed. The two proposed techniques are based on a low computational complexity T-transform, which was developed formally to combine the Walsh-Hadamard transform and inverse discrete Fourier transform into a single unitary transform. The unique butterfly structure of the T-transform can be exploited in the semi-blind joint CFO and channel estimator by utilizing only two trial samples from the T-OFDM symbol. This technique is able to estimate the CFO mismatch and the flat fading channel varying in every transmitted frame.

Filtering operations of IBDFE, which are used to remove intersymbol interference (ISI), are implemented by fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) that yield a much lower complexity than equivalent time domain (TD) structures. Further, the proposed structure is performed iteratively and IBDFE is designed according to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria. The feedback signal after error-correction code is directly designed from soft detection at the previous iteration. Simulations performed for downlink communication on wireless fading multipath channels show that the combination of IBDF-IC provides an efficient solution with good performance for IDMA systems in ISI channels. Further, IBDFE-IDMA outperforms existing SC-FDE and multi-carrier IDMA schemes with cyclic prefixing (CP) and zero padding (ZP) techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCPCE.2013.6998768","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Communication, Computer, Power, and Control Engineering (ICECCPCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Communication, Computer, Power, and Control Engineering (ICECCPCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982271/6998733/06998768.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCPCE.2013.6998768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative block DFE (IBDFE) and IC techniques based chip-level multiple access systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998768/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative block DFE (IBDFE) and IC techniques based chip-level multiple access systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14837984","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998768/","conferenceDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative block DFE (IBDFE) and IC techniques based chip-level multiple access systems","confLoc":"Mosul, Iraq","sourcePdf":"84p4245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055899S","chronDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6982271","isNumber":"6998733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6998733","articleId":"6998768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6998769,"authors":[{"name":"Ali A.

The research investigates the AES algorithm with regard to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and the Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL). ModelSim-Altera Starter Edition Software for Quartus II is used for simulation and optimization of the structural VHDL code. All the required transformations of the encryption and decryption processes are done using a pipelined cyclic design method to minimize hardware consumptions. The pipelined design is implemented on Altera Cyclone IV family of FPGA devices and a good throughput is achieved with minimal area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of a modified advanced encryption standard algorithm","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Communication, Computer, Power, and Control Engineering (ICECCPCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICECCPCE.2013.6998769","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Communication, Computer, Power, and Control Engineering (ICECCPCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982271/6998733/06998769.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCPCE.2013.6998769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a modified advanced encryption standard algorithm","conferenceDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998769/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14837951","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a modified advanced encryption standard algorithm","confLoc":"Mosul, Iraq","sourcePdf":"96p4651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038013S","chronDate":"17-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6982271","isNumber":"6998733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982271","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6998733","articleId":"6998769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6998774,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5633-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5632-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6998774","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Control engineering","Process control","Field programmable gate arrays","Hybrid power systems","Monitoring","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signals","block codes","cameras","channel estimation","chaos","cloud computing","cryptography","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","electrocardiography","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","Hadamard codes","hardware description languages","hybrid power systems","image coding","image colour analysis","infrared detectors","intelligent robots","neurocontrollers","object detection","OFDM modulation","power plants","programmable controllers","quadrature amplitude modulation","sensorless machine control","surveillance","telecommunication congestion control","velocity control","video streaming","WiMax","wireless sensor networks","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor array imaging system","fractional wavelet transform","programmable logic controller","solar tracking system","wireless mesh network","intelligent surveillance robot","photoplethysmogram","VGA system","Zigbee wireless sensor network","multihop ad hoc network","WiMAX","color image protection system","cryptosystem","cloud networking","channel estimation","Walsh-Hadamard code","OQAM","hybrid image compression","polynomial coding","block truncation coding","cloud computing","chaos based cryptography","voice encryption","GPU acceleration","object detection","video stream","CUDA","T-OFDM system","VHDL","cache controller","MIPS processor","routing protocols","hybrid power system","ECG signal","noise canceller","path congestion control","wavenet","beam array patterns","encryption standard algorithm","FPGA","chip-level multi-access system","neurofuzzy controller","DC motor","sensorless speed control","double circuit transmission line","camera based monitoring system","infrared sensor","three-phase rectifier","audio signals","discrete cosine transform","interruptible soft core processor system","hybrid renewable power plant"]}],"abstract":"The following topics are dealt with: hybrid renewable power plant;

The algorithm is based on a piecewise linear (PWL) approximation of the transform curve combined with a PWL approximation of a scaled version of a normalized segment error. The architecture presented achieves 23 bits of fractional precision while using just one 18K-bit block RAM (BRAM), and synthesis results indicate operating frequencies of 93 and 110 MHz when implemented on Xilinx Spartan3 and Spartan6 devices, respectively. Memory requirements are reduced by exploiting the symmetrical properties of the normalized error curve, allowing it to be more efficiently implemented using the combinatorial logic available in the reconfigurable fabric instead of using a second BRAM inefficiently. The same principles can be also adapted to applications where higher accuracy is needed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits and systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

of Service Provisioning for Real-Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"In this paper the problem of Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for the Real-Time secondary traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) is investigated. Supporting the Real-Time (RT) traffic in CRNs is a complicated task which requires elaborate consideration in different aspects of the network. Here we consider a practical model for the network. Furthermore, a novel packet scheduling scheme is proposed which can efficiently provide the QoS requirements of the RT Secondary Users (SUs). The variations of the SNR of wireless frequency channels which result in variable transmission rates on the channels are also taken into account in the proposed scheme. The resulting QoS parameters of the RT SUs are calculated analytically. The obtained results are also verified by simulations. The results provide helpful insight for the support of RT traffic in CRNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2014","volume":"19","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"14981328","publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998836/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Service Provisioning for Real-Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of Service Provisioning for Real-Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-mahdavi-2386313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056009S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7055954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7055954","articleId":"6998836","onlineDate":"25 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6998838,"authors":[{"name":"Gr\u00e9goire Mesnil","affiliation":["University of Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada","University of Rouen, Mont-Saint-Aignan, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7050384/6998838/6998838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gr\u00e9goire Mesnil is a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of Montr\u00e9al in Canada and the University of Rouen in France.

In this paper, we propose to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for this task, and present several novel architectures designed to efficiently model past and future temporal dependencies. Specifically, we implemented and compared several important RNN architectures, including Elman, Jordan, and hybrid variants. To facilitate reproducibility, we implemented these networks with the publicly available Theano neural network toolkit and completed experiments on the well-known airline travel information system (ATIS) benchmark. In addition, we compared the approaches on two custom SLU data sets from the entertainment and movies domains. Our results show that the RNN-based models outperform the conditional random field (CRF) baseline by 2% in absolute error reduction on the ATIS benchmark. We improve the state-of-the-art by 0.5% in the Entertainment domain, and 6.7% for the movies domain.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7050384/06998838.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Recurrent Neural Networks for Slot Filling in Spoken Language Understanding","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2014.2383614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7050384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2014.2383614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Using Recurrent Neural Networks for Slot Filling in Spoken Language Understanding","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14948587","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6998838/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Compute Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Recurrent Neural Networks for Slot Filling in Spoken Language Understanding","sourcePdf":"taslp-he-2383614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111394S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7050384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"7050384","articleId":"6998838","onlineDate":"25 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998844,"authors":[{"name":"Sivanagaraja Tatinati","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, College of IT Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7008577/6998844/tatin-2381495-small.gif","p":["Sivanagaraja Tatinati (S\u201913) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Acharya Nagarjuna University, Guntur, India, in 2010.

The FPGA-based simulator captures the fine-grained interactions between the CUT and EDAC for the evaluation of the effectiveness of EDAC and its tuning. The simulator is constructed based on parameterized models, making it general purpose and widely applicable. We demonstrate the capability of this simulator in the evaluation of two popular pipeline-level EDAC designs, i.e., preedge EDAC and postedge EDAC, using synthesized processors that operate under generic error and noise models.

In this paper, a novel DPA topology with neither the impedance inverting network nor offset lines is proposed. This topology enables the enhancement of amplifier bandwidth and achieves a more compact amplifier size. To remove the impedance inverting network and to realize high efficiency at large back-off power level, the output-matching network of the CA is designed to realize high performance both at a low signal power level in the off-state of the PA and at the saturated signal power level. A 1.9-GHz series-connected load Doherty power amplifier without an impedance inverting network is designed and fabricated using GaN HEMTs. The amplifier achieves a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 50% under a 6-dB output back-off from a 34-dBm saturated output power with a PAE of 59%.

The aim of this paper is to derive stability criteria such that stochastic NNs with local impulsive effects are exponentially stable in mean square. By means of the mathematical induction method, several easy-to-check conditions are obtained to ensure the mean square stability of NNs.

The constructions are inspired by the recent discovery of Dimakis, Smarandache and Vontobel which says that parity-check matrices of good low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can be used as provably good measurement matrices for compressed sensing under l1-minimization. The performance of the proposed binary measurement matrices is mainly theoretically analyzed with the help of the analyzing methods and results from (finite geometry) LDPC codes. Particularly, several lower bounds of the spark (i.e., the smallest number of columns that are linearly dependent, which totally characterizes the recovery performance of l0-minimization) of general binary matrices and finite geometry matrices are obtained and they improve the previously known results in most cases. Simulation results show that the proposed matrices perform comparably to, sometimes even better than, the corresponding Gaussian random matrices. Moreover, the proposed matrices are sparse, binary, and most of them have cyclic or quasi-cyclic structure, which will make the hardware realization convenient and easy.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2386300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7017617/06998863.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7017617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2386300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic Constructions of Binary Measurement Matrices From Finite Geometry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic Constructions of Binary Measurement Matrices From Finite Geometry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998863/","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14881054","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998863/","volume":"63","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic Constructions of Binary Measurement Matrices From Finite Geometry","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2386300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143334S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7017617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7017617","articleId":"6998863","onlineDate":"25 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6998869,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Ketseoglou","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6998869/ketse-2382125-small.gif","p":["\nThomas Ketseoglou (S'85\u2013M'91\u2013SM'96) received the B.S. degree \nfrom the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, in 1982, the M.S. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, \nMD, USA, in 1986, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 1990, all \nin electrical engineering.

Our approach constitutes an interesting generalization of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation with Multiple Beamforming (BICMB) which has shown many benefits in MIMO systems. We start with a Pareto optimal surface modeling of the system and show the difficulty involved in the corresponding optimization problem. We then propose an alternative, practical technique, called Per-Group Precoding (PGP), which groups together multiple input symbol streams and corresponding receiving branches in the \u201cvirtual\u201d channel domain (after singular value decomposition of the original MIMO channel), and thus results in independent transmitting/receiving streams between groups. We show with numerical results that PGP offers almost optimal performance, albeit with significant reduction both in the precoder optimization and LDPC EXIT chart based decoding complexities.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2382125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06998869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2382125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","startPage":"2192","endPage":"2204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoding for MIMO With LDPC Coding and Reduced Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoding for MIMO With LDPC Coding and Reduced Complexity","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039157","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6998869/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoding for MIMO With LDPC Coding and Reduced Complexity","sourcePdf":"twc-ketseoglou-2382125-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073125S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6998869","onlineDate":"25 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998871,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wei","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cognitive Algorithm and Model, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wei","id":"37407449000"},{"name":"Xue-Song Tang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cognitive Algorithm and Model, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xue-Song","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086047227"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2267"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2275"}],"articleNumber":"6998871","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":944},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Object recognition","Laboratories","Image segmentation","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image representation","object recognition","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic-algorithm-based explicit description","object contour","shape representation","pattern recognition","object feature","shape category"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm (GA)","object recognition","shape representation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Models, Genetic","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]},{"kwd":["Genetic algorithm (GA)","object recognition","shape representation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998871","abstract":"Shape representation is an extremely important and longstanding problem in the field of pattern recognition.

This paper proposes a method based on genetic algorithms. The proposed method can be used to identify the most common contour fragments, which can be used to represent the contours of a shape category. The common fragments clarify the particular logics included in the contours.

Specifically, a probabilistic model for the secondary coexistence is developed, and, stemming from this, closed-form expressions of the coexistent interference probability are derived. The analytical results show that the coexistent interference is a non-linear function of the following key parameters: (i) the number of secondary networks roaming within a geographic area; (ii) the number of users belonging to each secondary network; (iii) the traffic pattern of each secondary network; (iv) the mobility pattern of each secondary network; (v) the interference range of each secondary network. The proposed analysis is crucial and preliminary for designing any coexistence protocol, since it discloses the intrinsic relationship between environmental and system parameters. Furthermore, closed-form expressions of necessary and sufficient conditions assuring that the coexistent interference is bounded by a given threshold are derived.

The accurate detection of facial landmarks improves the localization of the salient patches on face images. This paper proposes a novel framework for expression recognition by using appearance features of selected facial patches. A few prominent facial patches, depending on the position of facial landmarks, are extracted which are active during emotion elicitation. These active patches are further processed to obtain the salient patches which contain discriminative features for classification of each pair of expressions, thereby selecting different facial patches as salient for different pair of expression classes. One-against-one classification method is adopted using these features. In addition, an automated learning-free facial landmark detection technique has been proposed, which achieves similar performances as that of other state-of-art landmark detection methods, yet requires significantly less execution time. The proposed method is found to perform well consistently in different resolutions, hence, providing a solution for expression recognition in low resolution images. Experiments on CK+ and JAFFE facial expression databases show the effectiveness of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/TAFFC.2014.2386334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165369/7046475/06998925.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7046475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2014.2386334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic facial expression recognition using features of salient facial patches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Automatic facial expression recognition using features of salient facial patches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998925/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14948838","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998925/","volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic facial expression recognition using features of salient facial patches","sourcePdf":"taffc-happy-2386334-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121899S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"7046475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"269","xplore-issue":"7046475","articleId":"6998925","onlineDate":"29 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6998926,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed design technique allows to maximize the radiation performance (field slope, amplitude, or even directivity) of both beam patterns over assigned directions subject to completely arbitrary masks for sidelobe bounds. Whatever the elements disposal and the array boundary, the overall problem is solved through a convex (quadratic) programming procedure. Moreover, if centrosymmetric antenna layouts are adopted, the synthesis is reduced to an even more powerful linear programming routine which preserves the solution uniqueness and optimality guaranteed by quadratic programming codes while dramatically decreasing their computational weight (and hence enabling the design of much larger planar arrays). The proposed approach also takes into account the need of reducing the complexity of the beam forming network (BFN), which is fulfilled by sharing part of the excitation amplitudes between the two radiation modalities. A set of numerical examples is reported and discussed to show the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Synthesis of Reconfigurable Planar Arrays With Simplified Architectures for Monopulse Radar Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2386359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7052428/06998934.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2386359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7052428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Synthesis of Reconfigurable Planar Arrays With Simplified Architectures for Monopulse Radar Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6998934/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14965409","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Synthesis of Reconfigurable Planar Arrays With Simplified Architectures for Monopulse Radar Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-rocca-2386359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063177S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7052428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7052428","articleId":"6998934","onlineDate":"29 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998944,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Han","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory (BWN-Lab), School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7103375/6998944/han-2386335-small.gif","p":["\nChong Han (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering \nand telecommunications from The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2011, and the master of science \ndegree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2012. \nCurrently, he is a Graduate Research Assistant in the Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory (BWN Lab), School of \nElectrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology.

The developed theoretical model is validated with the experimental measurements (0.06-1 THz) from the literature. Then, using the developed propagation models, an in-depth analysis on the THz channel characteristics is carried out. In particular, the distance-varying and frequency-selective nature of the Terahertz channel is analyzed. Moreover, the coherence bandwidth and the significance of the delay spread are studied. Furthermore, the wideband channel capacity using flat and water-filling power allocation strategies is characterized. Additionally, the temporal broadening effects of the Terahertz channel are studied. Finally, distance-adaptive and multi-carrier transmissions are suggested to best benefit from the unique relationship between distance and bandwidth.

Amongst others, this development is driven by an increasing number of subscribers exchanging larger and larger data volumes. This need of data capacity cannot be satisfied alone by raising the sheer number of communications satellites, but requires powerful individual systems, which operate reliably and are cost effective at the same time. In this context two requirements on the communications antenna are the provision of high directional gain and robustness in terms of beam stability. Classically, large unfurlable mesh reflector antennas in conjunction with feed arrays are adopted to illuminate a certain region on ground with high gain. An inherent problem of such reflector-feed configurations is that these systems are prone to feed element failures. In the worst case, this could result in a `blind' spot, where no communication is possible. This paper introduces a robust antenna concept, which combines the virtue of reflector antennas, namely the large aperture, with the advantage of direct radiating planar array antennas, which is the beam stability in the presence of element failures. In order to unfold its full potential this concept makes use of digital beamforming techniques, which allow to control the illumination in a flexible way.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reflector Antenna Concept Robust Against Feed Failures for Satellite Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2386301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7080962/06998948.pdf","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2386301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6998948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Reflector Antenna Concept Robust Against Feed Failures for Satellite Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6998948/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039358","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reflector Antenna Concept Robust Against Feed Failures for Satellite Communications","sourcePdf":"tap-huber-2386301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071895S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7080962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7080962","articleId":"6998948","onlineDate":"29 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998949,"authors":[{"name":"Alister Hosseini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7052428/6998949/6998949-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alister (S.

Dynamic consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) presents a significant opportunity to save energy in data centers. A VM consolidation approach uses live migration of VMs so that some of the under-loaded Physical Machines (PMs) can be switched-off or put into a low-power mode. On the other hand, achieving the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) between cloud providers and their users is critical. Therefore, the main challenge is to reduce energy consumption of data centers while satisfying QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a distributed system architecture to perform dynamic VM consolidation to reduce energy consumption of cloud data centers while maintaining the desired QoS. Since the VM consolidation problem is strictly NP-hard, we use an online optimization metaheuristic algorithm called Ant Colony System (ACS). The proposed ACS-based VM Consolidation (ACS-VMC) approach finds a near-optimal solution based on a specified objective function. Experimental results on real workload traces show that ACS-VMC reduces energy consumption while maintaining the required performance levels in a cloud data center. It outperforms existing VM consolidation approaches in terms of energy consumption, number of VM migrations, and QoS requirements concerning performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2014.2382555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7080963/06998956.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2014.2382555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Ant Colony System to Consolidate VMs for Green Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6998956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Using Ant Colony System to Consolidate VMs for Green Cloud Computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6998956/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2015","accessionNumber":"15036080","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Ant Colony System to Consolidate VMs for Green Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tsc-farahnakian-2382555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100401S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7080963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"7080963","articleId":"6998956","onlineDate":"29 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6998957,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro Javier Martinez-Ros","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Information Technologies, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7052428/6998957/6998957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alejandro Javier Mart\u0131\u00b4nez-Ros (S\u201911) was born in Cartagena, Spain, in 1981.

In spite of the various scheduling algorithms proposed for cloud environment, those are mostly improvements based on one algorithm. And it's easy to overlook limitations of the algorithm itself. Aiming at characteristics of task scheduling in cloud environment, this paper proposes a task scheduling algorithm based on genetic-ant colony algorithm. We take the advantage of strong positive feedback of ant colony optimization (ACO) on convergence rate of the algorithm into account. But the choice of the initial pheromone has a crucial impact on the convergence rate. The algorithm makes use of the global search ability of genetic algorithm to solve the optimal solution quickly, and then converts it into the initial pheromone of ACO. The simulation experiments show that under the same conditions, this algorithm overweighs genetic algorithm and ACO, even has efficiency advantage in large-scale environments.

Peptides are particularly interesting, as they exploit structural flexibility to modulate their biological function. Despite their small size, peptide modeling remains challenging due to the complexity of the energy landscape of such highly-flexible dynamic systems. Currently, only sampling-based methods can efficiently explore the conformational space of a peptide. In this paper, we suggest to combine two such methods to obtain a full characterization of energy landscapes of small yet flexible peptides. First, we propose a simplified version of the classical Basin Hopping algorithm to quickly reveal the meta-stable structural states of a peptide and the corresponding low-energy basins in the landscape. Then, we present several variants of a robotics-inspired algorithm, the Transition-based Rapidly-exploring Random Tree, to quickly determine transition state and transition path ensembles, as well as transition probabilities between meta-stable states. We demonstrate this combined approach on the terminally-blocked alanine.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization","Peptides","Space exploration","Proteins","Monte Carlo methods","Robots","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metastable states","molecular biophysics","proteins","radiative lifetimes","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-based methods","full characterization","energy landscapes","small peptides","biomolecules","proteins","structure-function studies","structural flexibility","biological function","peptide modeling","highly-flexible dynamic systems","conformational space","classical Basin Hopping algorithm","metastable structural states","low-energy basins","robotics-inspired algorithm","Transition-based Rapidly-exploring Random Tree","transition state","transition path ensembles","transition probabilities","meta-stable states","terminally-blocked alanine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy landscape","peptide","sampling-based method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999124","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979782/6999111/06999124.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based methods for a full characterization of energy landscapes of small peptides","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based methods for a full characterization of energy landscapes of small peptides","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999124/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999124/","accessionNumber":"14851134","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based methods for a full characterization of energy landscapes of small peptides","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"006B3679407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064331S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979782","isNumber":"6999111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979782","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6999111","articleId":"6999124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999173,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Costa","affiliation":["Faculdade de Engenharia, Universidade do Porto"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Costa","id":"37085391390"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o P.

Techniques that leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, which are often readily available, may decrease the amount of data that needs to be annotated to obtain a certain level of performance, as well as improve performance when large annotated resources are indeed available. Here, the development of one such method is presented, where semantic features are generated by exploiting the available annotations to learn prototypical (vector) representations of each named entity class in semantic space, constructed by employing a model of distributional semantics (random indexing) over a large, unannotated, in-domain corpus. Binary features that describe whether a given word belongs to a specific named entity class are provided to the learning algorithm; the feature values are determined by calculating the (cosine) distance in semantic space to each of the learned prototype vectors and ascertaining whether they are below or above a given threshold, set to optimize F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b2</sub>\n-score. The proposed method is evaluated empirically in a series of experiments, where the case is health-record deidentification, a task that involves identifying protected health information (PHI) in text. It is shown that a conditional random fields model with access to the generated semantic features, in addition to a set of orthographic and syntactic features, significantly outperforms, in terms of F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-score, a baseline model without access to the semantic features. Moreover, the quality of the features is further improved by employing a number of slightly different models of distributional semantics in an ensemble. Finally, the way in which the features are generated allows one to optimize them for various F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b2</sub>\n-scores, giving some degree of control to trade off precision and recall. Methods that are able to improve performance on named entity recognition tasks by exploiting large amounts of unlabeled data may substantially reduce costs involved in creating annotated resources for every domain and every problem.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999199","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979782/6999111/06999199.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating features for named entity recognition by learning prototypes in semantic space: The case of de-identifying health records","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999199/","displayDocTitle":"Generating features for named entity recognition by learning prototypes in semantic space: The case of de-identifying health records","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14851144","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999199/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating features for named entity recognition by learning prototypes in semantic space: The case of de-identifying health records","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"081B4482075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075379S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979782","isNumber":"6999111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979782","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6999111","articleId":"6999199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999211,"authors":[{"name":"Quangang Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Ministry of Education Shandong University, Jinan City, China"],"firstName":"Quangang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085403896"},{"name":"Haidong Lan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Ministry of Education Shandong University, Jinan City, China"],"firstName":"Haidong","lastName":"Lan","id":"37085412142"},{"name":"Weiguo Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Ministry of Education Shandong University, Jinan City, China"],"firstName":"Weiguo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085405281"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5669-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6999211","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Pipelines","Instruction sets","Proteins","Runtime","Graphics processing units","Parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","molecular biophysics","molecular configurations","multiprocessing systems","parallel algorithms","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel PROSITE profile search algorithm","Xeon Phi","XPFS","protein domains","generalized profiles","GenBank","sequential architectures","protein sequence databases","Intel first generation Many Integrated Core product"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PROSITE profile search","generalized profiles","heuristic","dynamic programming","Xeon Phi"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999211","abstract":"PROSITE provides rich documentation entries describing protein domains, families and functional sites, associated patterns as well as generalized profiles to identify them.

In this paper, deep neural networks (DNN) are applied to model acoustic features in cough detection. A two step cough detection system is proposed based on deep neural networks(DNN) and hidden markov model(HMM). The experimental data set contains audio recordings from 20 patients with each recording lasting for about 24 hours. The performances of the newly proposed system were evaluated via sensitivity, specificity, F1 measure and macro average of recall. Different configurations of deep neural networks are evaluated. Experimental results show that many of the DNN configurations outperform Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on sensitivity, specificity and F1 measure respectively. On macro average of recall, 13.38% and 22.0% relative error reduction are achieved. The newly proposed system provides better performance and potential capacity for modeling big audio data on the cough detection task.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999220","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979782/6999111/06999220.pdf","startPage":"560","endPage":"563","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cough detection using deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cough detection using deep neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14851135","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6999220/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cough detection using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"102B2917942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053206S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979782","isNumber":"6999111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979782","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6999111","articleId":"6999220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":6999241,"authors":[{"name":"Arinze Akutekwe","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, De Montfort University, Leicester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Arinze","lastName":"Akutekwe","id":"37085365722"},{"name":"Huseyin Seker","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Digital Technologies, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Seker","id":"37329466400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5669-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6999241","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999241","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cancer","Support vector machines","Proteins","Biomarkers","Biological system modeling","Polynomials","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","belief networks","bioinformatics","biological organs","cancer","discrete wavelet transforms","DNA","enzymes","feature selection","inhibitors","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","liver","molecular biophysics","particle swarm optimisation","patient diagnosis","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization-based bionetwork discovery method","colorectal cancer diagnosis","machine learning techniques","automatic biomarkers discovery","predictive models construction","empirical mode decomposition","least square support vector machine","LS-SVM","discrete wavelet transform","DFT","support vector machine classifier","filter method","temporal relationships","two-stage biodiscovery approach","classifier-dependent embedded feature selection methods","temporal association modelling","dynamic Bayesian network","feature selection algorithms","generalization performance","serum protein profiles","colorectal cancer patients","support vector machine recursive feature elimination","linear kernel","stratified angiotensinogen","serpin peptidase inhibitor","IgA-inducing protein homolog","Bos taurus","Gem","nuclear organelle","Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein","liver cancer","cDNA sources","bowel"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999241","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979782/6999111/06999241.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","startPage":"8","endPage":"13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization-based bio-network discovery method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer","abstract":"Machine learning techniques for automatic discovery of biomarkers and construction of predictive models have been applied for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Strategies such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) have been proposed. Other methods using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DFT) and Support Vector Machine classifier have also been applied. However these methods adopt filter method of feature selection, which ignore interaction with the classifier, resulting in poor selection of features. They are also not able to detect temporal relationships among biomarkers that will aid better understanding of the disease. In this paper, we apply a two-stage bio-discovery approach which is a hybrid of classifier-dependent embedded feature selection methods, and modelling of temporal association of selected features using Dynamic Bayesian Network. Particle Swarm Optimization is also used to tune the parameters of feature selection algorithms for improved generalization performance. We demonstrate our method using the serum protein profiles of colorectal cancer patients. Results show that 21 features selected by the Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination with linear kernel had 99.09% generalization performance which outperforms that from previous studies. In addition, the analysis stratified Angiotensinogen (serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 8) that might inhibit IgA-inducing protein homolog (Bos taurus) and Gem (nuclear organelle) associated protein 2 might play inhibitory role against Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, which is also associated with liver cancer, and all having their cDNA sources from the bowel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999241/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14851249","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999241/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization-based bio-network discovery method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization-based bio-network discovery method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"123B4036086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056425S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979782","isNumber":"6999111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979782","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6999111","articleId":"6999241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6999245,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

In this paper, we propose a new genetic algorithm for solving the Euclidean distance geometry problem for protein structure prediction given sparse NMR data. Our genetic algorithm uses a greedy mutation operator to intensify the search, a twin removal technique for diversification in the population and a random restart method to recover stagnation.

Firstly, parameters are constructed which will generate Reference Curves (RCs) for chromatogram peaks. Secondly, the GRCM model is proposed to transform all these parameters to scalar values, which indicate the possibility for the HPLC-DAD data set containing chromatogram peaks similar to the RCs constructed by corresponding parameters. Then, the algorithm of mBBPSO is introduced to calculate the optimal parameters by minimizing the scalar values. Finally, the spectra are estimated. Through simulations and experiments, following conclusions are drawn: (1) the GRCMmBBPSO method can extract chromatogram peaks from the simulation data set without knowing the number of the compounds in advance even when a severe overlap and white noise exist; (2) the GRCMmBBPSO method can be applied to real HPLC-DAD data set.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999316","startPage":"26","endPage":"29","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979782/6999111/06999316.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separation model of Generalized Reference Curve Measurement for HPLC-DAD and it solution by multi-target Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compounds","Mathematical model","Data models","Particle swarm optimization","Educational institutions","Algorithm design and analysis","Bones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bone","chromatography","medical computing","orthopaedics","particle swarm optimisation","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["separation model","generalized reference curve measurement","multitarget bare bone particle swarm optimization","chromatogram peaks","chromatogram spectra","high performance liquid chromatography","diode array detector data set","HPLC-DAD data set","scalar values","optimal parameters","GRCMmBBPSO method","simulation data","white noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HPLC-DAD separation","Generalized Reference Curve Measurement model","multi-target Bare Bones PSO algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Separation model of Generalized Reference Curve Measurement for HPLC-DAD and it solution by multi-target Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999316/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14851205","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separation model of Generalized Reference Curve Measurement for HPLC-DAD and it solution by multi-target Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"198B2754275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049088S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979782","isNumber":"6999111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979782","xplore-issue":"6999111","articleId":"6999316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6999320,"authors":[{"name":"Heng Weng","affiliation":["Department of Big Medical, Data Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"Weng","id":"37085364942"},{"name":"Wenxin He","affiliation":["Department of Big Medical, Data Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wenxin","lastName":"He","id":"37085481424"},{"name":"Aihua Ou","affiliation":["Department of Big Medical, Data Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Aihua","lastName":"Ou","id":"38235307300"},{"name":"Lili Deng","affiliation":["Department of Big Medical, Data Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Deng","id":"37085360177"},{"name":"Chong He","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"He","id":"37085481536"},{"name":"Huihui Li","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Huihui","lastName":"Li","id":"37085498231"},{"name":"Shixing Yan","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shixing","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085496570"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5669-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6999320","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"abstract":"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has accumulated amount of literature with a total of 1,059 volumes, more than 190,000 chapters, and more than 120,000,000 words during the last 2000 years.

When highly sensitive data is involved, an organization may resort to air-gap isolation, in which there is no networking connection between the inner network and the external world. While infiltrating an air-gapped network has been proven feasible in recent years (e.g., Stuxnet), data exfiltration from an air-gapped network is still considered to be one of the most challenging phases of an advanced cyber-attack. In this paper we present \"AirHopper\", a bifurcated malware that bridges the air-gap between an isolated network and nearby infected mobile phones using FM signals. While it is known that software can intentionally create radio emissions from a video display unit, this is the first time that mobile phones are considered in an attack model as the intended receivers of maliciously crafted radio signals. We examine the attack model and its limitations, and discuss implementation considerations such as stealth and modulation methods. Finally, we evaluate AirHopper and demonstrate how textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from physically isolated computer to mobile phones at a distance of 1-7 meters, with effective bandwidth of 13-60 Bps (Bytes per second).","doi":"10.1109/MALWARE.2014.6999418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MALWARE.2014.6999418","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software: The Americas (MALWARE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software: The Americas (MALWARE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6987537/6999400/06999418.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AirHopper: Bridging the air-gap between isolated networks and mobile phones using radio frequencies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"AirHopper: Bridging the air-gap between isolated networks and mobile phones using radio frequencies","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999418/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14851491","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999418/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AirHopper: Bridging the air-gap between isolated networks and mobile phones using radio frequencies","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"RP0171570022045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051972S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6987537","isNumber":"6999400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6987537","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6999400","articleId":"6999418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6999503,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Mahmoodi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Mahmoodi","id":"37085447954"},{"name":"Hossein Nikaein","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Nikaein","id":"37085427809"},{"name":"Zahra Fahimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Fahimi","id":"37085444168"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999503","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis","Software","Indexes","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","field programmable gate arrays","genetics","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architecture","BLAST","basic local alignment search tool","DNA sequence searching","bioinformatics","Xilinx XC4VFX100 FPGA device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Sequence Searching","BLAST Algorithm","Hardware Implementation"]}],"abstract":"Undoubtedly, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool is one of the most prevalent algorithms in sequence searching and bioinformatics.

In conventional three-stage amplifier a differential feedback, from output of the second and the third stage is added to output of the first stage, which significantly improves Phase Margin and decreases compensation capacitor to less than 2% of the load capacitor value. Analyses show that the stability can be perfectly ensured. A three-stage amplifier has been simulated with and without a differential feedback in a 0.18\u03bcm CMOS. The proposed amplifier driving a 100pF capacitance load, achieved 1.39MHz gain-bandwidth product and 90\u00b0 Phase Margin with a 1.8V supply. An amplifier based on conventional nested Miller compensation (NMC) can just achieve less than 0.23MHz GBW with the same load, while using more than 100pF as compensation capacitor. So this method shows an improvement of a factor of 6 in GBW and reduction of a factor of 50 in the size of compensation capacitor.

In this paper two structures are presented for high-speed, low-noise and accurate applications. Both of the circuits are based on a positive feedback structure of two back-to-back inverters. First circuit is an improved rail-to-rail folded cascode amplifier in which an active bias circuit is utilized for rearranging the structure appropriate to the running comparison phase. Next circuit is a new comparator which is distinguished by its novel data reception style. In this circuit, PMOS transistors of the latch structure are constructed in separate n-wells, known as hot n-well. Inputs are applied to the bulks of the mentioned PMOS transistors via two differential pairs; hence due to isolation of regenerative outputs from bulks, a sensible attenuation in kickback noise value is observed. Despite the noted advantage, employing hot n-wells enlarges the active area of comparator. Another drawback of the proposed comparator is the necessity of utilizing extra capacitors in its structure. Although the capacitors are negligibly small, their construction should be without any tolerance, otherwise, any mismatch in their structure will enhance the total offset of the circuit. An advantage that can be noted for both presented circuits is the possibility of merging the evaluation phase with reset and latch sequences which leads to an intense increase in comparison speed. The comparators have been simulated using CSMC 0.35\u03bcm CMOS process model considering process variations, VDD noise of 100mVp-p, alterations in temperature and applying the inputs for testing the comparators in worst case. Simulation results confirm recognition of a differential input with 2mV pick-to-pick amplitude at as high a clock frequency as 800MHz with power consumption about 2.6mW for first circuit and a 1mV differential input with update rate of 1GHz and power consumption about 1.6mW for the low-noise structure of the second comparator. Layout results of the circuits apprize a 55\u03bcm \u00d7 13\u03bcm and a 24\u03bcm \u00d7 15\u03bcm active area for improved folded cascode comparator and the proposed novel structure respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999534","startPage":"209","endPage":"214","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999534.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed low-kickback-noise accurate comparators based on preamplifier-latch topology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"High-speed low-kickback-noise accurate comparators based on preamplifier-latch topology","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999534/","accessionNumber":"14839107","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999534/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed low-kickback-noise accurate comparators based on preamplifier-latch topology","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046162S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6999547,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Sedghi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Sedghi","id":"37085530730"},{"name":"Arash Ahmadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"38522809600"},{"name":"Elahe Eskandari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"firstName":"Elahe","lastName":"Eskandari","id":"37074022800"},{"name":"Ramiyar Heydari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"firstName":"Ramiyar","lastName":"Heydari","id":"37085484033"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999547","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Probabilistic logic","Biological neural networks","Mathematical model","Encoding","Biological system modeling","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","pattern classification","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","probabilistic spiking neural network","deterministic spiking neural network","back propagation classification algorithm","neuron models","neuron structures","linear neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probabilistic Spiking Neural Network (PSNN)","Spiking Neural Network (SNN)","Back Propagation Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999547","abstract":"This paper aims to present a comparison between probabilistic and deterministic spiking neural network for a back Propagation classification algorithm.

The simulation results show a precision of 90% 88% for the probabilistic and the deterministic networks correspondingly, which is in consistence with the similar results for linear neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999547","startPage":"274","endPage":"278","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999547.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance evaluation of probabilistic vs. deterministic spiking neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"A performance evaluation of probabilistic vs. deterministic spiking neural network","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999547/","accessionNumber":"14839156","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999547/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance evaluation of probabilistic vs. deterministic spiking neural network","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066309S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6999551,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Mazhabjafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Mazhabjafari","id":"37074788400"},{"name":"Mohammad Yavari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Yavari","id":"37269863600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999551","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":527},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Linearity","CMOS integrated circuits","Impedance matching","Noise measurement","CMOS technology","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","linearisation techniques","low noise amplifiers","ultra wideband technology","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly linear CMOS low noise amplifier","UWB applications","highly linear differential CMOS low noise amplifier","ultra-wideband applications","linearization technique","common-mode part","intermodulation components","RF-CMOS process","Spectre-RF","noise figure","differential common-gate LNA","frequency 2.6 GHz to 13.7 GHz","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra wideband","CMOS low noise amplifier","noise figure","distortion cancellation","common-mode current","IIP3","IIP2"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999551","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999551.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2.6\u201313.7 GHz highly linear CMOS low noise amplifier for UWB applications","abstract":"In this paper a highly linear differential CMOS low noise amplifier (LNA) for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications is proposed.

Accordingly designing more efficient logic gates, as the basic blocks of the VLSI chips, are essential for circuit designers. Since the integration reached to its limits through the conventional technologies mainly the CMOS based VLSI designs the quest for the novel promising technologies was commenced. Memristor is a passive element that has been fabricated recently and taken increasing attentions. Less area and non-volatility are the most important properties of this element. Also Memristors compatibility for fabrication over CMOS structures makes it as a breakthrough for the VLSI design enhancement. Memristor based logic computation are developed primarily. This paper presents a novel CMOS-Memristor based inverter with acceptable performance and also has nonvolatile output. This feature makes this circuit to be utilized not only as an alternative for conventional inverter circuit but also as a SRAM memory cell with the capability of input negation for specific applications. This includes a 0.18um PMOS and two Memristors.

Write-ability of proposed design is improved by cutting the feedback loop in SRAM cell and omitting the challenging inverters effect during write state by adding a T-Gate. This T-Gate is opaque during write operation and transparent for rest of operations. Due to improved write operation, it is possible to choose minimum size access transistors to remove access transistor sizing conflict of conventional 6T SRAM cell. As a result, read stability will be improved. Added T-Gate in the middle of the cell helps to better transferring both of logic-1 and 0 that leads to having full swing at the internal nodes of SRAM cell. As a result leakage power of proposed cell is improved over the previous design introduced in [1]. Simulation results show that proposed design improves leakage power of single cell by 38% at T=110\u00b0C and at VDD=500mV over that design.

In the proposed DDFS we developed a new structure for the ROM section that makes it to give us the sine and cosine digital output signals simultaneously by used of just one lookup table in an efficient way.

Breath analysis for early detection of different diseases is important owing to its numerous advantages over other diagnostic techniques. In this paper, we introduce a simple, inexpensive and disposable device capable of discriminating between 8 important biomarkers by monitoring their flow rates along a microchannel. The data related to the flow rates of different analytes are recorded as response patterns, and their discriminative information content is extracted with signal processing techniques and presented as feature vectors in a 3-D feature space. Discrimination among acetone, benzene, carbon monoxide, ethanol, hydrogen, isopropanol, methanol and toluene at wide concentration ranges in air is experimentally demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing biomarker gases by monitoring the flow rates in a microfluidic channel","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999586","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999586.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing biomarker gases by monitoring the flow rates in a microfluidic channel","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999586/","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839234","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing biomarker gases by monitoring the flow rates in a microfluidic channel","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07993S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999592,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Afkhami Ardakani","affiliation":["ECE Department, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hasan Afkhami","lastName":"Ardakani","id":"37085452715"},{"name":"Rasoul Dehghani","affiliation":["ECE Department, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Rasoul","lastName":"Dehghani","id":"37283401700"},{"name":"Vahid Asgari","affiliation":["ECE Department, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Asgari","id":"37085469343"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999592","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Resistors","Gain","Simulation","CMOS integrated circuits","Poles and zeros","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","compensation","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation strategy","two-stage operational transconductance amplifiers","zero splitting","phase margin","unity gain bandwidth","active circuit","passive resistive circuit","frequency compensation circuit","RRHC structure","composite structure","CMOS technology","hybrid cascode compensation structure","size 180 nm","gain 100 dB","gain 105 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Composite Compensation","RHC compensation","RRHC compensatio","Zero splitting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999592","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999592.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compensation strategy for two-stage operational transconductance amplifiers based on zero splitting","abstract":"This paper presents a compensation method in which the phase margin and unity gain bandwidth of an Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) is improved by addition a(n) active/passive resistive to the frequency compensation circuit.

First of all, by using GA, the possibility of local minimum reduces and after specified iterations, PSO is used to improve optimization's speed and local tuning ability.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999628","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999628.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"699","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi objective design of stand-alone PV/wind energy system by using hybrid GA and PSO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multi objective design of stand-alone PV/wind energy system by using hybrid GA and PSO","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14838984","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6999628/","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi objective design of stand-alone PV/wind energy system by using hybrid GA and PSO","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116685S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6999630,"authors":[{"name":"Roozbeh Torkzadeh","affiliation":["Power System Planning Center, Esfahan Regional Electric Company, Esfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6971894/6999486/6999630/6999630-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roozbeh Torkzadeh (S'14) was born in Esfahan, Iran, on 1988.

Although the coordinated design of conventional CPSS-POD controller improves power system damping characteristics, applying practical advanced stabilizer of PID-PSS2B in coordination with the POD controller, for the first time, can contribute more effectively in damping of low frequency oscillations (LFOs).

Time domain simulations in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment performed on 2-area 4-machine (2A4M) power system over various perturbations reveal that superior enhancement in damping of LFOs is achieved by employing coordinated controllers of PID-PSS2B and POD in comparison with the CPSS-POD.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6999652/","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839281","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Introducing PID-based PSS2B stabilizer in coordination with TCSC damping controller to improve power system dynamic stability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing PID-based PSS2B stabilizer in coordination with TCSC damping controller to improve power system dynamic stability","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055257S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999679,"authors":[{"name":"Azita Ferdowsi Moeini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Azita Ferdowsi","lastName":"Moeini","id":"37085517322"},{"name":"Pouria Tajvar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Pouria","lastName":"Tajvar","id":"37085507921"},{"name":"Rajab Asgharian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Rajab","lastName":"Asgharian","id":"37085515279"},{"name":"Mehdi Yaghoobi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Yaghoobi","id":"37395840500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999679","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999679","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Benchmark testing","Optimization","Indexes","Educational institutions","Context","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","decision theory","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale problems","colonial multiswarm algorithm","particle swarm optimization","premature convergence problem","parallel swarms","meta-level decision system","migration strategy","local exploitation","conventional PSO","particle swarm central"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optimization","multi-swarm","large scale","migration"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we have introduced the colonial multi-swarm, an algorithm with modular characteristics that can be augmented on several existing variants of Particle Swarm Optimization to alleviate the premature convergence problem. Colonial multi-swarm ensures a decent degree of exploration by administrating a number of parallel swarms.

This migration strategy helps preserve the local exploitation of thriving swarms as well as providing diversity and ground for emerge of other swarms. The module has been implemented on conventional PSO. The method is tested on 28 benchmark problems and has exhibited significant improvement over the original algorithm and also notable merits compared to the latest version of Standard PSO (SPSO 2011), presented by the particle swarm central, in large scale problems.

Whenever a Primary User (PU) appears on a licensed channel, the spectrum handoff procedure is initiated to interrupt the SU and the channel must be released for PU's transmission. In this paper, the rate of handoff occurrence is investigated and the preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queuing model is used to characterized the multiple handoff and data delivery time of SU. In this paper, when spectrum handoff occurs during the transmission of a SU's packet, the SU stops the transmission and this packet takes the higher priority rather than other SU's packets and when the PU's transmission is finished, this interrupted packet has higher priority to transmit. In fact, there are three classes of priority in this model. The highest priority is for PU's packets, the next priority is for interrupted packets, and the last priority is for normal packets of SU. In fact, the second priority queue is a feedback queue that interrupted packets return to this queue. In order to support the stability conditions of the system, by considering the effect of multiple interruptions on data delivery time of SUs, we study the stability region for arrival rate of SUs in this paper. The simulation results show the rate of handoff occurrence based on analytical and simulation results, and also show the stability region for SU's arrival rate considering handoff effects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999690/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14839041","publicationDate":"May 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999690/","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the PRP M/G/1 queuing system for cognitive radio networks with handoff management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the PRP M/G/1 queuing system for cognitive radio networks with handoff management","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057281S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999712,"authors":[{"name":"Negar Majma","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Naghshejahan Higher Education Institute, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Negar","lastName":"Majma","id":"37085348566"},{"name":"Seyed Morteza Babamir","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Morteza","lastName":"Babamir","id":"37662155800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999712","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999712","abstract":"White Box and Black Box testing are two major approaches to software testing where the former uses software source code and the latter uses software specification and focuses on testing functional requirements.

One of the challenges in these methods is the existence of narrow passages in the configuration space. To solve this problem, numerous sampling methods have been introduced in the literature. One of the issues of these methods is the large number of collision checking required to find a solution. In this paper, a sampling algorithm for reducing the number of collision checking is introduced. The proposed algorithm makes full use of all samples created in a configuration space. The basic idea is to generate new samples around a sample, only if there is contrast between the sample's class (collision or free) and its predicted class, which is the estimation of that sample's class by all the other samples. This method will give us a desirable sampling distribution around narrow passages and small obstacles in the configuration space. The results illustrate that the proposed algorithm makes substantial improvements over other well-known sampling algorithms in terms of reducing the number of required collision checking in the sampling phase.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999737","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","startPage":"1313","endPage":"1316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sampling algorithm for reducing the number of collision checking in probabilistic roadmaps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A sampling algorithm for reducing the number of collision checking in probabilistic roadmaps","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14838986","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6999737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sampling algorithm for reducing the number of collision checking in probabilistic roadmaps","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042008S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999744,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A neural network-based observer estimates states of the system and a neural network-based controller is designed to approximate input control signal. The estimated states by the observer are inputs of the controller and two neural networks (NNs) interact together such that the output of the system tracks the desired trajectory. Unlike most of the previous adaptive observers and controllers which employed linear in parameter neural networks (LPNNs), the proposed observer and controller are based on the nonlinear in parameter neural networks (NLPNNs). Hence, the proposed scheme supports global approximation property and is applicable to the systems with high degrees of nonlinearity. NNs learning rules are developed based on the well-known back propagation (BP) algorithm which has been proven to be the most relevant updating rule for control problems and despite most of the previous work by adding robustifying terms to the learning rules uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of all signals of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by Lyapunov's direct method. Finally, simulations performed on the \u201cgeneralized pendulum\u201d nonlinear system to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed observer-based tracking controller

Cognitive radio network is founded to provide the capability of sharing the wireless channel between unlicensed users (secondary users) and licensed users (primary users) in an opportunistic manner. Primary user detection in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime is one of the main challenges of cognitive radios that measure the energy level of the primary user for sensing the spectrum. SNR fluctuations due to wireless channel effects complicate this process further. This paper utilizes the potential benefits of cooperative spectrum sensing method in a way that it can become applicable when the primary user's SNR at secondary user receivers are low. The detection scheme is based on a set of evidences (primary-user's energy level) which are obtained from distributed cooperating nodes. After estimating the channel and the primary user signal statistics accurately, they are utilized to set up a MAP hypothesis test scheme for decision about channel occupancy. When the SNR of the received primary user signal at the secondary user's energy-detector is low, our results illustrate that utilizing just mentioned statistics can improve the performance of the energy detector significantly.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1447","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999760.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy-detection based cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm for faded and low-power primary user signal over cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6999760/","displayDocTitle":"An energy-detection based cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm for faded and low-power primary user signal over cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839032","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy-detection based cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm for faded and low-power primary user signal over cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117419S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999761,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Azimi Ahrar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba Azimi","lastName":"Ahrar","id":"37085438210"},{"name":"Seyed Ali Ghorashi","affiliation":["Cyber Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Ali","lastName":"Ghorashi","id":"37283596000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999761","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Radio spectrum management","OFDM","Femtocell networks","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","graph colouring","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation algorithm","power allocation algorithm","OFDMA based femtocell networks","intercell interference reduction","system capacity","graph coloring theory","iterative water-filling algorithm","frequency spectrum","resource allocation methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["femtocell","inter-cell interference","graph coloing","Water-Filling"]}],"abstract":"A frequency and power allocation algorithm is introduced in order to reduce inter-cell interference in an OFDMA based femtocell network in order to increase system capacity.

Simulation results show that the proposed frequency and power allocation algorithm can increase the system capacity about 15% with respect to traditional resource allocation methods.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999761","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999761.pdf","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel frequency and power allocation algorithm in OFDMA based femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999761/","displayDocTitle":"A novel frequency and power allocation algorithm in OFDMA based femtocell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839095","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999761/","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel frequency and power allocation algorithm in OFDMA based femtocell networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048699S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999766,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Olyaei Torshizi","affiliation":["Young Researchers Club and Elites, Mashhad Branch Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan Olyaei","lastName":"Torshizi","id":"37074505100"},{"name":"Hossein Sharifi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Sharifi","id":"37074315000"},{"name":"Azadeh Daneshgar","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Azadeh","lastName":"Daneshgar","id":"37085447320"},{"name":"Mohammad Ali Tinati","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Ali","lastName":"Tinati","id":"37396301400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999766","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Approximation algorithms","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","Hamming codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast convergence hybrid decoding algorithm","multidimensional searhing","regular LDPC code","finite geometry","syndrome vector","least hamming weight","iteration number reduction","robust sum-product algorithm","low density parity check code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","hybrid decoding","multi-dimensional searching","finite geometries"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new fast convergence hybrid decoding algorithm based on multi-dimensional searhing is proposed for decoding LDPC codes.

We initially obtain locally optimal (LO) detection rule for this problem which can almost completely suppress interference effect and combat \u03b1-stable noise to some extent using oversampling in the receiver or channel coding in the transmitter. Then, we derive a new low complexity suboptimal detector considering the LO detector characteristics. This detector suppresses the degradation in the system performance due to interferer which is more substantial than \u03b1-stable noise degradation. We demonstrate that for the new suboptimal detector we only require the estimation of the interferer level which in turn is accurately estimated blindly based on a small number of observation samples through the empirical characteristic function (ECF) calculation.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999784","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind nonlinear multiuser detection for CDMA signals in the presence of alpha-stable noise and strong cochannel interferer using empirical characteristic function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind nonlinear multiuser detection for CDMA signals in the presence of alpha-stable noise and strong cochannel interferer using empirical characteristic function","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999784/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839175","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6999784/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind nonlinear multiuser detection for CDMA signals in the presence of alpha-stable noise and strong cochannel interferer using empirical characteristic function","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051656S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999788,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser Eslahi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Babol University of Technology, Babol, Iran"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Eslahi","id":"37085414132"},{"name":"Ali Aghagolzadeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Babol University of Technology, Babol, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Aghagolzadeh","id":"37265014400"},{"name":"Seyed Mehdi Hosseini Andargoli","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Babol University of Technology, Babol, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mehdi Hosseini","lastName":"Andargoli"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999788","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","curvelet transforms","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curvelet transform","BCS","block-based compressed sensing image","fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm","FISTA algorithm","two-step iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm","TwIST algorithm","signal-to-noise ratio","PSNR","structural similarity index","SSIM index","quality assessor","ICT methods","information and communication technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Sparsity","landweber iteration","Accelerated Iteratitive Shrinkage Thresholdig","Iterative Curvelet Thresholding"]}],"abstract":"Due to the optimal sparse representation of objects with edges by the multiscale and directional Curvelet Transform, its application have been increasingly interested over the past years. In this paper, we investigate how the block-based compressed sensing (BCS) can be improved to an efficient recovery algorithm, by employing the iterative Curvelet thresholding (ICT). Also, we consider two accelerated iterative shrinkage thresholding (IST) methods, including the following: 1) Beck and Teboulle's fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA); 2) Bioucas-Dias and Figueiredo's two-step iterative shrinkage thresholding (TwIST) algorithm, to increase the execution speed of the proposed methods rather than simple ICT. To compare our experimental results with the results of some other methods, we employ pick signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) index as the quality assessor. Numerical results show good performance of the new proposed BCS using accelerated ICT methods, in terms of these two quality assessments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block compressed sensing images using Curvelet transform","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999788","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999788.pdf","startPage":"1581","endPage":"1586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"Block compressed sensing images using Curvelet transform","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999788/","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839249","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block compressed sensing images using Curvelet transform","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070596S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999792,"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Bahrani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Bahrani","id":"37085485900"},{"name":"Mohsen Eslami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37296955700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999792","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Channel estimation","Antennas","MIMO","Downlink","Channel models","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","channel estimation","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","multiuser transmission","multiple-input multiple-output cellular networks","very large antenna arrays","wireless link","pilot transmission","massive MIMO channel elements","time division duplex system","TDD system","pilot contamination","modified least-square algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Channel estimation is key to enabling effective multiuser transmission in multiple-input multiple-output cellular networks. Thanks to technology advances and a shift to higher frequency carriers, recently there is an increasing interest in using very large antenna arrays at both ends of a wireless link, which is known as massive MIMO. In this work the problem of reducing large overhead due to pilot transmission for estimating massive MIMO channel elements in the uplink of a time division duplex (TDD) system with pilot contamination is considered. Through an analytical framework, a modified least-square (LS) algorithm is proposed, which requires less numbers of pilots than number of unknown channel elements that does not sacrifice system performance.

This algorithm considers the location of users in the power allocation process. Furthermore, for inter-cell interference coordination, an interference graph is used. Using this graph, RBs are allocated to those users that do not experience severe interference in that RB. At the first, the user with the maximum average SINR is chosen and then the RB with maximum SINR (among those RBs that are not selected yet) is chosen. The power is allocated in three predefined levels according to the distance of users from their serving and interferer BSs. Comparing with traditional greedy algorithms, the proposed algorithm utilizes more degrees of freedom in resource allocation process, and considers different power levels for different users according to their locations in the cell.

The aim was to investigate the problem of minimizing the overall transmission power of SUs, while keeping the probabilistic interference and power budget below the specified thresholds. The main advantage of using probabilistic interference constraint is that it does not require the instantaneous feedback channel between SU transmitters (SUTs) and PU receiver (PUR). Furthermore, allocated power to SUs was first calculated using mentioned algorithm. Second, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for all SUs was calculated based on allocated power and channel fading gains and then modulation level can be obtained based on calculated SNR and target bit error rate (BER).

Femtocells are envisioned to be employed in indoor environments to increase the radio coverage as well as the network capacity. Deployment of a large number of femtocells to collaboratively provide more indoor coverage in an enterprise environment imposes critical challenges in the physical layer design of such a network. Clearly, the coverage optimization of enormous femtocells in a centralized manner is a very cost effective solution. On the other hand, in LTE enterprise networks, each femtocell has a local knowledge (messages received from user equipments) of its own neighbor femtocells. For the above scenario, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Distributed Femtocell Coverage Optimization (ADFCO) algorithm in a LTE enterprise environment consisting of N femtocells. The ADFCO algorithm updates the TX power of femtocells and balances the traffic load of each user. In addition, the proposed scheme reduces unwanted handovers and decreases the coverage gaps and overlaps, while maximizes the overall system's capacity. Numerical results, supported by the modified version of the Femtocell Power management Interference Simulator (FePIS) and the realistic parameters in the ITU-R P.1238-7 standard, show that the ADFCO algorithm displays an 1.6 times improvement in the indoor coverage and 50% enhancement in the overall capacity when compared to the fixed TX power allocation scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999816.pdf","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1728","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive distributed coverage optimization scheme in LTE enterprise femtocells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Optimization","Interference","Handover","Signal to noise ratio","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","interference","Long Term Evolution","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive distributed coverage optimization scheme","LTE enterprise femtocells","indoor coverage","mobile operators","Long Term Evolution enterprise femtocell networks","radio coverage","network capacity","ADFCO algorithm","femtocell power management interference simulator","ITU-R P.1238-7 standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocells","coverage optimization","handover","traffic load balance","LTE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive distributed coverage optimization scheme in LTE enterprise femtocells","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999816/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839299","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive distributed coverage optimization scheme in LTE enterprise femtocells","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083748S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999820,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Javad Saber","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University G.

Here, we propose a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for CR networks in the presence of multiple smart PUEAs with spectrum sensing capability. In the proposed scheme, the sensing information of multiple smart PUEAs is combined at the attacker's fusion center (FC) and PUEAs operate based on the decision made at FC. Moreover, the sensing information of different CRs is optimally combined at the FC so as to maximize the cognitive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (CSINR).

Simulation results show that our proposed technique can effectively cope with the destructive effect of jammers and retrieve a sparse solution from the measurement data.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999822","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999822.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional sparse solution for bistatic MIMO radars in presence of jammers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional sparse solution for bistatic MIMO radars in presence of jammers","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999822/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839106","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6999822/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional sparse solution for bistatic MIMO radars in presence of jammers","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128358S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999824,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Dehghani Soltani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Amirkabir University of Technology Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Dehghani Soltani","id":"38468632300"},{"name":"Mohammadreza Alimadadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Amirkabir University of Technology Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Alimadadi","id":"38579259700"},{"name":"Hamidreza Amindavar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Amirkabir University of Technology Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Amindavar","id":"37271577500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999824","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Vectors","MIMO","Detectors","Computational complexity","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k-best sphere decoding algorithm","depth first sphere decoding algorithm","fixed bitrate","maximum likelihood detector","radius setting","radius updating strategy","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sphere decoding algorithm","K-best sphere decoding algorithm","Depth first sphere decoding algorithm (DF SD) and Maximum likelihood detector (MLD)"]}],"abstract":"One effective way to reduce the complexity of receiver is the utilization of sphere decoding algorithm. Sphere decoding algorithms, particularly sphere decoding algorithms which search in the depth first known as depth first sphere decoding algorithm (DF SDA), have a similar performance to maximum likelihood with almost an acceptable complexity. However, depth first sphere decoding algorithm has a variable complexity. K-best sphere decoding algorithms have a fixed bitrate and complexity but their performances degrade compared to maximum likelihood detector (MLD). Therefore, we proposed a hybrid sphere decoding algorithm which contains the desired features of both DF SD and k-best sphere decoding in this paper. In order to reduce the complexity of DF SD, we proposed the utilization of the initial radius setting and radius updating strategy. Using this approach, we are able to reduce the computational complexity of sphere decoding remarkably. Simulation results confirm that the performance of our proposed method is at least equal to the performance of k-best sphere decoding algorithm but with a lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999824","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999824.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999824","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid method to reduce the complexity of k-best sphere decoding algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid method to reduce the complexity of k-best sphere decoding algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999824/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999824/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839159","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid method to reduce the complexity of k-best sphere decoding algorithm","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067521S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999832,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Majidzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Majidzadeh","id":"37085543164"},{"name":"Mohsen Eslami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37296955700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999832","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Complexity theory","Measurement","Vectors","OFDM","Resource management","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","mobile computing","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal SDMA grouping algorithm","multiuser MIMO-OFDMA systems","wireless communication systems","multiple input-multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","space division multiple access","frequency allocation","time allocation","space resource allocation","mobile stations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation","Grouping algorithm","SDMA","OFDMA","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"Wireless communication systems based on multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) in combination with orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and space division multiple access (SDMA) are flexible, spectrally efficient and of high capacity.

However, finite block length performance of Polar codes is rather poor compared to other capacity approaching codes such as LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes. In this paper, we propose a concatenated scheme with a polar code as an inner code and a Reed-Solomon code as an outer code to improve the performance over the binary erasure channel. Since the error pattern at the output of the polar decoder is not uniform, it is necessary to carefully devise an interleaver to map those bits with higher error probability to certain symbols of the Reed-Solomon code. To use the proposed scheme on other symmetric channels, one has to redesign the polar code component using density evolution technique which may not be practical. We therefore use a simplified scheme where the design is achieved using the erasure channel code design. We then show that the proposed concatenated scheme outperforms polar codes as well as Spatially-Coupled LDPC codes of the same rate and block length on symmetric channels.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999836","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999836.pdf","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A concatenated scheme to improve the performance of polar codes on symmetric memoryless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"A concatenated scheme to improve the performance of polar codes on symmetric memoryless channels","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6999836/","accessionNumber":"14838973","publicationDate":"May 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A concatenated scheme to improve the performance of polar codes on symmetric memoryless channels","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052179S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6999840,"authors":[{"name":"V Fotohabady","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"V","lastName":"Fotohabady","id":"37945154600"},{"name":"F Said","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"F","lastName":"Said","id":"37283594300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999840","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","OFDM","Bit rate","Encoding","Noise","Modulation","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","data communication","error statistics","mobile handsets","modulation coding","multipath channels","next generation networks","OFDM modulation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel delay spread effect","data transfer","high bit rate","multipath spread","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique","symbol transfer","next generation cell phone","MIMO channel coding","unisubcarrier system","COFDM","coded OFDM system efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Multipath spread is one of the most important factors which limit data transfer with high bit rate. Data transfer with high bit rate is possible in the range of gigahertz. The main problem in this frequency range is multipath spread. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique divides the transferring symbols between several subcarriers and transfers them simultaneously. Accordingly this technique is very resistant against the adverse effects of multipath spread. As a result of the increasingly grow of systems with high capacity, the uses of this technique increases cumulatively. OFDM system along with MIMO has been offered for the next generations of cell phones. Channel coding plays an important role in improving the efficiency of OFDM. Due to the special structure of OFDM, using channel coding in it, compared with uni-subcarrier systems, has special features which enhance the efficiency of the system. For this reason, this system is also called coded OFDM or COFDM.

Monotonic re-ordering (sorting) of the desired signal can increase its sparsity and consequently CS reconstruction efficiency. To use this, it is essential to estimate re-ordering operator which usually has been done by parallel imaging methods. These methods need regular sampling patterns which may not be optimum for CS reconstruction. We replaced the re-ordering operator by an invertible non-linear transform. The advantages of this approach are greater reconstruction speed, no need for preliminary reconstruction and estimation of the re-ordering operator and possibility of having an arbitrary sampling pattern. We successfully applied our approach to speed up cardiac cine MRI by factor of 2. This reduced the mean reconstruction error from 5.65% for standard CS to 5.41% and reconstruction time from 66.3 for CS plus re-ordering operator to 5.1 seconds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing cardiac cine MRI using invertible non-linear transform","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999851","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999851.pdf","startPage":"1903","endPage":"1906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing cardiac cine MRI using invertible non-linear transform","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999851/","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14839177","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing cardiac cine MRI using invertible non-linear transform","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047154S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6999858,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Soleimani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Soleimani","id":"37718173000"},{"name":"Mohammad Bavandpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Bavandpour","id":"38243713500"},{"name":"Arash Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"38522809600"},{"name":"Derek Abbott","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Abbott","id":"37273382400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4409-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4410-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6999858","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Neurons","Firing","Analytical models","Bifurcation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bifurcation","bioelectric potentials","biomembrane transport","brain models","neural nets","neurophysiology","piecewise linear techniques","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural dynamics","bifurcation analysis","piecewise linear spiking neuron models","membrane potential variables","input current","recovery variables","timescales","bifurcation phenomena","standard biological neuron models","time domain simulations","phase plane geometries","qualitative analyses","spiking patterns","parameter selection","PWL neuron models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiking Neural Network","Piecewise Linear Model","Bifurcation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999858","abstract":"In this paper we study the neural dynamics and bifurcation analysis of easily implementable piecewise linear (PWL) spiking neuron models with membrane potential variables, input current, recovery variables, and parameters describing timescales.

For this purpose, optimization technique has been used for reconstruction of 2-D images of dielectric properties and finally, early detection of the tumor location. The finite difference time domain method has been used for calculating the scattered Electromagnetic fields in the forward solver. The stochastic algorithm used in the inverse solver is Genetic Algorithm. To speed up the algorithm convergence, the dielectric parameters values have been divided into four intervals and the representative value for each of these intervals has been selected to be the average value of the interval. This work incorporates a new cost function to ameliorate the deficiencies existing in the other works. Simulated results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to its rivals in terms of both the convergence speed and the accuracy of the solutions. Afterward, in order to eliminate some potential problems due to the averaging of the dielectric constant intervals, the dominant soft and hard tissues of the image are obtained through a Neuro-Fuzzy model. Then, these equivalent values are used in optimization process. This method, not only yields the correct result in all cases, but increases the convergence speed compared to the previous cases as well.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999859","startPage":"1939","endPage":"1944","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999486","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971894/6999486/06999859.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early detection of breast cancer using genetic algorithm and Neuro-Fuzzy network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999859/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Early detection of breast cancer using genetic algorithm and Neuro-Fuzzy network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999859/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14839058","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2015","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early detection of breast cancer using genetic algorithm and Neuro-Fuzzy network","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058866S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971894","isNumber":"6999486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6999486","articleId":"6999859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6999910,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Mansourkiaie","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NF, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7110413/6999910/manso-2386799-small.gif","p":["\nFatemeh Mansourkiaie received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics \nand communications engineering from Iran, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

Routing algorithms that take into consideration the availability of cooperative transmission at the physical layer are known as cooperative routing algorithms. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing cooperative routing techniques, together with the highlights of the performance of each strategy.

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7110413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7110413/06999911.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Android Security: A Survey of Issues, Malware Penetration, and Defenses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Android Security: A Survey of Issues, Malware Penetration, and Defenses","volume":"17","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999911/","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2015","accessionNumber":"15143355","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TENACE PRIN"},{"fundingName":"Italian MIUR"},{"fundingName":"University of Padua"},{"fundingName":"Marie Curie Fellowship","grantNumber":"PCIG11-GA-2012-321980"},{"fundingName":"European Commission for the PRISM CODE"},{"fundingName":"Department of Information Technology, Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Android Security: A Survey of Issues, Malware Penetration, and Defenses","sourcePdf":"comst-gaur-2386139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162213S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7110413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"275","xplore-issue":"7110413","articleId":"6999911","onlineDate":"30 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6999913,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Pedro Guiomar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, University of Aveiro and Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Fernando Pedro Guiomar received the M.Sc. degree in electronics and\n telecommunications engineering from the University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal, in 2009, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

Applying a simplified Volterra series nonlinear equalizer (simVSNE), operating in the frequency domain, we demonstrate a reach extension of ~27% relatively to linear equalization. Due to its lower spatial resolution requirements, the simVSNE technique is shown to provide a more efficient NLE than the well-known back-propagation split-step Fourier method, both in terms of latency and number of complex multiplications per sample. The potential benefit of NLE for fully blind processing of high-order QAM optical signals is demonstrated by an incremental reduction of the RD-CMA penalty to <;0.04

However, existing wireless methods cannot eliminate reactive power sharing errors effectively, especially in load change situations. In this paper, a wireless reactive power sharing method that employs feeder current sensing and adaptive virtual impedance control is proposed for islanded microgrid. To improve reactive power sharing accuracy of virtual impedance method, an equivalent feeder concept is introduced, which can reflect the mismatch in connecting circuits equivalently. Through fast feeder current sensing, distributed generation units can calculate their respective equivalent feeders in real time. With the cooperation between real-time calculation and virtual impedance control, the proposed method achieves both accurate and fast performance in reactive power sharing. Compared with communication-based methods, the proposed wireless control provides the same high accuracy in reactive power sharing; meanwhile, its response speed to load change is much faster than that of other methods. Moreover, the proposed method can work as normal even though load changes during the transient process. Matlab simulation and real-time digital simulator test are used to validate the feasibility of this method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wireless Load Sharing Strategy for Islanded Microgrid Based on Feeder Current Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2386851","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7219485/06999925.pdf","startPage":"6706","endPage":"6719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2386851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999925/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Wireless Load Sharing Strategy for Islanded Microgrid Based on Feeder Current Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6999925/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15400694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407133"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M552446"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wireless Load Sharing Strategy for Islanded Microgrid Based on Feeder Current Sensing","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhu-2386851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112551S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7219485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7219485","articleId":"6999925","onlineDate":"30 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6999935,"authors":[{"name":"Yeongkyo Seo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7015642/6999935/seo-2377751-small.gif","p":["Yeongkyo Seo received B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea in Aug 2011.

First, the thermal model of the battery is developed and the characteristic parameters of the battery are tuned using the prediction error minimization method. Then, the tuned model is combined with a Kalman filter to estimate the temperature distribution of the battery under unknown initial values and model uncertainty.

However, the space earned from deduplication cannot be used as permanent storage because it must be reclaimed when deduplication is cancelled as a result of an update to the deduplicated data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel FTL scheme that enables the gained capacity to be used as permanent storage space for the file system layer. The proposed approach determines the safe amount of gained capacity that can be provided to the upper layer based on the compression rate prediction scheme. It then secures the required space by compressing cold data when capacity overflow occurs from cancelled deduplication. Our evaluation with a kernel source repository showed that the file system obtained approximately 79 percent additional capacity by the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/LCA.2014.2350984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCA.2014.2350984","startPage":"123","endPage":"126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/10208/7366618/06999953.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7366618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRACO: A Deduplicating FTL for Tangible Extra Capacity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec. 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"DRACO: A Deduplicating FTL for Tangible Extra Capacity","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 July-Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999953/","accessionNumber":"15683339","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999953/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2012R1A1A2A10038823"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRACO: A Deduplicating FTL for Tangible Extra Capacity","sourcePdf":"lca-seo-2350984-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052274S","chronDate":"July-Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"7366618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7366618","articleId":"6999953","onlineDate":"30 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6999957,"authors":[{"name":"Ilgyu Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7355269/6999957/choi-2386864-small.gif","p":["\n\nIlgyu Choi received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from \nYonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2009.","He is currently with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University.

In this paper, analytical methods are proposed to comprehensively compare the PhADC and the IQ ADC. Phase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions of the two ADC types are formulated analytically to facilitate a quantitative comparison of them. In comparison with the IQ ADC, the PhADC is a more compact quantization and demodulation solution when interference accommodation is not required. Moreover, considering a flash ADC as an example of the low resolution (3-4 bit) IQ ADC, the PhADC has a lower theoretical energy limit than the flash ADC for a given phase ENOB. IQ offsets and amplitude mismatch impose unique nonlinearities on the PhADC due to the nonlinear amplitude-to-phase conversion. The understanding of this nonlinearity leads to a phase-domain mismatch and offset detection technique. Phase SNR is explicitly related to input noise for both ADCs, and to comparator offsets for the PhADC, respectively.

The proposed BGR circuit consists of two BGR cores and a curvature correction circuit, which includes a current mirror and a summing circuit. Two BGR cores adopt conventional structures with the curvature-down characteristics. A current-mirror circuit is proposed to implement one of the BGR cores to have the curvature-up characteristic. Selection of the appropriate resistances in the BGR cores results in one reference voltage with a well balanced curvature-down characteristic and another reference voltage with an evenly balanced curvature-up characteristic. The summation of these reference voltages is proposed to achieve a high-order curvature compensation. This curvature correction circuit causes the proposed BGR circuit without any trimming to show a measured temperature coefficient (TC) as low as 4.2 ppm/\u00b0C over a wide temperature range of 160 \u00b0C (-40 ~ 120 \u00b0C) at a power supply voltage of 1.2 V. The average TC for 8 random samples is approximately 9.3 ppm/\u00b0C. The measured power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of -30 dB is achieved at the frequency of 100 kHz.

However, EGaIn residue, due to its fast oxidation, limits multiple movement of the EGaIn in the reconfigurable RF components. This paper focuses on the use of surfactants, carrier liquids, and microchannel coating materials that minimize EGaIn fragmentation and EGaIn residues on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based microfluidic channels during repeated actuation of an EGaIn plug. Using a combination of carrier liquids and microchannel coating materials to minimize EGaIn from leaving residues on the PDMS microfluidic channel, a microstrip transmission line switch as a proof-of-concept reconfigurable RF application using the EGaIn plug is demonstrated. It is switched ON<;4 dB and OFF with a loss of <;18 dB over the frequency range between 4 and 15 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2381555","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/84/7172569/06999969.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2381555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7172569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manipulating Liquid Metal Droplets in Microfluidic Channels With Minimized Skin Residues Toward Tunable RF Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Manipulating Liquid Metal Droplets in Microfluidic Channels With Minimized Skin Residues Toward Tunable RF Applications","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15327434","htmlLink":"/document/6999969/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-0846865"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-08-1-0329"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manipulating Liquid Metal Droplets in Microfluidic Channels With Minimized Skin Residues Toward Tunable RF Applications","sourcePdf":"jmems-koo-2381555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091971S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"7172569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7172569","articleId":"6999969","onlineDate":"30 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6999972,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Riverso","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7086423/6999972/river-2381093-small.gif","p":["Stefano Riverso (M\u201914) received the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic, computer, and electrical engineering from the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.","In 2010, he was a Visiting Student at the Institut Automatik, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, under the supervision of Prof. M.

Local controllers regulate voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling of each DGU, and they are able to guarantee stability of the overall ImG. The control design procedure is decentralized, since, besides two global scalar quantities, the synthesis of a local controller uses only information on the corresponding DGU and lines connected to it. Most important, our design procedure enables plug-and-play operations: when a DGU is plugged in or out, only DGUs physically connected to it have to retune their local controllers. We study the performance of the proposed controllers simulating different scenarios in MATLAB/Simulink and using performance indexes proposed in IEEE standards.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7086423/06999972.pdf","startPage":"1176","endPage":"1184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2381093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2381093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plug-and-Play Voltage and Frequency Control of Islanded Microgrids With Meshed Topology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Voltage control","Asymptotic stability","Mathematical model","Load modeling","Frequency control","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","decentralised control","distributed power generation","frequency control","power distribution control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plug-and-play voltage control","frequency control","islanded microgrids","meshed topology","decentralized control scheme","distributed generation units","DGU","voltage regulation","frequency regulation","point of common coupling","control design procedure","MATLAB","Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized control","microgrids","plug-and-play control","voltage-source inverters"]},{"kwd":["Decentralized control","microgrids","plug-and-play control","voltage-source inverters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Plug-and-Play Voltage and Frequency Control of Islanded Microgrids With Meshed Topology","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6999972/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15057475","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] Network of Excellence","grantNumber":"n\u00b0 257462 HYCON2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plug-and-Play Voltage and Frequency Control of Islanded Microgrids With Meshed Topology","sourcePdf":"tsg-riverso-2381093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091083S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7086423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"7086423","articleId":"6999972","onlineDate":"30 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6999981,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7066864/6999981/6999981-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joshua Liang received the B.A.Sc. degree in engineering science and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Canada, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

This paper establishes new indices that utilize readily available, real sensor information from the production line, such as buffer levels, machine throughput, etc., to find the machine that is the least energy efficient. This is the machine that causes the line to waste the most energy without producing parts. The energy structure of the production line is analyzed to better understand the complex system dynamics and to find the root cause of the energy inefficiencies. A baseline energy consumption is established, which is the least amount of energy that is needed to produce a certain number of parts on the line. Using this knowledge, the new sustainable manufacturing performance indicators are defined to properly monitor the performance of the line. These indices utilize the energy structure to illustrate the static (energy used when there are no downtime events) and dynamic (energy lost due to downtime) portions of the energy consumption. The concepts of the downtime energy bottleneck and the rated power bottleneck are introduced and proven analytically. These methods are verified using simulation studies in Simulink/MATLAB.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2014.2373821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2014.2373821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7447676/06999982.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sustainable Manufacturing Performance Indicators for a Serial Production Line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Sustainable Manufacturing Performance Indicators for a Serial Production Line","volume":"13","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6999982/","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15918142","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999982/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sustainable Manufacturing Performance Indicators for a Serial Production Line","sourcePdf":"tase-brundage-2373821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126457S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7447676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7447676","articleId":"6999982","onlineDate":"30 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6999984,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecomm.

To achieve good service quality for an MCS application, incentive mechanisms are necessary to attract more user participation. Most existing mechanisms apply only for the offline scenario where all users report their strategic types in advance. On the contrary, we focus on a more realistic scenario where users arrive one by one online in a random order. Based on the online auction model, we investigate the problem that users submit their private types to the crowdsourcer when arriving, and the crowdsourcer aims at selecting a subset of users before a specified deadline for maximizing the value of services (assumed to be a nonnegative monotone submodular function) provided by selected users under a budget constraint. We design two online mechanisms, OMZ and OMG, satisfying the computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget feasibility, truthfulness, consumer sovereignty, and constant competitiveness under the zero arrival-departure interval case and a more general case, respectively. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our online mechanisms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Budget-Feasible Online Incentive Mechanisms for Crowdsourcing Tasks Truthfully","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2014.2379281","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7452693/06999984.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2379281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6999984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6999984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Budget-Feasible Online Incentive Mechanisms for Crowdsourcing Tasks Truthfully","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6999984/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15935263","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61332005 and 61133015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Budget-Feasible Online Incentive Mechanisms for Crowdsourcing Tasks Truthfully","sourcePdf":"tnet-ma-2379281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191656S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7452693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"7452693","articleId":"6999984","onlineDate":"30 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"}]
