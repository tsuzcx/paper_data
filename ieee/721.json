Both single-hop and multi-hop cases are considered. For the single-hop scenario, a binary integer programming problem is formulated by incorporating a general interference model for directional transmissions and a Markov chain-based blockage model. Two effective solution algorithms are proposed, including a greedy algorithm that maximizes the instant throughput for each time slot, and a column generation-based algorithm that iteratively improves the current link schedule. For the multi-hop scenario, we develop a more complicated problem formulation incorporating both route selection and flow conservation constraints. We also develop an effective algorithm to solve the multi-hop problem. The performance of the proposed algorithms is validated with simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2470563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2470563","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1449","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07210127.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Link Scheduling Under Blockage and Interference in 60-GHz Ad Hoc Networks","topic":"Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"On Link Scheduling Under Blockage and Interference in 60-GHz Ad Hoc Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210127/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15422973","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210127/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1247955, CNS-1320472 and CNS-1320664"},{"fundingName":"Wireless Engineering Research and Education Center (WEREC), Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On Link Scheduling Under Blockage and Interference in 60-GHz Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"access-mao-2470563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09377S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks"],"articleId":"7210127","onlineDate":"19 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":7210136,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Lin I","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7210136/i-2469737-small.gif","p":["Chih-Lin I received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.

Algorithmic and architectural options and tradeoffs between performance and complexity/power dissipation are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on flexible (or reconfigurable) transceivers because of their importance as building blocks of software-defined optical networks. The paper elaborates on some advanced digital signal processing (DSP) techniques such as iterative decoding, which are likely to be applied in future coherent transceivers based on higher order modulations. Complexity and performance of critical DSP blocks such as the forward error correction decoder and the frequency-domain bulk chromatic dispersion equalizer are analyzed in detail. Other important ASIC implementation aspects including physical design, signal and power integrity, and design for testability, are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2016","volume":"34","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15786174","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7210138/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design Tradeoffs and Challenges in Practical Coherent Optical Transceiver Implementations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Tradeoffs and Challenges in Practical Coherent Optical Transceiver Implementations","sourcePdf":"jlt-morero-2470114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158479S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7404304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7404304","articleId":"7210138","onlineDate":"19 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7210140,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Kong","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Kong","id":"37085380261"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085390998"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["Southampton Wireless, School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS), University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"},{"name":"Hua Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085378253"},{"name":"Chunming Zhao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37287523600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7210140","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1657},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"The dual-hop hybrid RF/FSO relaying system, including the block diagrams of the relay node and the destination node.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"28KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7222813/7210140/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2470106.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7222813/7210140/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2470106.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio","Scattering","Relays","Modulation","Optical fiber communication","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave photonics","optical links","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic channel-dependent relay gain","fixed relay gain","signal-to-noise ratios","noncoherent frequency-shift keying","differentially encoded noncoherent PSK","M-ary phase-shift keying","atmospheric turbulence","mobile communication","free-space optical links","radio frequency links","dual-hop hybrid relaying system","average symbol error rate performance","generalized M-distributed channels","free-space-optical relay-assisted hybrid RF/FSO system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay","atmospheric turbulence","free space optical communications","symbol error rate","hybrid RF/FSO"]},{"kwd":["Relay","atmospheric turbulence","free space optical communications","symbol error rate","hybrid RF/FSO"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the average symbol error rate (ASER) performance of a dual-hop hybrid relaying system relying on both radio frequency (RF) and free-space optical (FSO) links. Specifically, an RF link is used for supporting mobile communication, whereas an FSO link is adopted as the backhaul of the cellular infrastructure. Considering nonline-of-sight RF transmissions and a generalized atmospheric turbulence (AT) channel, the associated statistical features constituted of both exact and asymptotic moment-generating functions are derived in the closed form. They are then used for calculating the ASER of M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK), differentially encoded noncoherent PSK (DPSK), and noncoherent frequency-shift keying. A range of additional asymptotic expressions is also derived for all the modulation schemes under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). It is observed from the asymptotic analysis that the ASERs of all the modulation schemes are dominated by the average SNR of the RF link in the hybrid relaying system using a fixed relay gain, whereas in the relaying system using a dynamic channel-dependent relay gain, the ASERs of all the modulation schemes depend both on the average SNR and the AT condition of the FSO path. We also find that the fixed-gain relaying strategy achieves twice the diversity order of the channel-dependent relaying strategy, albeit at the cost of requiring a high power amplifier dynamic range at the relay node. Furthermore, by comparing the asymptotic ASERs, we calculate the SNR differences between the different modulation schemes in both the fixed-gain and channel-dependent relaying systems. Finally, simulation results are presented for confirming the accuracy of our expressions and observations.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2470106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7222813/07210140.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2470106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a Free-Space-Optical Relay-Assisted Hybrid RF/FSO System in Generalized --Distributed Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210140/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a Free-Space-Optical Relay-Assisted Hybrid RF/FSO System in Generalized <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Distributed Channels","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15430956","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7903319","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210140/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973)","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471114 and 61223001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council's Advanced Fellow Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance of a Free-Space-Optical Relay-Assisted Hybrid RF/FSO System in Generalized <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Distributed Channels","sourcePdf":"jphot-hanzo-2470106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104628S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7222813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7222813","articleId":"7210140","onlineDate":"19 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7210142,"authors":[{"name":"Katsunori Ebihara","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chiba Institute of Technology, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Katsunori Ebihara received the B.E. degree in computer science from\n Chiba Institute of Technology, Narashino, Japan, in 2014.

There also exists some technical challenges while simulating the networks of artificial spiking neurons. The existing studies use a Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) model to describe spiking dynamics and neuro-computational properties of each neuron. But they fail to address the effect of specific non-Gaussian noise on an artificial H-H neuron system. This paper aims to analyze how an artificial H-H neuron responds to add different types of noise using an electrical current and subunit noise model. The spiking and bursting behavior of this neuron is also investigated through numerical simulations. In addition, through statistic analysis, the intensity of different kinds of noise distributions is discussed to obtain their relationship with the mean firing rate, interspike intervals, and stochastic resonance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2464106","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2464106","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2093","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7542212/07210157.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

The basic idea is to split up the role of the transmit beamforming matrix according to the type of interference caused by each base station. It will be shown that, for a network of L base stations, the proposed method would result in achieving (L - 1) degrees of freedom per user and convert the multi-cell multi-user MIMO channel into a set of single-cell single-user MIMO channels.

To tackle this problem, inlet air with moderate temperature and server consolidation are widely adopted. However, the benefit of these two methods is limited due to conventional air cooling system ineffectiveness caused by recirculation and low heat capacity. To address this problem, hybrid air and liquid cooling, as a practical and inexpensive approach, has been introduced. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the impact of server consolidation and temperature of cooling water on the total electricity and server maintenance costs in hybrid cooling data centers. To minimize the total costs, we proposed to maintain sweet temperature and available sleeping time threshold (ASTT) by which a joint cost optimization can be satisfied. By using real-world traces, the potential savings of sweet temperature and ASTT are estimated to be average 23% of the total cost, while 96% requests are satisfied compared to a strategy which only reduces electricity cost. The co-optimization is extended to increase the benefit of the renewable energy, and its profit grows as more wind power is supplied.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2462714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7752999/07210179.pdf","startPage":"1447","endPage":"1458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2462714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operational Cost Optimization for Cloud Computing Data Centers Using Renewable Energy","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4267003/7752999/7210179-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210179/","displayDocTitle":"Operational Cost Optimization for Cloud Computing Data Centers Using Renewable Energy","volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7210179/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16496690","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1017961 and CCF-1422408"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Operational Cost Optimization for Cloud Computing Data Centers Using Renewable Energy","sourcePdf":"jsyst-peng-2462714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105126S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7752999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7752999","articleId":"7210179","onlineDate":"19 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7210182,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085636482"},{"name":"Cihan Tepedelenlio\u011flu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Cihan","lastName":"Tepedelenlio\u011flu","id":"37268523100"},{"name":"Habib Senol","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Senol","id":"37403634900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7210182","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Resource management","Relays","Antennas","Channel estimation","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data energy ratio","SNR","single antenna","convex function","concave function","MIMO two-way relay channels","optimal power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power allocation","training and data","MIMO","asymmetric case","two-way relay channel"]},{"kwd":["Power allocation","training and data","asymmetric case","two-way relay channel","mimo"]}],"abstract":"Power allocation between training and data in MIMO two-way relay systems is proposed, which takes into consideration both the symmetric and asymmetric cases of the two sources.

Privacy concerns become evident because there are a large number of private data by various applications in the smart city, such as sensitive data of governments or proprietary information of enterprises. To protect the private data, the proposed model uses the BGV encryption scheme to encrypt the private data and employs cloud servers to perform the high-order back-propagation algorithm on the encrypted data efficiently for deep computation model training. Furthermore, the proposed scheme approximates the Sigmoid function as a polynomial function to support the secure computation of the activation function with the BGV encryption. In our scheme, only the encryption operations and the decryption operations are performed by the client while all the computation tasks are performed on the cloud. Experimental results show that our scheme is improved by approximately 2.5 times in the training efficiency compared to the conventional deep computation model without disclosing the private data using the cloud computing including ten nodes. More importantly, our scheme is highly scalable by employing more cloud servers, which is particularly suitable for big data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","volume":"65","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15917857","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","publicationDate":"1 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7210184/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Privacy Preserving Deep Computation Model on Cloud for Big Data Feature Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"201202032"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1301253"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy Preserving Deep Computation Model on Cloud for Big Data Feature Learning","sourcePdf":"tc-yang-2470255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105939S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7447853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"7447853","articleId":"7210184","onlineDate":"19 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7210190,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Yang","affiliation":["GE Healthcare, Florence, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687316/7299736/7210190/zyang-2470092-small.gif","p":["Zhi Yang received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, the M.S. degree from Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA, in 2005, 2010, and 2014, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently a Lead Engineer with GE Healthcare, Florence, SC, USA.

This paper presents the design and comparative evaluation for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with distributed winding and concentrated winding, induction motor (IM), and switched reluctance motor (SRM) for an electric vehicle (EV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application. A fast finite element analysis (FEA) modeling approach is addressed for IM design. To account for highly nonlinear motor parameters and achieve high motor efficiency, optimal current trajectories are obtained by extensive mapping for IPMSMs and IM. Optimal turn-ON and turn-OFF angles with current chopping control and angular position control are found for SRM. Additional comparison including noise vibration and harshness (NVH) is also highlighted.

Although many research works have been previously reported on addressing the same problem, most of them made a very strong assumption that some meter measurements can be absolutely protected. To address the problem practically, a reasonable approach is to assume whether or not a meter measurement could be compromised by an adversary does depend on the defense budget deployed by the defender on the meter. From this perspective, our contributions focus on designing the least-budget defense strategy to protect power systems against FDI attacks. In addition, we also extend to investigate choosing which meters to be protected and determining how much defense budget to be deployed on each of these meters. We further formulate the meter selection problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which can be efficiently tackled by Benders' decomposition. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on IEEE test power systems to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of computing time and solution quality, especially for large-scale power systems.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2470218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

For validating our framework, we use the structure of a realistic MG that is simulated using real-historical data. The experiments reveal that the proposed framework significantly reduces the computational burden of a considerably complex multiobjective problem.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7792759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2464709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7792759/07210221.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"218","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2464709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Data Driven Adaptive Simulation Framework for Automated Control in Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Data Driven Adaptive Simulation Framework for Automated Control in Microgrids","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7210221/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16561171","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-13-1-0105"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Data Driven Adaptive Simulation Framework for Automated Control in Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-celik-2464709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070097S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7792759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7792759","articleId":"7210221","onlineDate":"19 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7210234,"authors":[{"name":"Anith Selvakumar","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Corp., Waterloo, ON, Canada","ECE Department, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7210234/7210234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anith Selvakumar (M\u201914) received the B.A.Sc. degree in Engineering Science (major in electrical engineering) and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, both from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.","He previously worked as a Radio Hardware Designer at BlackBerry Ltd.

To achieve the nanowatt range power consumption, a novel switching scheme is proposed, which can accomplish the first three comparisons without consuming any energy and thus improve the energy efficiency significantly. In addition, to boost the offset performance of the comparator working under low supply voltage, a detailed theoretical analysis of comparator offset voltages is made. Based on the analysis, the comparator is optimized by only adjusting transistor sizes without any particular offset cancellation. As a result, when the common-mode input voltage varies from 300 mV to 450 mV at a 0.6 V supply, the 3\u00d7\u03c3 offset voltage is optimized to be about 6 mV with a fluctuation of only 0.15 mV, as revealed by Monte Carlo simulations.

The exponential relationship between voltage and time in an RC circuit is exploited to implement a logarithmic voltage-to-time converter and an exponential time-to-voltage converter. These circuits are the time domain analogs of the voltage mode translinear circuits that exploit the exponential relationship between current and voltage in BJTs and subthreshold MOS transistors. Just as Kirchoff's voltage laws provide a natural form of addition for the voltage-mode translinear principle, the progression of time can also be a natural source of addition for the proposed time-mode analog of this principle. In this work a time-mode adder circuit is used to realize a translinear principle in time. This paper describes the theory behind this time-mode translinear principle. Furthermore, the design of nonlinear circuit functions, e.g., multiplication and power law, based on the time-mode translinear principle is described. Simulation and measurement results for a two-input single quadrant multiplier are presented. The chip was fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process with simulation results agreeing closely with experimental results.

The effective algorithm is verified by both simulated and experimental data which are sensed from multiple sensors in the wireless node.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Asia Pacific Conference on Multimedia and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194242/7210263/07210276.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 Asia Pacific Conference on Multimedia and Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/APMediaCast.2015.7210276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMediaCast.2015.7210276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7210263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of compressed sensing in effective power consumption of WSN for landslide scenario","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Terrain factors","Wireless sensor networks","Temperature sensors","Monitoring","Acceleration","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","effective power consumption","WSN","wireless sensor network","landslide monitoring","CS based algorithm","Fourier coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["landslide","wireless sensor network (WSN)","power consumption","compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Application of compressed sensing in effective power consumption of WSN for landslide scenario","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210276/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15384412","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of compressed sensing in effective power consumption of WSN for landslide scenario","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570077301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086836S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194242","isNumber":"7210263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194242","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7210263","articleId":"7210276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7210294,"authors":[{"name":"Farhan Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Farhan","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37881796800"},{"name":"Jechang Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jechang","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37278335600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8172-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8171-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7210294","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Image coding","Biological neural networks","Image reconstruction","Training","Artificial neural networks","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image reconstruction","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural networks","digital image compression","video processing tasks","image processing tasks","DNN architectures","logistic sigmoid neurons","hyperbolic tangent neurons","PSNR","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural networks","image compression","artificial neurons","logistic sigmoid neurons","hyperbolic tangent neurons"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210294","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being researched and employed as a solution to various image and video processing tasks.

Cloud computing data centers consume enormous amount of electrical power resulting in high amount of carbon dioxide that affects the green environment as well as high operational costs for cloud providers. On the other hand, reducing the energy consumption would negatively impact the SLA (Service Level Agreement) that is a crucial concern in any resource allocation policy. In this paper, we propose a novel power aware load balancing method, named ICA-MMT to manage power consumption in cloud computing data centers. We have exploited the Imperialism Competitive Algorithm (ICA) for detecting over utilized hosts and then we migrate one or several virtual machines of these hosts to the other hosts to decrease their utilization. Finally, we consider other hosts as underutilized host and if it is possible, we migrate all of their VMs to the other hosts and switch them to the sleep mode. The results indicate that our method as compared to the previously proposed resource allocation policies such as LR-MMT (local Regression-Minimum Migration Time), MAD-MMT (Median Absolute Deviation- Minimum Migration Time), Bee-MMT (Bee colony algorithm- Minimum Migration Time) and non-Power aware policy offers least power consumption and SLA violation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175889/7209078/07210303.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","doi":"10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICA-MMT: A load balancing method in cloud computing environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Power demand","Measurement","Resource management","Load management","Energy consumption","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","contracts","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load balancing method","cloud computing environment","ICA-MMT","energy consumption","data centers","cloud providers","service level agreement","resource allocation policy","imperialism competitive algorithm","virtual machines","LR-MMT","MAD-MMT","Bee-MMT","local regression-minimum migration time","median absolute deviation- minimum migration time","non-power aware policy","power consumption","SLA violation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"ICA-MMT: A load balancing method in cloud computing environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15384073","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICA-MMT: A load balancing method in cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"ICAMMTGhafari3620045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064289S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175889","isNumber":"7209078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175889","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7209078","articleId":"7210303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7210305,"authors":[{"name":"Haijiang Tai","affiliation":["DICIEAMA, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"],"firstName":"Haijiang","lastName":"Tai","id":"37085480367"},{"name":"Antonio Celesti","affiliation":["DICIEAMA, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Celesti","id":"37541986500"},{"name":"Maria Fazio","affiliation":["DICIEAMA, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Fazio","id":"37283378600"},{"name":"Massimo Villari","affiliation":["DICIEAMA, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Villari","id":"37275634400"},{"name":"Antonio Puliafito","affiliation":["DICIEAMA, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Puliafito","id":"37275612800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8172-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8171-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7210305","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":507},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Water pollution","Transducers","Water resources","Risk management","Rivers","Floods","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet of Things","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced water risk management","cloud computing","IoT","physical environment","Internet of Things","embedded systems","SIGMA project","wireless sensor networks","meteorological observatories","water observatories","seismic observatories","distributed risk management system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","IoT","sensor networks","risk management"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, the research and industrial communities are focusing their efforts on the adoption of Cloud computing for a massive interaction with the physical environment.

In this paper, we specifically discuss on how SIGMA enables users to manage risks related to water. In particular, we will discuss how the whole SIGMA stack works describing the whole process from the moment in which water sensed data (e.g., turbidity, speed, methane, dissolved oxygen, water level, etc) are collected from heterogeneous sensor networks to the moment in which the Cloud-based system uniforms and stores them for processing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated system for advanced water risk management based on cloud computing and IoT","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","doi":"10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210305","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175889/7209078/07210305.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"An integrated system for advanced water risk management based on cloud computing and IoT","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210305/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15384060","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated system for advanced water risk management based on cloud computing and IoT","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"integratedd.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0591S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175889","isNumber":"7209078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175889","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7209078","articleId":"7210305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7210306,"authors":[{"name":"Maram Abdullatif Aldakheel","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, KSA"],"firstName":"Maram Abdullatif","lastName":"Aldakheel","id":"37085648247"},{"name":"Sk Md Mizanur Rahman","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Riyadh Province, SA"],"firstName":"Sk Md Mizanur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085650054"},{"name":"Rasheed Al-Zahrani","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, KSA"],"firstName":"Rasheed","lastName":"Al-Zahrani","id":"37085643351"},{"name":"Eyas El-Qawasmeh","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, KSA"],"firstName":"Eyas","lastName":"El-Qawasmeh","id":"38273080500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8172-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8171-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7210306","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Encryption","Receivers","Organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security mechanism","cloud computing environment","Internet applications","cloud providers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","security","cloud-provider","split and merge"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays cloud computing is widely used to provide different kinds of services such as, maintaining data and applications, scalable processing, storing data, access management, employing virtualization and other internet applications to its user.

In fact, routing protocols in WSNs are different than those applied in regular ad hoc networks since energy consumption is rarely considered in the latter. Sensors' clustering is a class of protocols where sensors are gathered into classes and only a cluster head is responsible for transmission to the base station, thus, reducing energy consumption in regular sensors. The LEACH protocol is a clustering protocol that selects cluster head sensors based on their residual energy. LEACH-GA is a modified version of LEACH where the base station determines sensors' clustering based on a genetic algorithm method. In this paper, we introduce a protocol that exchanges roles between regular nodes and cluster heads in a round robin manner following the token ring methodology. The equi-distribution of cluster head burden over all sensors in the same cluster reduces the need of expensive periodic reclustering. In addition, an initial division of the WSN into domains of limited number of sensors is performed in order to reduce the GA search time. The domain memberships of edge sensors are handled through fuzzy logic based on the residual energy.","doi":"10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210317","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175889/7209078/07210317.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of energy consumption based on genetic algorithms optimization and fuzzy classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of energy consumption based on genetic algorithms optimization and fuzzy classification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15384057","publicationDate":"March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7210317/","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of energy consumption based on genetic algorithms optimization and fuzzy classification","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"OptimizationEnergyOmari3610907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073013S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175889","isNumber":"7209078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175889","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7209078","articleId":"7210317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7210320,"authors":[{"name":"Souhir Ghariani Bouaziz","affiliation":["Facult\u00e9 des Sciences Economiques et de Gestion de Sfax, MODILS, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Souhir Ghariani","lastName":"Bouaziz","id":"37076096700"},{"name":"Racem Mellouli","affiliation":["Engineering College, Umm Al-Qura University, Al-Qunfudah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Racem","lastName":"Mellouli","id":"37294601800"},{"name":"Abdelaziz Dammak","affiliation":["Facult\u00e9 des Sciences Economiques et de Gestion de Sfax, MODILS, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Dammak","id":"37885827500"},{"name":"Mohammad Al-Hassan","affiliation":["Engineering College, Umm Al-Qura University, Al-Qunfudah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Al-Hassan","id":"37085646806"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8172-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8171-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7210320","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210320","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Mathematical model","Linear programming","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","genetic algorithms","linear programming","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covering location problem","two-stage genetic algorithm","radio network","cellular mobile communication systems","wireless sensors networks","general covering problem","mathematical linear models","station assignment capacity","signal degradation constraints","genetic algorithm","GA","heuristic based base stations","BS allocation","mathematical models","GA methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["covering problems","location problems","wireless network","modeling","optimization","metaheuristics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210320","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175889/7209078/07210320.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New variants of the covering location problem: Modeling and a two-stage genetic algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, we are interested to develop new models with reference to classical ones existent for covering and location problems.

Through the literature [2], [3], several propagation channel models were developed at the end of designing a communication system according to the environment of propagation of the signal and the standard adopted by such entity. These models are characterized by the power - delay profile (PDP) that describes a well-defined environment. Through the PDP, we create a channel at some length characterized by complex coefficients in a chosen distribution. The problem in the communication system is how to get the channel coefficients at the end to extract the data sent. In this work, we will see the impact of the channel length, the pilot arrangement and the number of antennas on the error of the estimation and later on system performance.","doi":"10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209078","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175889/7209078/07210353.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability of the channel estimation for the wireless communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Estimation","MIMO","Fading","Delays","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","mobile communication","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation reliability","wireless communication systems","mobile networks","flow rate","space time coding block","STBC","propagation channel models","power delay profile","PDP","complex coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","LS","LMMSE","Channel","Estimation","Channel length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of the channel estimation for the wireless communication systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210353/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210353/","accessionNumber":"15384120","publicationDate":"March 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of the channel estimation for the wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"ReliabilitychannelMessaoudi3614201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075088S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175889","isNumber":"7209078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175889","xplore-issue":"7209078","articleId":"7210353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7210404,"authors":[{"name":"Sharad Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowie State University, Bowie, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sharad","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37396185100"},{"name":"Shanmukha Pranay Rajeev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowie State University, Bowie, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Shanmukha Pranay","lastName":"Rajeev","id":"37085666373"},{"name":"Phillip Devearux","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowie State University, Bowie, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Phillip","lastName":"Devearux","id":"37085378941"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7648-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7647-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7646-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7210404","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Computational modeling","Virtual reality","Computers","Three-dimensional displays","Buildings","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["educational institutions","groupware","helmet mounted displays","multi-agent systems","safety","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immersive collaborative virtual reality environment","university campus","virtual campus evacuation drills","virtual campus evacuation tours","campus safety","virtual online campus tours","Oculus Rift head mounted displays","experimental design approach","human behavior","emergency response","crowd behavior control","computer simulated agents","VR environment","autonomous agents","immersive VR head set","multiuser virtual reality environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["virtual reality","behavior simulation","evacuation","collaborative virtual environment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210404","abstract":"The use of a collaborative virtual reality environment for training and virtual tours has been increasingly recognized an as alternative to traditional reallife tours for university campuses. Our proposed application shows an immersive collaborative virtual reality environment for performing virtual online campus tours and evacuation drills using Oculus Rift head mounted displays. The immersive collaborative virtual reality environment also offers a unique way for training in emergencies for campus safety. The participant can enter the collaborative virtual reality environment setup on the cloud and participate in the evacuation drill or a tour which leads to considerable cost advantages over large scale real life exercises. This paper presents an experimental design approach to gather data on human behavior and emergency response in a university campus environment among a set of players in an immersive virtual reality environment. We present three ways for controlling crowd behavior: by defining rules for computer simulated agents, by providing controls to the users to navigate in the VR environment as autonomous agents, and by providing controls to the users with a keyboard/ joystick along with an immersive VR head set in real time. Our contribution lies in our approach to combine these three methods of behavior in order to perform virtual evacuation drills and virtual tours in a multi-user virtual reality environment for a university campus. Results from this study can be used to measure the effectiveness of current safety, security, and evacuation procedure for campus safety.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2015.7210404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2015.7210404","startPage":"84","endPage":"89","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7169724/7210375/07210404.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7210375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An immersive collaborative virtual environment of a university campus for performing virtual campus evacuation drills and tours for campus safety","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"An immersive collaborative virtual environment of a university campus for performing virtual campus evacuation drills and tours for campus safety","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210404/","accessionNumber":"15383989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210404/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An immersive collaborative virtual environment of a university campus for performing virtual campus evacuation drills and tours for campus safety","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078539S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7169724","isNumber":"7210375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7169724","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7210375","articleId":"7210404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7210423,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Mahmoud","affiliation":["The College of Information Technology, UAEU, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Mahmoud","id":"37085549030"},{"name":"Nader Mohamed","affiliation":["The College of Information Technology, UAEU, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37305018000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7648-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7647-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7646-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7210423","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":297},"abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used, in addition to the military, in various civilian applications. Some UAV applications may involve multiple UAVs working and collaborating together to achieve a common goal. Developing such applications is time and effort consuming due to the heterogeneity of UAVs and the complexity of the operations involved. These UAVs are usually monitored and controlled using peer-to-peer radio frequency communications. This requires either direct links between the UAVs and the ground station, or through multiple hops between them. This approach suffers from many limitations and it forces the user(s) to be at the mission location. In addition, it restricts the mission's area within the range of UAV communication. Overcome this issue, we propose a platform architecture that integrates the UAVs with the cloud computing paradigm, so that UAVs become as servers and part of the cloud. We modeled the UAVs in a Resources-Oriented Architecture (ROA); they provide their resources and services through the uniform interface RESTful HTTP. For distributed UAVs, we propose a broker architecture to separate the requester side from the provider side. The main purpose of this broker is to assign the requested tasks to the suitable available UAVs. The separation of responsibilities facilitates easier development of UAV applications on top of the platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7169724/7210375/07210423.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2015.7210423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2015.7210423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7210375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broker architecture for collaborative UAVs cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Collaboration","Monitoring","Cloud computing","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cloud computing","control engineering computing","hypermedia","mobile robots","telerobotics","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative UAVs cloud computing","unmanned aerial vehicles","resource-oriented architecture","ROA","RESTful HTTP","broker architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAVs","broker","cloud computing","RESTful","ROA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7210423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Broker architecture for collaborative UAVs cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7210423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15384044","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broker architecture for collaborative UAVs cloud computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1355S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7169724","isNumber":"7210375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7169724","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7210375","articleId":"7210423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7210427,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Buono","affiliation":["University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Buono","id":"37660869300"},{"name":"Alfredo Cuzzocrea","affiliation":["ICAR-CNR and University of Calabria, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Cuzzocrea","id":"37282811300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7648-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7647-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7646-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7210427","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Electronic mail","Clocks","Collaboration","Computers","Image color analysis","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative framework","time zones","activity patterns","visualization technique","data types","email","instant messaging","time windows"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Presence awareness","Distributed teams","Circular visualization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CTS.2015.7210427","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7169724/7210375/07210427.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2015.7210427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7210375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A collaborative framework for supporting combined visualization of activities across time zones","abstract":"Collaboration today is often done among people from different countries located in different time zones.

However, mobile compute capabilities are often underutilized. In this paper we consider how a collection of co-located devices can be orchestrated to provide a cloud service at the edge. Scenarios with co-located devices include, but are not limited to, passengers with mobile devices using public transit services, students in classrooms and groups of people sitting in a coffee shop. To this end, we propose the femtocloud system which provides a dynamic, self-configuring and multi-device mobile cloud out of a cluster of mobile devices. We present the femtocloud system architecture designed to enable multiple mobile devices to be configured into a coordinated cloud computing service despite churn in mobile device participation. We develop a prototype of our femtocloud system and use it in addition to simulations to evaluate the performance of the system showing its efficiency and ability to leverage the available devices' compute capacity. We contribute to a line of research on small, local and possibly private clouds.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.12","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214022.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femto Clouds: Leveraging Mobile Devices to Provide Cloud Service at the Edge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Femto Clouds: Leveraging Mobile Devices to Provide Cloud Service at the Edge","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214022/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15399706","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214022/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femto Clouds: Leveraging Mobile Devices to Provide Cloud Service at the Edge","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085974S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7214043,"authors":[{"name":"Sisu Xi","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Washington University in St. Louis"],"firstName":"Sisu","lastName":"Xi","id":"37968239800"},{"name":"Chong Li","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Washington University in St. Louis"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Li","id":"37070566800"},{"name":"Chenyang Lu","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Washington University in St. Louis"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280495900"},{"name":"Christopher D.

However, current clouds cannot provide real-time performance to virtual machines (VMs). We observe the demand and the advantage of co-hosting real-time (RT) VMs with non-real-time (regular) VMs in a same cloud. RT VMs can benefit from the easily deployed, elastic resource provisioning provided by the cloud, while regular VMs effectively utilize remaining resources without affecting the performance of RT VMs through proper resource management at both the cloud and the hyper visor levels. This paper presents RT-Open Stack, a cloud CPU resource management system for co-hosting real-time and regular VMs. RT-Open Stack entails three main contributions: (1) integration of a real-time hyper visor (RT-Xen) and a cloud management system (Open Stack) through a real-time resource interface, (2) a real-time VM scheduler to allow regular VMs to share hosts with RT VMs without interfering the real-time performance of RT VMs, and (3) a VM-to-host mapping strategy that provisions real-time performance to RT VMs while allowing effective resource sharing with regular VMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RT-Open Stack can effectively improve the real-time performance of RT VMs while allowing regular VMs to fully utilize the remaining CPU resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214043.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RT-Open Stack: CPU Resource Management for Real-Time Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Resource management","Virtual machine monitors","Cloud computing","Scheduling","Servers","Admission control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time cloud computing","CPU resource management","virtual machines","RT-Open Stack","cloud CPU resource management system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scheduling","openstack","rt-xen"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"RT-Open Stack: CPU Resource Management for Real-Time Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214043/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399636","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RT-Open Stack: CPU Resource Management for Real-Time Cloud Computing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115896S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214058,"authors":[{"name":"Pelin Angin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Pelin","lastName":"Angin","id":"37586356500"},{"name":"Bharat Bhargava","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Bharat","lastName":"Bhargava","id":"37271936600"},{"name":"Zhongjun Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongjun","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085397813"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7286-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"7214058","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":736},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Containers","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","optimisation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance mobile-cloud computing","self-cloning agents","battery life limitations","dynamic performance estimation","program component relocation","dynamic computation offloading model","low-overhead dynamic make span estimation model","cloud resource optimization scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile-cloud computing","autonomous agents","context","performance"]}],"abstract":"The rise of the mobile-cloud computing paradigm in recent years has enabled mobile devices with processing power and battery life limitations to achieve complex tasks in real-time. While mobile-cloud computing is promising to overcome the limitations of mobile devices for real-time computing, the lack of frameworks compatible with standard technologies and techniques for dynamic performance estimation and program component relocation makes it harder to adopt mobile-cloud computing at large. Most of the available frameworks rely on strong assumptions such as the availability of a full clone of the application code and negligible execution time in the cloud. In this paper, we present a dynamic computation offloading model for mobile-cloud computing, based on autonomous agents. Our approach does not impose any requirements on the cloud platform other than providing isolated execution containers, and it alleviates the management burden of offloaded code by the mobile platform using stateful, autonomous application partitions. We also investigate the effects of different cloud runtime environment conditions on the performance of mobile-cloud computing, and present a simple and low-overhead dynamic make span estimation model integrated into autonomous agents to enhance them with self-performance evaluation in addition to self-cloning capabilities. The proposed performance profiling model is used in conjunction with a cloud resource optimization scheme to ensure optimal performance. Experiments with two mobile applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for high-performance mobile-cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.48","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214058.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-Cloning Agents Based Model for High-Performance Mobile-Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214058/","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Cloning Agents Based Model for High-Performance Mobile-Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214058/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15399713","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Cloning Agents Based Model for High-Performance Mobile-Cloud Computing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072559S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214064,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago G\u00f3mez S\u00e1ez","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS), University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Santiago G\u00f3mez","lastName":"S\u00e1ez","id":"37085342743"},{"name":"Vasilios Andrikopoulos","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS), University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Vasilios","lastName":"Andrikopoulos","id":"37860379200"},{"name":"Roberto Jim\u00e9nez S\u00e1nchez","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS), University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Roberto Jim\u00e9nez","lastName":"S\u00e1nchez","id":"37085501037"},{"name":"Frank Leymann","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS), University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Leymann","id":"37320996200"},{"name":"Johannes Wettinger","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS), University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Wettinger","id":"37085398980"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7286-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"7214064","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"abstract":"The emergence and consolidation of container-based virtualization techniques has simplified and accelerated the development, provisioning, and deployment of applications for the Cloud.

As such, it provides an ideal tool for the purposes of cloudifying existing middleware solutions and offering them as part of larger PaaS offerings. As part of this effort, our investigation focuses on leveraging and evaluating a container-based virtualization environment towards enabling the assembly, provisioning, and execution of dynamically tailored instances to satisfy service middleware communication requirements of specific applications.

Since VM consolidation problem is strictly NP-hard, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem. However, most of the existing works deal only with minimizing the number of hosts based on their current resource utilization and these works do not explore the future resource requirements. Therefore, unnecessary VM migrations are generated and the rate of Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations are increased in data centers. To address this problem, our VM consolidation method which is formulated as a bin-packing problem considers both the current and future utilization of resources. The future utilization of resources is accurately predicted using a k-nearest neighbor regression based model. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of VM and host resource utilization predictions in the VM consolidation task using real workload traces. The experimental results show that our approach provides substantial improvement over other heuristic algorithms in reducing energy consumption, number of VM migrations and number of SLA violations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399667","htmlLink":"/document/7214068/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Utilization Prediction Aware VM Consolidation Approach for Green Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilization Prediction Aware VM Consolidation Approach for Green Cloud Computing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099975S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214076,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Marotta","affiliation":["CINI - Consorzio Interuniversitario, Nazionale per l'Informatica, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Marotta","id":"37085375389"},{"name":"Stefano Avallone","affiliation":["Electric Engineering and Information Technologies Department, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Avallone","id":"37271292400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7286-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"7214076","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Power demand","Resource management","Simulated annealing","Energy consumption","Linear programming","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","computer centres","green computing","power aware computing","simulated annealing","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing based approach","power efficient virtual machine consolidation","cloud computing paradigm","green computing awareness","energy consumption minimization","quality of service","big data centers","virtualization technology","environmental pollution","VM live migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["consolidation","VM live migration","cloud"]}],"abstract":"In the Cloud Computing paradigm there is an emerging Green Computing awareness, aimed at increasing the cost-efficiency of the underlying infrastructure. The pursued objective is to find the right compromise between the energy consumption and the perceived quality of service of the applications running in the cloud. Big data centers, along with the adoption of the virtualization technology, are increasingly experiencing the need to reduce consumption, because of both the environmental pollution and the economic concern. Among the novel techniques used to minimize the energy consumption wastefulness there is the Virtual Machines Consolidation, which leverages the VM live migration. The goal is to increase the overall cost-efficiency by reducing the number of active nodes. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal of a novel model for the consolidation problem and a Simulated Annealing based algorithm which solves it by evaluating the attractiveness of the possible VM migrations.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.66","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","startPage":"445","endPage":"452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Based Approach for Power Efficient Virtual Machines Consolidation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Based Approach for Power Efficient Virtual Machines Consolidation","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214076/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399729","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7214076/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulated Annealing Based Approach for Power Efficient Virtual Machines Consolidation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085711S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214080,"authors":[{"name":"Manar Jammal","affiliation":["ECE Department, Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Manar","lastName":"Jammal","id":"37085473642"},{"name":"Ali Kanso","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Ericsson, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Kanso","id":"37317988100"},{"name":"Abdallah Shami","affiliation":["ECE Department, Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Shami","id":"37276195300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7286-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"7214080","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":362},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214080","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Unified modeling language","Delays","Redundancy","Cloud computing","Degradation","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","scheduling","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CHASE","component high availability-aware scheduler","cloud computing environment","flexible integration","on-demand access","virtualization concept","cloud-hosted applications","multitier applications","business services","service level agreements","business functionality","OpenStack Nova scheduler","high availability-agnostic schedulers","redundancy-agnostic schedulers","OpenStack environment","runtime scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High availability","applications","components","virtual machines","outage tolerance","scheduling algorithms","recovery time","criticality","OpenStack","filters"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing promises flexible integration of the compute capabilities for on-demand access through the concept of virtualization.

Using CHASE, prior criticality analysis is conducted on applications to schedule them based on their impact on their execution environment and business functionality. This paper presents the advantages and shortcomings of CHASE compared to an optimal solution, Open Stack Nova scheduler, high availability-agnostic, and redundancy-agnostic schedulers. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed solution improves the availability of the scheduled components compared to the latter schedulers.

In remote health monitoring, acquired sensory data is transferred into a private or public cloud for storage and processing. While simple encryption techniques can assure data privacy in the case of private clouds, ensuring data privacy becomes a lot more challenging when a public cloud (e.g., Amazon EC2) is used to store and process data. We present an approach that eliminates data privacy concerns in the public cloud scenario, by utilizing an emerging encryption technique called Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). The ability of FHE to allow computations without actually observing the data itself makes it an attractive option for certain medical applications. In this paper, we use cardiac health monitoring for our feasibility assessment and demonstrate the advantages and challenges of our approach by utilizing a well-established FHE library called HElib.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.78","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214088.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilizing Homomorphic Encryption to Implement Secure and Private Medical Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Utilizing Homomorphic Encryption to Implement Secure and Private Medical Cloud Computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214088/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399635","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilizing Homomorphic Encryption to Implement Secure and Private Medical Cloud Computing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073835S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214096,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Wen","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Newcastle University"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085432604"},{"name":"Jacek Cala","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Newcastle University"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Cala","id":"38096389400"},{"name":"Paul Watson","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Newcastle University"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Watson","id":"37285240700"},{"name":"Alexander Romanovsky","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Newcastle University"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Romanovsky","id":"37273487500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7286-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"7214096","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Effective, Reliable, and Secure Workflow Deployment over Federated Clouds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Security","Entropy","Cloud computing","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","costing","data analysis","scheduling","scientific information systems","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost effective workflow deployment","reliable workflow deployment","secure workflow deployment","federated clouds","cloud-based applications","application requirements","workflow applications","Bell-LaPadula multilevel security model","security requirements","monetary cost","computing power","data storage","intercloud communication","scheduling algorithm","dynamic constraint algorithm","DCA","biobjective dynamic level scheduling","BDLS","e-Science central cloud-based data analysis system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Reliability","Security","Workflow","Scheduling","Cost"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214096","abstract":"The federation of clouds can provide benefits for cloud-based applications.

Secondly, we apply an extension of the Bell-LaPadula Multi-Level security model to meet application security requirements. Finally, we optimise deployment in terms of its entropy and also its monetary cost, taking into account the price of computing power, data storage and inter-cloud communication. To evaluate the new algorithm we compared it against two existing scheduling algorithms: Dynamic Constraint Algorithm (DCA) and Biobjective dynamic level scheduling (BDLS). We show that our algorithm can find deployments that are of equivalent reliability, but are less expensive and also meet security requirements.

Cloud customers can place restrictions on these services by specifying affinity and anti-affinity constraints. Load imbalance is one key issue that cloud data centers regularly face when running these services. Load imbalance arises when existing services are stopped either by the cloud customers or in the event of host power cycling. One way to achieve load balance in such situations is to perform load rebalancing. Load rebalancing is a process of migrating services among hosts to ensure uniform resource distribution. By doing load rebalancing, SLA violations due to resource shortages on over-utilized hosts can be mitigated. The benefits of load rebalancing come at the expense of migration cost. The presence of affinity and anti-affinity constraints make the load rebalancing challenging. In this paper, we focus on load rebalancing of services with affinity and anti-affinity constraints by applying a novel genetic algorithm. Our objective function aims at reducing the number of migrations and variation of available resources in the hosts. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves a good resource balance while being computationally efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214102/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15399730","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214102/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Constrained Genetic Algorithm for Rebalancing of Services in Cloud Data Centers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Constrained Genetic Algorithm for Rebalancing of Services in Cloud Data Centers","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069791S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7214105,"authors":[{"name":"Jiyeon Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Jiyeon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085497487"},{"name":"Hyong S.

Understanding operational behavior of Cloud is extremely difficult due to the heterogeneity of different technologies, virtualized platforms and complex interactions among the systems. Many of existing system models for Cloud are based on utilization metrics such as CPU, memory, network and I/O. Such system models are quite complex and their anomaly detection mechanisms are mostly based on threshold scheme. Utilization metrics exceeding a certain threshold would trigger an alarm. In fact, it is impossible to determine proper threshold for all anomalies. These system models fail to assess the state of the system accurately. We propose a novel anomaly detection system based on user perception rather than complex system models. In our Perception-Based Anomaly Detection system (PBAD), each component within multi-tier applications monitors response time and determines whether overall service response time is adequate. PBAD also locates the anomaly by analyzing component behaviors. PBAD masks the complexity of Cloud and addresses what matters, how user perceives the service provided by the Cloud applications. The key advantages of the proposed algorithm are simplicity and scalability. We implement and deploy PBAD in our production data center environment. The experimental results show that PBAD detects numerous types of anomalies as well as the combination of anomalies where existing systems fail.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.95","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214105.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PBAD: Perception-Based Anomaly Detection System for Cloud Datacenters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214105/","displayDocTitle":"PBAD: Perception-Based Anomaly Detection System for Cloud Datacenters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399616","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214105/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PBAD: Perception-Based Anomaly Detection System for Cloud Datacenters","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a678.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095559S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214127,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Merle","affiliation":["Inria Lille-Nord Europe, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Merle","id":"37667061600"},{"name":"Olivier Barais","affiliation":["IRISA-Inria Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Barais","id":"37312497500"},{"name":"Jean Parpaillon","affiliation":["IRISA-Inria Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Parpaillon","id":"37694495200"},{"name":"No\u00ebl Plouzeau","affiliation":["IRISA-Inria Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"No\u00ebl","lastName":"Plouzeau","id":"37085473140"},{"name":"Samir Tata","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom, UMR CNRS Samovar, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Tata","id":"37274584100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7286-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"7214127","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"abstract":"Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) proposes one of the first widely accepted, community-based, open standards for managing any kinds of cloud resources. But as it is specified in natural language, OCCI is imprecise, ambiguous, incomplete, and needs a precise definition of its core concepts. Indeed, the OCCI Core Model has conceptual drawbacks: an imprecise semantics of its type classification system, a nonextensible data type system for OCCI attributes, a vague and limited extension concept and the absence of a configuration concept. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a precise metamodel for OCCI. This metamodel defines rigourously the static semantics of the OCCI core concepts, of a precise type classification system, of an extensible data type system, and of both extension and configuration concepts. This metamodel is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), its structure is encoded with Ecore and its static semantics is rigourously defined with Object Constraint Language (OCL). As a consequence, this metamodel provides a concrete language to precisely define and exchange OCCI models. The validation of our metamodel is done on the first world-wide dataset of OCCI extensions already published in the literature, and addressing inter-cloud networking, infrastructure, platform, application, service management, cloud monitoring, and autonomic computing domains, respectively. This validation highlights simplicity, consistency, correctness, completeness, and usefulness of the proposed metamodel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214127.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"859","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Precise Metamodel for Open Cloud Computing Interface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Semantics","Computational modeling","Context","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","open systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open cloud computing interface","community-based open standards","cloud resources management","natural language","OCCI core model","imprecise semantics","type classification system","nonextensible data type system","OCCI attributes","metamodel","static semantics","OCCI core concepts","eclipse modeling framework","EMF","Ecore","Object Constraint Language","OCL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cloud Modeling","Open Cloud Computing Interface","Metamodeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Precise Metamodel for Open Cloud Computing Interface","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214127/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399666","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Precise Metamodel for Open Cloud Computing Interface","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063221S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214129,"authors":[{"name":"Bowen Zhou","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS), The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Bowen","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085689450"},{"name":"Amir Vahid Dastjerdi","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS), The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Amir Vahid","lastName":"Dastjerdi","id":"37681258100"},{"name":"Rodrigo N.

As automation tasks find their way into more and more smaller application areas where it is economically not reasonable to employ, engineer and maintain a full, hardware-based PLC, a cloud-based software PLC (Soft-PLC) can serve as a Control-as-a-Service solution. In this paper, we address the question how a Soft-PLC can be augmented with cloud-required aspects such as elastic scalability and multi-tenancy. We introduce an architecture that realizes these properties and allows for the implementation of a multi-tenant, horizontally scalable Soft-PLC. Furthermore, we evaluate the most important quality attributes, i.e. Roundtrip times and scalability of our architecture based on a prototypical implementation and a case study from the building automation domain. Finally, we present lessons learned and give an outlook to further realistic scenarios for cloud-based control in industrial applications.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.124","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214134.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud-Based Control: A Multi-tenant, Horizontally Scalable Soft-PLC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214134/","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-Based Control: A Multi-tenant, Horizontally Scalable Soft-PLC","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214134/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15399766","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-Based Control: A Multi-tenant, Horizontally Scalable Soft-PLC","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287a909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076955S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214137,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Lenk","affiliation":["FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik Friedrichstr. 60, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Lenk","id":"37304053100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7286-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"7214137","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machining","Operating systems","Standards","Software packages","Image restoration","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business continuity","business data processing","cloud computing","Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud standby deployment method","model-driven deployment method","disaster recovery planning","business process security","IT systems","Internet","cloud computing","distributed systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disaster Recovery","Warm Standby","Cloud Computing","Cloud Standby"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214137","abstract":"Disaster recovery planning and securing business processes against outtakes have been essential parts of running a company for decades.

Our goal is to enable generic computation offloading to heterogeneous devices that include Cloud, mobile devices, and cloudlets. We propose a generic and flexible architecture that maximizes the computation gain with respect to various objective functions such as, minimizing the response time, reducing the overall energy consumption, and increasing the network lifetime. This novel architecture is designed to automate computation offloading to numerous compute resources over disrupted network connections.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2015.163","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194474/7212169/07214173.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7212169","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Mobile Opportunistic Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Mobile Opportunistic Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214173/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399619","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7214173/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Mobile Opportunistic Computing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7287b111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05894S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194474","isNumber":"7212169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194474","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7212169","articleId":"7214173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214194,"authors":[{"name":"Petteri Kela","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Oy (Finland), Ltd., Helsinki, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7214194/kela-2470532-small.gif","p":["Petteri Kela received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland, in 2007.

In particular, a novel scheduling algorithm is proposed that achieves a more uniform distribution of user-throughput than that of the state-of-the-art maximum-throughput (MT) schedulers. The proposed scheduling algorithm also takes the coherence time of the channel into account as well as the impact to the acquired channel state information. A novel radio frame structure that is appropriate for achieving a 1-ms round trip time latency is also proposed. Such a low latency allows one to employ multiuser as well as cooperative multiple input multiple output schemes for mobile users. An evaluation of matched-filter and zero-forcing precoding for mobile users in UDNs is included. The performance of the proposed 5G UDN concept is assessed using a system-level simulator. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed borderless scheduling concept achieves ~77% higher median user-throughput than that of the MT scheduler at the cost of ~17% lower area-throughput. Such results are obtained for a high density of mobile users at velocities of ~50 km/h.","topic":"Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15422952","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2015","publicationDate":"2015","htmlLink":"/document/7214194/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Borderless Mobility in 5G Outdoor Ultra-Dense Networks","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Borderless Mobility in 5G Outdoor Ultra-Dense Networks","sourcePdf":"access-kela-2470532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111693S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks"],"articleId":"7214194","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7214197,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Amar\u00fa","affiliation":["I&C Faculty, Integrated Systems Laboratory, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7302610/7214197/amaru-2460377-small.gif","p":["\nLuca Amar\u00fa (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 2009.

The potentially large space for innovation has to be explored in the search for technologies that can support large-scale and high-performance circuit design. Within this space, we analyze a set of emerging technologies characterized by a similar computational abstraction at the design level, i.e., a binary comparator or a majority voter. We demonstrate that new logic synthesis techniques, natively supporting this abstraction, are the technology enablers. We describe models and data-structures for logic design using emerging technologies and we show results of applying new synthesis algorithms and tools. We conclude that new logic synthesis methods are required to both evaluate emerging technologies and to achieve the best results in terms of area, power and performance.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2460377","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7302610/07214197.pdf","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2460377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Logic Synthesis as Nanotechnology Enabler","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"New Logic Synthesis as Nanotechnology Enabler","volume":"103","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553338","htmlLink":"/document/7214197/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ERC-2009-AdG-246810"},{"fundingName":"SNSF-200021-146600"},{"fundingName":"NSF, STARNet SONIC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"New Logic Synthesis as Nanotechnology Enabler","sourcePdf":"jproc-amaru-2460377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.194876S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7302610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7302610","articleId":"7214197","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7214203,"authors":[{"name":"Kunimasa Saitoh","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Kunimasa Saitoh (S'00\u2013M'01) received the B.S., M.S.,\n and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, in 1997, 1999, and 2001,\n respectively.","From 1999 to 2001, he was a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Space division multiplexing (SDM) using multicore fibers (MCFs), multielement fibers, multimode fibers, and their combination; few-mode MCFs; or fibers based on orbital angular momentum are considered to be the propitious stepping-stones to overcome the capacity crunch of conventional single-core fibers. We critically review research progress on SDM fibers and network components, and we introduce two figures of merit aiming for quantitative evaluation of technologies such as amplifiers, fan-in/fan-out multiplexers, transmitters, switches, and SDM nodes. Results show that SDM fibers achieve a 1185-fold (18-fold) spectral-spatial efficiency increase compared with the 276-SMF bundle (single-core fiber) currently installed on the ground. In addition, an analysis of crosstalk in MCFs shows how SDM concepts can be further exploited to fit in various optical networks such as core, metro, and especially future intra-data center optical interconnects.

Enhancing image resolution is desired but has been very challenging in medical image processing. Super resolution reconstruction based on sparse representation and overcomplete dictionary has been lately employed to address this problem; however, these methods require extra training sets, which may not be always available. This paper proposes a novel single anisotropic 3-D MR image upsampling method via sparse representation and overcomplete dictionary that is trained from in-plane high resolution slices to upsample in the out-of-plane dimensions. The proposed method, therefore, does not require extra training sets. Abundant experiments, conducted on simulated and clinical brain MR images, show that the proposed method is more accurate than classical interpolation. When compared to a recent upsampling method based on the nonlocal means approach, the proposed method did not show improved results at low upsampling factors with simulated images, but generated comparable results with much better computational efficiency in clinical cases. Therefore, the proposed approach can be efficiently implemented and routinely used to upsample MR images in the out-of-planes views for radiologic assessment and postacquisition processing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7775117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2015.2470682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7775117/07214208.pdf","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1561","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2015.2470682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Anisotropic 3-D MR Image Upsampling via Overcomplete Dictionary Trained From In-Plane High Resolution Slices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Single Anisotropic 3-D MR Image Upsampling via Overcomplete Dictionary Trained From In-Plane High Resolution Slices","volume":"20","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7214208/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16521103","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","pubMedId":"26302522","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Chongqing graduate education reformation research project","grantNumber":"yjg133005"},{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"KJ1400409"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01 EB018988"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Anisotropic 3-D MR Image Upsampling via Overcomplete Dictionary Trained From In-Plane High Resolution Slices","sourcePdf":"jbhi-he-2470682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089564S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7775117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7775117","articleId":"7214208","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":7214219,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Peristerianos","affiliation":["Dept. of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Peristerianos","id":"37085729453"},{"name":"Argiris Theopoulos","affiliation":["Dept. of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Argiris","lastName":"Theopoulos","id":"37085722638"},{"name":"Anastasios.

To this end, an extension of the binaural multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF), namely the MWF-ITF, has been proposed, which aims to preserve the Interaural Transfer Function (ITF) of the noise sources. However, the MWF-ITF is well-suited only for directional noise sources but not for, e.g., spatially isotropic noise, whose spatial characteristics cannot be properly described by the ITF but rather by the Interaural Coherence (IC). Hence, another extension of the binaural MWF, namely the MWF-IC, has been recently proposed, which aims to preserve the IC of the noise component. Since for the MWF-IC a substantial tradeoff between noise reduction and IC preservation exists, in this paper we propose a perceptually constrained version of the MWF-IC, where the amount of IC preservation is controlled based on the IC discrimination ability of the human auditory system. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the binaural cue preservation capabilities of the binaural MWF and the MWF-ITF for spatially isotropic noise fields is provided. Several simulations in diffuse noise scenarios show that the perceptually constrained MWF-IC yields a controllable preservation of the IC without significantly degrading the output SNR compared to the binaural MWF and the MWF-ITF. Furthermore, contrary to the binaural MWF and MWF-ITF, the proposed algorithm retains the spatial separation between the output speech and noise components while the binaural cues of the speech component are only slightly distorted, such that the binaural hearing advantage for speech intelligibility can still be exploited.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15432911","htmlLink":"/document/7214220/","displayDocTitle":"Interaural Coherence Preservation in Multi-Channel Wiener Filtering-Based Noise Reduction for Binaural Hearing Aids","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaural Coherence Preservation in Multi-Channel Wiener Filtering-Based Noise Reduction for Binaural Hearing Aids","sourcePdf":"taslp-marquardt-2471096-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165259S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7243388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7243388","articleId":"7214220","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7214221,"authors":[{"name":"Dantong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7214221/liu-2470659_print-small.gif","p":["\nDantong Liu (S'13) received the double B.Sc. degrees (both with first class honors) in telecommunications engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, and Queen Mary University of London, U.K., in 2012.

In this paper, we consider the two-dimensional optimization to lexicographically minimize the on-grid energy consumption in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). All the base stations (BSs) therein are envisioned to be powered by both power grid and renewable energy sources, and the harvested energy can be stored in rechargeable batteries. The lexicographic minimization of on-grid energy consumption involves the optimization in both the space and time dimensions, due to the temporal and spatial dynamics of mobile traffic and green energy generation. The reasonable assumption of time scale separation allows us to decompose the problem into two sub-optimization problems without loss of optimality of the original optimization problem. We first formulate the user association optimization in space dimension via convex optimization to minimize total energy consumption through distributing the traffic across different BSs appropriately in a certain time slot. We then optimize the green energy allocation across different time slots for an individual BS to lexicographically minimize the on-grid energy consumption. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a low complexity optimal offline algorithm with infinite battery capacity by assuming non-causal green energy and traffic information. The proposed optimal offline algorithm serves as performance upper bound for evaluating practical online algorithms. We further develop some heuristic online algorithms with finite battery capacity which require only causal green energy and traffic information. The performance of the proposed optimal offline and online algorithms is evaluated by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2470659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07214221.pdf","startPage":"4111","endPage":"4124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2470659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Optimization on User Association and Green Energy Allocation for HetNets With Hybrid Energy Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214221/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Optimization on User Association and Green Energy Allocation for HetNets With Hybrid Energy Sources","volume":"63","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676722","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214221/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ESRC U.K.","grantNumber":"ES/M008509/1"},{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61461029"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4144079"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014ZD03-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Optimization on User Association and Green Energy Allocation for HetNets With Hybrid Energy Sources","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liu-2470659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147752S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7214221","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214226,"authors":[{"name":"Shunqiao Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7327073/7214226/7214226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shunqiao Sun (S'11) received the B.E. degree from Southern Yangtze University, Wuxi, China, in 2004, and the M.S. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2011, both in electrical engineering.

In MIMO-MC radars, the subsampled target returns are forwarded by the receive antennas to a fusion center, partially filling a matrix, referred to as the data matrix. The data matrix is first completed via MC techniques and then used to estimate the target parameters via standard array processing methods. This paper studies the applicability of MC theory on the data matrix arising in colocated MIMO radars using uniform linear arrays. It is shown that the data matrix coherence, and consequently the performance of MC, is directly related to the transmit waveforms. Among orthogonal waveforms, the optimum choices are those for which, any snapshot across the transmit array has a flat spectrum. The problem of waveform design is formulated as an optimization problem on the complex Stiefel manifold, and is solved via the modified steepest descent method, or the modified Newton algorithm with nonmonotone line search. Although the optimal waveforms are designed for the case of targets falling in the same range bin, sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the performance degradation when those waveforms are used in scenarios in which the targets fall in different range bins.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform Design for MIMO Radars With Matrix Completion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2469641","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07214226.pdf","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2469641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Waveform Design for MIMO Radars With Matrix Completion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7214226/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676869","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000148","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408437"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform Design for MIMO Radars With Matrix Completion","sourcePdf":"jstsp-petropulu-2469641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092861S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7214226","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214237,"authors":[{"name":"Reuben S.

Here we use a computational method based on a meshed transport network to investigate a cell system model's response to a train of identical, evenly spaced electric field pulses. We obtain an unexpected result: the number of membrane pores decreases during the application of twenty 1.0 kV/cm, 100 \u03bcs pulses, delivered at 1 Hz. This pulse train initially creates 13,000 membrane pores, but pore number decreases by a factor of 15 to about 830 pores throughout subsequent pulses. We conclude that pore number can greatly diminish during a train of identical pulses, with direct consequences for the transport of solutes across an electroporated membrane. Although application of additional pulses is generally intended to increase the effects of EP, we show that these pulses do not significantly enhance calcium delivery into the cell. Instead, calcium delivery can be significantly increased by varying inter-pulse intervals. We show that inserting a 300-s interruption midway in a widely used eight-pulse train (a protocol for electrosensitization) yields a ~twofold delivery increase. Overall, our modeling shows support for electrosensitization, in which multiple pulse protocols that maximize pore number over time can yield significant increase of transport of calcium compared to standard pulse trains.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2466234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2466234","startPage":"571","endPage":"580","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7412788/07214237.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7412788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling a Conventional Electroporation Pulse Train: Decreased Pore Number, Cumulative Calcium Transport and an Example of Electrosensitization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Modeling a Conventional Electroporation Pulse Train: Decreased Pore Number, Cumulative Calcium Transport and an Example of Electrosensitization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214237/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15802410","pubMedId":"26302502","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214237/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"GM063857"},{"fundingName":"NSF"},{"fundingName":"HST"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"RO1-GM63857"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Modeling a Conventional Electroporation Pulse Train: Decreased Pore Number, Cumulative Calcium Transport and an Example of Electrosensitization","sourcePdf":"tbme-gowrishankar-2466234-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102565S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7412788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7412788","articleId":"7214237","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7214242,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Garcia-Rodriguez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7214242/garci-2470656-small.gif","p":["\n\nAdrian Garcia-Rodriguez (S'13) received the M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, in 2012.

In this paper, we propose a method of enhancing the MED in the received SSK constellation and improving both the attainable performance and the power efficiency by means of symbol scaling at the transmitter. To this aim, we formulate a pair of optimization problems, one for maximizing the MED subject to a specific transmit power constraint and one for minimizing the transmit power subject to a MED threshold. As these problems are NP-hard, we re-formulate their optimization using semidefinite relaxations, which results in convex problem formulations that can be efficiently solved using standard approaches. Moreover, we design pre-scaling techniques for imperfect channel state information at the transmitter, where the existing approaches are inapplicable. Our results show that the proposed schemes substantially improve the power efficiency of SSK systems with respect to state-of-the-art techniques by offering an improved performance for specific transmit power requirements or, equivalently, a transmit power reduction for a given MED threshold.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2470656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07214242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2470656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","startPage":"4231","endPage":"4243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-Scaling Optimization for Space Shift Keying Based on Semidefinite Relaxation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pre-Scaling Optimization for Space Shift Keying Based on Semidefinite Relaxation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676755","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7214242/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering, UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) project"},{"fundingName":"India-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC)"},{"fundingName":"EU's Concerto project"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council's Advanced Fellow Grant"},{"fundingName":"Royal Society's Wolfson Research Merit Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Pre-Scaling Optimization for Space Shift Keying Based on Semidefinite Relaxation","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-2470656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098766S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7214242","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214244,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Genovesi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Genovesi","id":"37301022900"},{"name":"Filippo Costa","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Costa","id":"37401434100"},{"name":"Agostino Monorchio","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Agostino","lastName":"Monorchio","id":"37277494100"},{"name":"Giuliano Manara","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuliano","lastName":"Manara","id":"37277485200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7214244","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":946},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A novel encoding paradigm for chipless radio frequency identification (RFID) tags based on phase quantization is presented.

Typically, a reverse engineering approach is employed; this strategy is effective in reproducing possible fitting models of GRNs. To use this strategy, however, two daunting tasks must be undertaken: one task is to optimize the accuracy of inferred network behaviors; and the other task is to designate valid biological topologies for target networks. Although existing studies have addressed these two tasks for years, few of the studies can satisfy both of the requirements simultaneously. To address these difficulties, we propose an integrative modeling framework that combines knowledge-based and data-driven input sources to construct biological topologies with their corresponding network behaviors. To validate the proposed approach, a real dataset collected from the cell cycle of the yeast S. cerevisiae is used. The results show that the proposed framework can successfully infer solutions that meet the requirements of both the network behaviors and biological structures.

The proposed method uses the feature points of a radar signal to estimate the HR efficiently and accurately. Fourier- and periodicity-based methods are inappropriate for estimation of instantaneous HRs in real time because heartbeat waveforms are highly variable, even within the beat-to-beat interval. We define six radar waveform features that enable correlation processing to be performed quickly and accurately. In addition, we propose a feature topology signal that is generated from a feature sequence without using amplitude information. This feature topology signal is used to find unreliable feature points, and thus, to suppress inaccurate HR estimates. Measurements were taken using UWB radar, while simultaneously performing electrocardiography measurements in an experiment that was conducted on nine participants. The proposed method achieved an average root-mean-square error in the interbeat interval of 7.17 ms for the nine participants. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. The significance of this study for biomedical research is that the proposed method will be useful in the realization of a remote vital signs monitoring system that enables accurate estimation of HR variability, which has been used in various clinical settings for the treatment of conditions such as diabetes and arterial hypertension.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2470077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7435363/07214253.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2470077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7435363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature-Based Correlation and Topological Similarity for Interbeat Interval Estimation Using Ultrawideband Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214253/","displayDocTitle":"Feature-Based Correlation and Topological Similarity for Interbeat Interval Estimation Using Ultrawideband Radar","volume":"63","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15869901","pubMedId":"26302507","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214253/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SPIRITS"},{"fundingName":"Center of Innovation Program"},{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"25249057 and 15K18077"},{"fundingName":"The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Feature-Based Correlation and Topological Similarity for Interbeat Interval Estimation Using Ultrawideband Radar","sourcePdf":"tbme-sakamoto-2470077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087375S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7435363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7435363","articleId":"7214253","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7214254,"authors":[{"name":"Troy A.

An example application is a low-visibility landing radar as described by Longstaff (\u201cMIMO radar developments at Teledyne Australia,\u201d Proc. Int. Conf. Radar, 2013). We propose an extension to the common tangent algorithm (COTA), which has been developed by the echo location community for localizing planes with single input multiple output (SIMO) audio systems. The method adopted for this paper is to generalize COTA for the multiple transmitters of the MIMO radar case. Generalizing the COTA equations generates a Non-Convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (NC-QCQP). We show that by first replacing the quadratic constraints by linear approximations we can solve the NC-QCQP problem by iteratively solving a series of quadratic programming problems. This method demonstrates both global convergence and convergence to the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). We then extend this approach to additionally linearize the quadratic objective function, which in turn reduces the iterate to a simple pseudoinverse. This method retains the global convergence properties of the previous method, but does not quite converge to the CRLB. We also investigate two methods which operate directly on the unconstrained cost function, the first a Newton-Raphson based method and the second a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based approach to solving the optimization problem. The SVD method exhibits approximately quadratic convergence and reaches the CRLB. However, it is only locally convergent. The Newton-Raphson method also achieves the CRLB. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate the validity of the techniques presented and show a comparison to the CRLB for the plane localization problem. Finally, we discuss a preprocessing technique that can be used to improve the estimation accuracy. We conclude by demonstrating the proposed algorithms on data collected from the low visibility landing aid radar (Longstaff , 2013) developed at Teledyne Defence Australia.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plane Localization for MIMO Radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2470647","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07214254.pdf","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2470647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Plane Localization for MIMO Radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7214254/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676854","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plane Localization for MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"jstsp-kilpatrick-2470647-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075595S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7214254","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214263,"authors":[{"name":"Maoguo Gong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, International Research Center for Intelligent Perception and Computation, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7312390/7214263/gong-2461653-small.gif","p":["\n\nMaoguo Gong (M'07\u2013SM'14) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Xidian University, Xian, China, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.","He has been a Teacher with Xidian University since 2006, where he was promoted to Associate Professor and Full Professor in 2008 and 2010, respectively, both with exceptive admission.

Many valid criteria have been proposed for band selection, and these criteria model band selection as a single-objective optimization problem. In this paper, a novel multiobjective model is first built for band selection. In this model, two objective functions with a conflicting relationship are designed. One objective function is set as information entropy to represent the information contained in the selected band subsets, and the other one is set as the number of selected bands. Then, based on this model, a new unsupervised band selection method called multiobjective optimization band selection (MOBS) is proposed. In the MOBS method, these two objective functions are optimized simultaneously by a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to find the best tradeoff solutions. The proposed method shows two unique characters. It can obtain a series of band subsets with different numbers of bands in a single run to offer more options for decision makers. Moreover, these band subsets with different numbers of bands can communicate with each other and have a coevolutionary relationship, which means that they can be optimized in a cooperative way. Since it is unsupervised, the proposed algorithm is compared with some related and recent unsupervised methods for hyperspectral image band selection to evaluate the quality of the obtained band subsets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a set of band subsets with different numbers of bands in a single run and that these band subsets have a stable good performance on classification for different data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15568351","htmlLink":"/document/7214263/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Band Selection Based on Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization for Hyperspectral Images","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273317, 61422209 and 61172143"},{"fundingName":"National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals of China"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20130203110011"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"K5051202053"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Band Selection Based on Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization for Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-gong-2461653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122565S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7312390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7312390","articleId":"7214263","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214266,"authors":[{"name":"Agust\u00edn C.

This is specially true in the case of distance education, where no physical interactions between lecturers and students take place, so virtual or remote laboratories must be used. UNED has developed a system to create and manage virtual remote laboratories, aimed at improving the way how practical exercises are conducted. This system is based on cloud computing and virtualization concepts. These Virtual Remote Laboratories (VRLabs) combine features of traditional virtual and remote laboratories but with clear differences over them, among others, VRLabs do not necessarily access real physical devices but are not based on simulations either. Each student is provided with a virtual remote laboratory based on virtualization that he/she will access through the Internet and will use to implement his/her practical assignments. We present details on how these laboratories are implemented for a subject in a post-degree program in our University. Furthermore, we also present an evaluation of the system used on such subject aiming at assessing the quality of the system regarding three different concepts, namely perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived interaction. This evaluation is twofold, first, we have conducted a survey over the students of the subject, and second, we have performed another survey over the teaching team of the subject, both have been performed for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 academic years.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/4620076/7498591/07214266.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2015.2470683","doi":"10.1109/TLT.2015.2470683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7498591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VirTUal remoTe labORatories Management System (TUTORES): Using Cloud Computing to Acquire University Practical Skills","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"VirTUal remoTe labORatories Management System (TUTORES): Using Cloud Computing to Acquire University Practical Skills","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214266/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214266/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2016","accessionNumber":"16105119","volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union project MUREE","grantNumber":"530332-TEMPUS-1-2012-1-JO-TEMPUS-JPCR"},{"fundingName":"Local Project","grantNumber":"2014-027-UNED-PROY"},{"fundingName":"National University for Distance Education of Spain (UNED)"},{"fundingName":"UNED"},{"fundingName":"Banco Santander research project","grantNumber":"2014I/PPRO/031"},{"fundingName":"E-Madrid Network of Excellence","grantNumber":"S2013-ICE2715"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VirTUal remoTe labORatories Management System (TUTORES): Using Cloud Computing to Acquire University Practical Skills","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"tlt-caminero-2470683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091219S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"7498591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7498591","articleId":"7214266","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214268,"authors":[{"name":"Yuning Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stadius Centre for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7543555/7214268/yang-2465178-small.gif","p":["Yuning Yang was born in China in 1984.

Tensor recovery aims at reconstructing a low-rank tensor from some linear measurements, which finds applications in image processing, pattern recognition, multitask learning, and so on. In real-world applications, data might be contaminated by sparse gross errors. However, the existing approaches may not be very robust to outliers. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes approaches based on the regularized redescending M-estimators, which have been introduced in robust statistics. The robustness of the proposed approaches is achieved by the regularized redescending M-estimators. However, the nonconvexity also leads to a computational difficulty. To handle this problem, we develop algorithms based on proximal and linearized block coordinate descent methods. By explicitly deriving the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the data-fitting risk, the descent property of the algorithms is present. Moreover, we verify that the objective functions of the proposed approaches satisfy the Kurdyka-\u0141ojasiewicz property, which establishes the global convergence of the algorithms. The numerical experiments on synthetic data as well as real data verify that our approaches are robust in the presence of outliers and still effective in the absence of outliers.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2465178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7543555/07214268.pdf","startPage":"1933","endPage":"1946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7543555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2465178","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Low-Rank Tensor Recovery With Regularized Redescending M-Estimator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust Low-Rank Tensor Recovery With Regularized Redescending M-Estimator","volume":"27","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"16231702","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","pubMedId":"26302521","htmlLink":"/document/7214268/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council under the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"FP7/2007-2013 and ERC AdG A-DATADRIVE-B (290923)"},{"fundingName":"Research Council KUL","grantNumber":"GOA/10/09 MaNet, CoE PFV/10/002 (OPTEC) and BIL12/11T"},{"fundingName":"PhD/Postdoc"},{"fundingName":"Flemish Government: FWO: PhD/Postdoc","grantNumber":"Project G.0377.12 (structured systems) and Project G.088114N (tensor-based data similarity)"},{"fundingName":"IWT: PhD/Postdoc","grantNumber":"Project SBO POM (100031)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004003","fundingName":"iMinds Medical Information Technologies","grantNumber":"SBO 2014"},{"fundingName":"Belgian Federal Science Policy Office","grantNumber":"IUAP P7/19 (dynamical systems, control and optimization, 2012\u20132017)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Low-Rank Tensor Recovery With Regularized Redescending M-Estimator","sourcePdf":"tnnls-yang-2465178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1827S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7543555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7543555","articleId":"7214268","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214280,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Eriksson","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7484375/7214280/eriks-2465390-small.gif","p":["Emil Eriksson (S'13) received the MSc degree in engineering\n physics from Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, in 2014.

Visual analysis requires the detection and extraction of visual features from the images, and thus the time to complete the analysis depends on the number and on the spatial distribution of the features, both of which are unknown before performing the detection. In this paper, we formulate the minimization of the time needed to complete the distributed visual analysis for a video sequence subject to a mean average precision requirement as a stochastic optimization problem. We propose a solution based on two composite predictors that reconstruct randomly missing data, on quantile-based linear approximation of feature distribution and on time series analysis methods. The composite predictors allow us to compute an approximate optimal solution through linear programming. We use two surveillance video traces to evaluate the proposed algorithms, and show that prediction is essential for minimizing the completion time, even if the wireless channel conditions vary and introduce significant randomness. The results show that the last value predictor together with regular quantile-based distribution approximation provide a low complexity solution with very good performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7484375/07214280.pdf","startPage":"1743","endPage":"1756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2465390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2465390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Distributed Visual Analysis for Video in Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Visualization","Cameras","Data mining","Optimal scheduling","Video sequences","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","linear programming","stochastic programming","time series","video signal processing","video surveillance","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive distributed visual analysis","wireless sensor networks","visual sensor network","sensor nodes","visual feature extraction","visual feature detection","spatial distribution","video sequence subject","mean average precision requirement","stochastic optimization problem","quantile-based linear approximation","feature distribution method","time series analysis method","linear programming","surveillance video trace","completion time minimization","wireless channel condition","quantile-based distribution approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image analysis","wireless sensor networks","scheduling","distributed computation"]},{"kwd":["Image analysis","wireless sensor networks","scheduling","distributed computation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Distributed Visual Analysis for Video in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7214280/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16070180","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Future and Emerging Technologies (FET)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"296676"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Distributed Visual Analysis for Video in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-eriksson-2465390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09784S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7484375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7484375","articleId":"7214280","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214283,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Yin","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7511816/7214283/yin-2457894-small.gif","p":["Shen Yin (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.E. degree in automation from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree in control and information systems, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from the University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany, in 2007 and 2011.","His current research interests include model-based and data-driven fault-diagnosis, fault-tolerant control, and big data focused on industrial electronics applications."]},"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Yin","id":"37068496800"},{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7511816/7214283/shi-2457894-small.gif","p":["Peng Shi (M\u201995\u2013SM\u201998\u2013F\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1982;

To overcome the inherent limitations of fix-gain feedback control and improve the servo performance, a performance-oriented variable-gain control strategy with accelerated iterative parameter tuning is proposed for an ultra-precision wafer stage. The variable-gain controller comprises a fix-gain proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and add-on variable-gain elements, which are the focus of this paper. Specifically, the add-on variable-gain elements are significantly designed based on the main tracking error sources and error frequency of different reference trajectory phases. A weighted two-norm regarding the performance indexes of wafer stages, i.e., moving average (MA) and moving standard deviation (MSD) of the tracking error, is synthesized as the objective function, and the data-driven Levenberg-Marquardt-based iterative parameter tuning scheme is employed to find the optimal parameter values of the proposed variable-gain controller. Furthermore, to improve the convergence rate, a multiparameter accelerated iterative method is developed based on Aitken's method. Finally, the proposed variable-gain control strategy is implemented on an ultra-precision wafer stage developed in our laboratory. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that the strategy performs best and achieves excellent improvement on both MA and MSD. During the scanning phase, MA and MSD are less than 1.02 and 2.35 nm, respectively. The proposed variable-gain control strategy is also suitable for other industrial applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2470223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7287829/07214289.pdf","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1189","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2470223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Variable-Gain Control Strategy for an Ultra-Precision Wafer Stage With Accelerated Iterative Parameter Tuning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Variable-Gain Control Strategy for an Ultra-Precision Wafer Stage With Accelerated Iterative Parameter Tuning","volume":"11","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7214289/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15489134","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51105226"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Variable-Gain Control Strategy for an Ultra-Precision Wafer Stage With Accelerated Iterative Parameter Tuning","sourcePdf":"tii-hu-2470223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16332S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7287829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7287829","articleId":"7214289","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7214291,"authors":[{"name":"Amro M.

While these technological advances have demonstrated robust operation and been qualitatively successful in achieving reconfigurability, their ultimate industrial adoption remains limited. Among the barriers to adoption has been the relative absence of formal and quantitative multiagent system design methodologies based on reconfigurability measurement. Hence, it is not clear that the degree to which these designs have achieved their intended level of reconfigurability, which systems are indeed quantitatively more reconfigurable, and how these designs may overcome their design limitations to achieve greater reconfigurability in subsequent design iterations. To our knowledge, this paper is the first multiagent system reference architecture for reconfigurable manufacturing systems driven by a quantitative and formal design approach. It is rooted in an established engineering design methodology called axiomatic design for large flexible engineering systems and draws upon design principles distilled from prior works on reconfigurability measurement. The resulting architecture is written in terms of the mathematical description used in reconfigurability measurement, which straightforwardly allows instantiation for system-specific application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Axiomatic Design of a Multiagent Reconfigurable Mechatronic System Architecture","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2470528","startPage":"1142","endPage":"1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2470528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7287829/07214291.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"An Axiomatic Design of a Multiagent Reconfigurable Mechatronic System Architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7214291/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15489138","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Axiomatic Design of a Multiagent Reconfigurable Mechatronic System Architecture","sourcePdf":"tii-ribeiroge-2470528-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090585S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7287829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7287829","articleId":"7214291","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214297,"authors":[{"name":"Weimin Duan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7214297/duan-2470646-small.gif","p":["Weimin Duan was born in China in 1987.

The proposed bidirectional soft-decision feedback equalizer (Bi-SDFE) uses a time reversed SDFE in conjunction with a normal SDFE to harvest time-reverse diversity and mitigate error propagation. A simple and effective linear combining scheme is derived for combining the extrinsic information on the two SDFEs for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multilevel modulation. The bit-error-rate (BER) simulation results show that the proposed Bi-SDFE exhibits a lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) threshold than the original SDFE and outperforms the well-known exact turbo minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear equalizers (LEs) at medium-to-high SNRs. Moreover, both extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and BER simulation results show that the Bi-SDFE achieves better performance than the original SDFE, whereas the Bi-SDFE uses only half the number of iterations of the SDFE. Therefore, the total computational complexity of the Bi-SDFE is similar to that of the original SDFE, which is a linear function of the channel length, MIMO size, and modulation constellation size. The performance gain of the proposed Bi-SDFE is also verified through an underwater acoustic (UWA) communication experiment with tough channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2470646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07214297.pdf","startPage":"4925","endPage":"4936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2470646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional Soft-Decision Feedback Turbo Equalization for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214297/","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional Soft-Decision Feedback Turbo Equalization for MIMO Systems","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141170","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214297/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 0846486 and ECCS 1408316"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional Soft-Decision Feedback Turbo Equalization for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-duan-2470646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08721S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7214297","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214298,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7214298/ren-2471085-small.gif","p":["\n\nXiang Ren received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Wuhan \nUniversity, Wuhan, China, in 2011.

However, with increasing train mobility, the resulting large Doppler shift introduces intercarrier interference (ICI) in OFDM systems and greatly degrades channel estimation accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary and important to investigate reliable channel estimation and ICI mitigation methods in high-mobility environments. In this paper, we consider a typical HST communication system and show that the ICI caused by large Doppler shifts can be mitigated by exploiting the train position information and the sparsity of the basis expansion model (BEM)-based channel model. Then, we show that for the complex-exponential BEM (CE-BEM)-based channel model, the ICI can be completely eliminated to get the ICI-free pilots at each receive antenna. After that, we propose a new pilot pattern design algorithm to reduce system coherence to improve the compressed-sensing-based channel estimation accuracy. The proposed optimal pilot pattern is independent of the number of receive antennas, the Doppler shifts, train position, or train speed. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in high-mobility environments. The results also show that the proposed scheme is robust to the speed of the moving train.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2471085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07214298.pdf","startPage":"6204","endPage":"6216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2471085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Channel Estimation With Position-Based ICI Elimination for High-Mobility SIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214298/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Channel Estimation With Position-Based ICI Elimination for High-Mobility SIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210023","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214298/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973 Project","grantNumber":"2012CB316106"},{"fundingName":"Natural National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322102 and 61221001"},{"fundingName":"Southeast University National Key Laboratory on Mobile Communications","grantNumber":"2013D11"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Channel Estimation With Position-Based ICI Elimination for High-Mobility SIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-tao-2471085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097285S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7214298","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7214300,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7214300/kim-small.gif","p":["Jinho Kim (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from\n Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea, in 2013 and 2015, respectively, where he is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree.","He is an Assistant Researcher at the Wind Energy Grid-Adaptive Technologies Research Center, Jeonju, supported by\n the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, Korea.

This paper proposes an adaptive reactive power to the voltage (Q-V) scheme for the voltage control of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based WPP. In the proposed scheme, the WPP controller uses a voltage control mode and sends a voltage error signal to each DFIG. The DFIG controller also employs a voltage control mode utilizing the adaptive Q-V characteristics depending on the reactive power capability such that a DFIG with a larger reactive power capability will inject more reactive power to ensure fast voltage recovery. Test results indicate that the proposed scheme can recover the voltage within a short time, even for a grid fault with a small short-circuit ratio, by making use of the available reactive power of a WPP and differentiating the reactive power injection in proportion to the reactive power capability. This will, therefore, help to reduce the additional reactive power and ensure fast voltage recovery.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2464715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2464715","startPage":"3586","endPage":"3599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7352399/07214300.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive <i>Q\u2013V</i> Scheme for the Voltage Control of a DFIG-Based Wind Power Plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive <i>Q\u2013V</i> Scheme for the Voltage Control of a DFIG-Based Wind Power Plant","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214300/","accessionNumber":"15677465","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214300/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2010-0028509"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-AC36-08-GO28308"},{"fundingName":"NREL"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive <italic>Q\u2013V</italic> Scheme for the Voltage Control of a DFIG-Based Wind Power Plant","sourcePdf":"tpel-kim-2464715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102891S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7214300","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7214301,"authors":[{"name":"Nilson Henao","affiliation":["Hydrogen Research Institute and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7857818/7214301/henao-2462719-small.gif","p":["Nilson Henao (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from the Universidad de los Llanos, Villavicencio, Colombia, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, QC, Canada, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","His current research interests include machine learning techniques for nonintrusive appliance load monitoring to disaggregate and track device electrical signatures."]},"firstName":"Nilson","lastName":"Henao","id":"38513107900"},{"name":"Kodjo Agbossou","affiliation":["Hydrogen Research Institute and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7857818/7214301/agbos-2462719-small.gif","p":["Kodjo Agbossou (M\u201998\u2013SM\u201901) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic measurements from the Universit\u00e9 de Nancy I, Nancy, France, in 1987, 1989, and 1992, respectively.","He was a Postdoctoral Researcher from 1993 to 1994 and a Lecturer from 1997 to 1998 with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (UQTR), Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, QC, Canada.

To this end, a new multipoint ranging algorithm is proposed, which is obtained by adapting superresolution techniques to the ranging problem, using for the sake of illustration the specific cases of time of arrival (ToA) and phase-difference of arrival (PDoA), unified under the same mathematical framework. The resulting nonparametric algorithm handles multipoint ranging in an efficient manner by employing an orthogonalized nonuniform sampling scheme optimized via Golomb rulers. Since the approach requires the design of mutually orthogonal sets of Golomb rulers with equivalent properties-a problem that founds no solution in current literature-a new genetic algorithm to accomplish this task is presented, which is also found to outperform the best known alternative when used to generate a single ruler. Finally, a Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis of the overall optimized multipoint ranging solution is performed, which together with a comparison against simulation results validates the proposed techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7214304/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697415","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Superresolution Multipoint Ranging With Optimized Sampling via Orthogonally Designed Golomb Rulers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference"},{"fundingName":"IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superresolution Multipoint Ranging With Optimized Sampling via Orthogonally Designed Golomb Rulers","sourcePdf":"twc-abreu-2470687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176206S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7214304","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7214305,"authors":[{"name":"Shivam Verma","affiliation":["Microelectronics and VLSI Group, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7214305/verma-2454859-small.gif","p":["Shivam Verma received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Shri Vaishnav Institute of Technology and Science at Indore, Indore, India, in 2010, and the M.Tech. degree in microelectronics from IIT Varanasi, Varanasi, India, in 2012.

Hence, the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with an optimized structure and magnetic properties are being explored to reduce the switching current. However, the switching current reduction in the MTJs generally lowers the data-retention capability. Hence, a different approach to reduce power dissipation using a novel select device should be considered. This paper, therefore, explores the STT MRAM with vertical silicon nanowire gate all around (GAA) high-k select device for superior performance. The MTJ is stacked above the vertical GAA device, so that both occupy the same footprint area to achieve high array density. Furthermore, enhancement of current drive using high-k gate dielectric and its impact on the STT MRAMs are analyzed at different feature sizes.

The error correction codes (ECCs) are routinely used to ensure that those errors do not cause data corruption. However, ECCs introduce overheads both in terms of memory bits and decoding time that limit speed. In particular, this is an issue for applications that require strong error correction capabilities. A number of recent works have proposed advanced ECCs, such as orthogonal Latin squares or difference set codes that can be decoded with relatively low delay. The price paid for the low decoding time is that in most cases, the codes are not optimal in terms of memory overhead and require more parity check bits. On the other hand, codes like the (24,12) Golay code that minimize the number of parity check bits have a more complex decoding. A compromise solution has been recently explored for Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes. The idea is to implement a fast parallel decoder to correct the most common error patterns (single and double adjacent) and use a slower serial decoder for the rest of the patterns. In this brief, it is shown that the same scheme can be efficiently implemented for the (24,12) Golay code. In this case, the properties of the Golay code can be exploited to implement a parallel decoder that corrects single- and double-adjacent errors that is faster and simpler than a single-error correction decoder. The evaluation results using a 65-nm library show significant reductions in area, power, and delay compared with the traditional decoder that can correct single and double-adjacent errors. In addition, the proposed decoder is also able to correct some triple-adjacent errors, thus covering the most common error patterns.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7436835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7436835/07214307.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2465846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2465846","startPage":"1603","endPage":"1606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Single and Double-Adjacent Error Correcting Parallel Decoder for the (24,12) Extended Golay Code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214307/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Single and Double-Adjacent Error Correcting Parallel Decoder for the (24,12) Extended Golay Code","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214307/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15874322","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Single and Double-Adjacent Error Correcting Parallel Decoder for the (24,12) Extended Golay Code","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-reviriego-2465846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059241S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7436835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7436835","articleId":"7214307","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7214312,"authors":[{"name":"Jinting Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7214312/wang-2470115-small.gif","p":["\n\nJinting Wang received the B.Sc. degree from Hebei Normal University, \nShijiazhuang, China, in 1994; the M.Sc. degree from Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 1997; and the \nPh.D. degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2000.","He is a Professor and the Deputy Director with the Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University.

If the SU finds the primary user (PU) band unavailable, it must decide with a probability estimate to either enter a retrial group or give up its service and leave the system. SUs in the retrial group independently retry after an exponentially distributed random time until they successfully access the spectrum. When the PU arrives, the SU's service on the band is interrupted. This interrupted SU is then assumed to occupy the PU band immediately when the PU completes its service. First, the noncooperative joining behavior of SUs that choose to maximize their benefit in a selfish distributed manner is investigated, and an inefficient Nash equilibrium is derived. Second, from the perspective of the social planner, the socially optimal joining strategy when SUs cooperate with each other is studied, and the corresponding Nash equilibrium is exactly derived. Finally, the result that an individually optimal strategy, in general, does not yield the socially optimal strategy is theoretically verified. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between the individually and socially optimal strategies, a novel strategy of imposing an admission fee on SUs to join the retrial group is proposed and investigated with the derivation of an optimal value for the admission fee. The numerical analysis indicates that the proposed admission fee as an equilibrium strategy and the socially optimal strategy of SUs improve efficiency in the utilization of the CR system.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7513343/7214312-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141208","htmlLink":"/document/7214312/","displayDocTitle":"Noncooperative and Cooperative Joining Strategies in Cognitive Radio Networks With Random Access","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11171019, 71571014 and 71390334"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0568"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1137732 and 1241626"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Noncooperative and Cooperative Joining Strategies in Cognitive Radio Networks With Random Access","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2470115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130981S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7214312","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7214313,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715514300"},{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Derong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085493741"},{"name":"Hongliang Li","affiliation":["IBM Research\u2014China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongliang","lastName":"Li","id":"38467278700"},{"name":"Biao Luo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37674956600"},{"name":"Hongwen Ma","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongwen","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085461531"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2216"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2232"}],"articleNumber":"7214313","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1259},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Robust control","Nonlinear systems","Approximation methods","Robustness","Neural networks","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","discrete time systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","robust control","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain system","robust stabilization","discrete-time nonlinear systems","approximate optimal control","robust control","optimal control","discrete-time generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation","successive approximation method","neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)","generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (GHJB) equation","neural networks","optimal control","robust control","successive approximation method","uncertainties"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)","generalized Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman (GHJB) equation","neural networks","optimal control","robust control","successive approximation method","uncertainties"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence paper, the robust stabilization of a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems with uncertainties is investigated by using an approximate optimal control approach.

This paper, composed of two articles Part 1 and Part 2, proposes a unified theory describing electrical and electromechanical properties of an important and wide class of conditioning circuits: those implementing a rectangular charge-voltage cycle. The article Part 1 introduces a basic configuration of conditioning circuit implementing an ideal rectangular QV cycle, and discusses its known practical implementations: the Roundy charge pump with different flyback mechanisms, and configurations based on the Bennet's doubler. In Part 1, the analysis is done in the electrical domain, without accounting for electromechanical coupling, while in Part 2, the full electromechanical system is analyzed. An optimization approach common to all configurations is proposed. A comparison is made between different topologies and operation modes, based on the maximal energy converted in one cycle under similar electrical and mechanical conditions. The last section discusses practical implementation of circuits with smart and adaptive behavior, and presents experimental results obtained with state-of-the art MEMS capacitive KEH devices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2451911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7307240/07214328.pdf","startPage":"2652","endPage":"2663","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2451911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitive Energy Conversion With Circuits Implementing a Rectangular Charge-Voltage Cycle\u2014Part 1: Analysis of the Electrical Domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Capacitive Energy Conversion With Circuits Implementing a Rectangular Charge-Voltage Cycle\u2014Part 1: Analysis of the Electrical Domain","volume":"62","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7214328/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568149","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitive Energy Conversion With Circuits Implementing a Rectangular Charge-Voltage Cycle\u2014Part 1: Analysis of the Electrical Domain","sourcePdf":"tcsi-oriordan-2451911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081028S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7307240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7307240","articleId":"7214328","onlineDate":"20 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":7214350,"authors":[{"name":"Dana Lahat","affiliation":["GIPSA-Lab, UMR CNRS 5216, Saint Martin d'H\u00e8res, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7214335/7214350/lahat-2460697-small.gif","p":["\nDana Lahat received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2013.

We use the term \u201cmodality\u201d for each such acquisition framework. Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, it is rare that a single modality provides complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities reporting on the same system introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. As we argue, many of these questions, or \u201cchallenges,\u201d are common to multiple domains. This paper deals with two key issues: \u201cwhy we need data fusion\u201d and \u201chow we perform it.\u201d The first issue is motivated by numerous examples in science and technology, followed by a mathematical framework that showcases some of the benefits that data fusion provides. In order to address the second issue, \u201cdiversity\u201d is introduced as a key concept, and a number of data-driven solutions based on matrix and tensor decompositions are discussed, emphasizing how they account for diversity across the data sets. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader, regardless of his or her community of origin, with a taste of the vastness of the field, the prospects, and the opportunities that it holds.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2460697","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7214335/07214350.pdf","startPage":"1449","endPage":"1477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7214335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2460697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Data Fusion: An Overview of Methods, Challenges, and Prospects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7214350","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Data Fusion: An Overview of Methods, Challenges, and Prospects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214350/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15383214","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214350/","volume":"103","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Project CHESS","grantNumber":"2012-ERC-AdG-320684)"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"IIS 1017718 and CCF 1117056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Data Fusion: An Overview of Methods, Challenges, and Prospects","sourcePdf":"jproc-lahat-2460697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.247407S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7214335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"329","xplore-issue":"7214335","articleId":"7214350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7214354,"authors":[{"name":"T\u00fclay Adali","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"T\u00fclay","lastName":"Adali","id":"37284803700"},{"name":"Yuri Levin-Schwartz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7214335/7214354/levin-2461601-small.gif","p":["\nYuri Levin-Schwartz received the B.S. degree in physics and the B.A. degree in mathematics from Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA, in 2012.

The previous paper in this special issue discusses the properties and the main issues in the implementation of these two models. In this accompanying paper, we consider the application of these two models to fusion of multimodal medical imaging data-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from a group of healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia performing an auditory oddball task. We show how both models can be used to identify a set of components that report on differences between the two groups, jointly, for all the modalities used in the study. We discuss the importance of algorithm and order selection as well as tradeoffs involved in the selection of one model over another. We note that for the selected data set, especially given the limited number of subjects available for the study, jICA provides a more desirable solution, however the use of an ICA algorithm that uses flexible density matching provides advantages over the most widely used algorithm, Infomax, for the problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7214354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2015","volume":"103","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"15383213","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7214354/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Data Fusion Using Source Separation: Application to Medical Imaging","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF-IIS","grantNumber":"1017718"},{"fundingName":"NSF-CCF","grantNumber":"1117056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"2R01EB000840"},{"fundingName":"NIH COBRE","grantNumber":"P20GM103472"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Data Fusion Using Source Separation: Application to Medical Imaging","sourcePdf":"jproc-adali-2461601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148445S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7214335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7214335","articleId":"7214354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7216611,"authors":[{"name":"Athanassios M.

Results indicate that power-to-gas could play a role in future energy systems with a high imposed share of renewable energy, especially when the renewable energy production profile shows a seasonal trend.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7216744/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7216744/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15384888","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Possible role of power-to-gas in future energy systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Possible role of power-to-gas in future energy systems","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067091S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7169452","isNumber":"7216596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7169452","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7216596","articleId":"7216744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7216840,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Ren Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ilan University, Yilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Ren","lastName":"Chien","id":"37085410113"},{"name":"Yi-Wu Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Wu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085737575"},{"name":"Hen-Wai Tsao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hen-Wai","lastName":"Tsao","id":"37277278800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8745-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7216840","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Bit error rate","Peak to average power ratio","Broadband communication","Estimation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal quality aware impulsive noise mitigation","power line communications","impulsive noise","PLC environment","orthogonal frequency division modulation","broadband PLC systems","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","OFDM signals","signal quality-aware IN mitigation method","false alarm probability","bit error rate","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE P1901","Power-line communication (PLC)","impulsive noise (IN)","kurtosis"]}],"abstract":"Conventional threshold-based method, such as nulling or clipping, is simple and effective for mitigation of impulsive noise (IN) in power-line commnucations (PLC) environment. However, we raise two issues for the threshold-based approach. First, for orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM) broadband PLC systems, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) characteristics of the received OFDM signals increase the difficulty of determining the threshold in a systematic fashion; second, in the cases of absence of IN or low insertion loss, the threshold-based IN mitigation approach may fail. This paper proposes a signal-quality-aware IN mitigation method to address these two issues. By calculating the kurtosis of the received signals, we can determine whether to null the received signals or not. If the values of kurtosis are high enough, a multi-threshold-based nulling approach is applied, which significantly reduces the false alarm probability of IN detection and hence improves the resulting bit error rate (BER) performance. Based on the specification of IEEE P1901, we setup a simulation to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCE-TW.2015.7216840","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Taiwan","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Taiwan","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170113/7216784/07216840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE-TW.2015.7216840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7216784","startPage":"174","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-quality-aware impulsive noise mitigation for OFDM-based power-line communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7216840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal-quality-aware impulsive noise mitigation for OFDM-based power-line communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7216840/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15400898","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7216840/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-quality-aware impulsive noise mitigation for OFDM-based power-line communications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p174chien.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071919S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170113","isNumber":"7216784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170113","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7216784","articleId":"7216840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7216842,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Fu Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Fu","lastName":"Luo","id":"37534437500"},{"name":"Ming-Der Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Der","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37085390461"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8745-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7216842","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Program processors","Delays","Algorithm design and analysis","Memory architecture","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","shared memory systems","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory management scheme","pipelined shared-memory FFT processors","fast Fourier transforms","multipath delay commutator","data relocation scheme","area requirement","power dissipation","generalized memory addressing algorithm","mixed-radix MDC architecture","multibank memory structures","FFT design"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an efficient memory management scheme for pipelined shared-memory architectures of the fast Fourier transform (FFT).

To achieve high frame rate, the plane-wave transmission and post-acquisition beamforming are used.

Therefore, in this paper we proposed a way to improve the beamforming process by using k-space beamforming and angular compounding with coherence factor method. With our new method, high-quality echographic images are obtained without significantly affect the high frame rate capabilities.

The ability for positioning in non-line of sight (NLOS) environments has made cellular network based positioning highly popular. However, the position estimation fine-tuning step in the current cellular network based positioning algorithm is not utilizing the available information completely. Thus, an improved position fine-tuning step is proposed in view of a more accurate final position estimate by harnessing all the available information. Simulation results verify the accuracy improvements associated with the three proposed fine-tuning techniques. Furthermore, the same fine-tuning techniques can also be utilized to fine-tune global positioning system (GPS) based positioning too, to obtain high accuracies without complicated hardware.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Mobile communication","Global Positioning System","Mobile computing","Iterative methods","Signal processing algorithms","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","object tracking","pedestrians"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pedestrian tracking algorithm","NLOS cellular environments","pedestrian position tracking","location based services","cellular networks","position estimation fine-tuning step"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NLOS","Pedestrian tracking","Improved estimate fine-tuning"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSITT.2015.7217095","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies (APSITT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies (APSITT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210373/7217073/07217095.pdf","doi":"10.1109/APSITT.2015.7217095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved pedestrian tracking algorithm for NLOS cellular environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved pedestrian tracking algorithm for NLOS cellular environments","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15417145","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7217095/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved pedestrian tracking algorithm for NLOS cellular environments","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"RS-4-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065592S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210373","isNumber":"7217073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7217073","articleId":"7217095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7217107,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjian Wang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Japan"],"firstName":"Wenjian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085711037"},{"name":"Ye Tian","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Japan"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085764478"},{"name":"Chang-Jun Ahn","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Japan"],"firstName":"Chang-Jun","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37269270800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2298-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7217107","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Synchronization","Estimation","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","estimation theory","fading channels","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time synchronization scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM systems","pseudonoise preamble","PN sequences","symbol timing synchronization inaccuracy","phase offset","intersymbol interference","ISI","interchannel interference","ICI","symbol timing synchronizer","timing offset estimation","error mean","standard deviation","flat-fading channels","frequency-selective fading channels","FSF channels"]}],"abstract":"The symbol timing synchronization inaccuracy can bring about phase offset (FO), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-channel interference (ICI).

Two path-loss models based on weighted centroids and non-negative least squares estimation are presented: one including a floor loss factor, and the other one ignoring the floor losses, and the three signal types are compared in terms of the path-loss parameters, channel fluctuations and positioning accuracy, namely the distance errors and floor detection probabilities. The comparison is done based on real-field measurement data collected from a university building in Tampere, Finland. It is shown that all these three signal types have similar shadowing variances and close path-loss parameter values, and that a path-loss model considering floor losses gives the best floor detection probability, but not necessarily the smallest distance error.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Localization and GNSS

For this purpose we have used Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) which enables autonomous calibration of grid-cell layout (GCL) for better UE positioning as compared to that of the conventional fingerprinting approach. Performance evaluations were carried out using two different training data-sets consisting of Minimization of Drive Testing measurements obtained from a dynamic system simulation in a heterogeneous LTE small cell environment. The robustness of the proposed method has been tested analyzing positioning results from two different areas of interest. Optimization of GCL is performed in two ways: (1) array-wise calibration of the grid-cell units using non-overlapping GCL and (2) creating an overlapping GCL to cover of whole simulation area with different rectangular grid-cell units. Simulation results show that if sufficient amount of training data is available then the proposed method can improve positioning accuracy of 56.74% over the conventional grid-based RF fingerprinting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217160/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15385114","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7217160/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm optimized grid-based RF fingerprint positioning in heterogeneous small cell networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm optimized grid-based RF fingerprint positioning in heterogeneous small cell networks","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"S63Mondal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061661S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172305","isNumber":"7217133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172305","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7217133","articleId":"7217160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7217782,"authors":[{"name":"Lihua Pang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Pang","id":"37396232400"},{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405818200"},{"name":"Fengkui Gong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fengkui","lastName":"Gong","id":"37272503600"},{"name":"Guangliang Ren","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guangliang","lastName":"Ren","id":"37280950700"},{"name":"Anyi Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Anyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085645062"},{"name":"Xiao Liang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37406458900"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085347412"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7217782","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter first presents an incremental amplify-and-forward orthogonal frequency division multiplexing relaying scheme to promote the spectrum efficiency of cooperative transmission. Then, the energy efficiency problem is thoughtfully investigated in order to prolong the lifetime for such battery-operated wireless networks. As will be seen, the original optimization problem incorporating incremental policy, relay selection and power loading is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem that is quite hard to solve even numerically, thereby necessitating our derivation of a suboptimal approach for implementation feasibility. Specifically, by exploiting energy pricing concept as well as max-min energy efficiency criterion, a stepwise energy aware resource allocation algorithm is proposed. Finally, numerical results verify the benefits of our proposals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7294672/07217782.pdf","startPage":"1766","endPage":"1769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2471308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2471308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Aware Resource Allocation for Incremental AF-OFDM Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Optimization","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Pricing","Cooperative systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","energy conservation","integer programming","minimax techniques","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","pricing","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental AF-OFDM relaying scheme","amplify-and-forward orthogonal frequency division multiplexing relaying scheme","cooperative transmission spectrum efficiency","battery-operated wireless network","incremental policy","relay selection","power loading","mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem","optimization problem","energy pricing","max-min energy efficiency criterion","stepwise energy aware resource allocation algorithm"]},{"kwd":["Incremental relaying","amplify-and-forward","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","lifetime optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Aware Resource Allocation for Incremental AF-OFDM Relaying","volume":"19","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7217782/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520401","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015JQ6221, 2015JQ6259 and 2015JM6341"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB140109"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401321 and 61372067"},{"fundingName":"National Hightech R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB340206"},{"fundingName":"Research Culture Funds of Xi'an University of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"201357"},{"fundingName":"Open Project of the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks","grantNumber":"ISN16-01"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Aware Resource Allocation for Incremental AF-OFDM Relaying","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-2471308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092193S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7294672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7294672","articleId":"7217782","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7217785,"authors":[{"name":"Min Sheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7358196/7217785/sheng-2471395-small.gif","p":["\n\nMin Sheng (M'03) received the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in communication \nand information systems from Xidian University, Shaanxi, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

Considering both stochastic traffic arrivals and time-varying channel conditions, we formulate it as a stochastic optimization problem, which optimizes EE subject to the average power, interference-control, and network stability constraints. With the help of fractional programming and the Lyapunov optimization technique, we develop an algorithm, referred to as the TRADEOFF, to solve the problem. To deal with the nonconvex and NP-hard power allocation subproblem in the TRADEOFF, we adopt the prismatic branch and bound algorithm to find its globally optimal solution, where only a linear programming needs to be solved in each iteration. Thus, the TRADEOFF serves as an important benchmark to evaluate performance of other heuristic algorithms and is usually cost-efficient. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the TRADEOFF achieves an EE-delay tradeoff of [O(1/V),O(V)] with V being a control parameter and can strike a flexible balance between them by simply tuning V.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2471395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7358196/07217785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2471395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358196","startPage":"92","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency and Delay Tradeoff in Device-to-Device Communications Underlaying Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency and Delay Tradeoff in Device-to-Device Communications Underlaying Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15663082","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7217785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231008, 61172079, 61201141, 61301176 and 91338114"},{"fundingName":"863 project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Fund in Xidian University","grantNumber":"7214497201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency and Delay Tradeoff in Device-to-Device Communications Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-li-2471395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131286S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7358196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7358196","articleId":"7217785","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7217787,"authors":[{"name":"Valentin Goverdovsky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7352393/7217787/gover-2471183-small.gif","p":["Valentin Goverdovsky received the M.Eng. degree in electronics engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communications from Imperial College London, U.K. He is currently a Rosetrees Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London.

Unlike our initial designs, which utilize custom earpieces and require a costly and time-consuming manufacturing process, we here introduce the generic earpieces to make ear-EEG suitable for immediate and widespread use. Our approach represents a departure from silicone earmoulds to provide a sensor based on a viscoelastic substrate and conductive cloth electrodes, both of which are shown to possess a number of desirable mechanical and electrical properties. Owing to its viscoelastic nature, such an earpiece exhibits good conformance to the shape of the ear canal, thus providing stable electrode-skin interface, while cloth electrodes require only saline solution to establish low impedance contact. The analysis highlights the distinguishing advantages compared with the current state-of-the-art in ear-EEG. We demonstrate that such a device can be readily used for the measurement of various EEG responses.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7352393/07217787.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2471183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2471183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Ear EEG From Viscoelastic Generic Earpieces: Robust and Unobtrusive 24/7 Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Electroencephalography","Ear","Sensors","Irrigation","Substrates","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","biomedical measurement","biomedical transducers","ear","electroencephalography","viscoelasticity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","electrode-skin interface","conductive cloth electrode","silicone earmould","ear canal","brain activity","wearable electroencephalography","viscoelastic generic earpiece","in-ear EEG sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wearable sensors","electroencephalography","materials"]},{"kwd":["Electroencephalography","wearable sensors","biomedical engineering","materials"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"In-Ear EEG From Viscoelastic Generic Earpieces: Robust and Unobtrusive 24/7 Monitoring","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7217787/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15677567","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Ear EEG From Viscoelastic Generic Earpieces: Robust and Unobtrusive 24/7 Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jsen-goverdovsky-2471183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121947S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7352393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7352393","articleId":"7217787","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7217788,"authors":[{"name":"Dongeun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7286895/7217788/lee-2471802-small.gif","p":["Dongeun Lee received the B.S. degree in computer science and engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006 and 2014, respectively.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea.

We propose a new big data archiving scheme that handles the huge volume of sensor data with an optimized lossy coding. Our scheme leverages spatial and temporal correlations inherent in typical sensor data. The spatio-temporal correlations, observed in quality adjustable sensor data, enable us to compress a massive amount of sensor data without compromising distinctive attributes in sensor signals. Sensor data fidelity can also be decreased gradually. In order to maximize storage efficiency, we derive an optimal storage configuration for this data aging scenario. Experiments show outstanding compression ratios of our scheme and the optimality of storage configuration that minimizes system-wide distortion of sensor data under a given storage space.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2471802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07217788.pdf","startPage":"7284","endPage":"7294","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2471802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable and Flexible Repository for Big Sensor Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable and Flexible Repository for Big Sensor Data","volume":"15","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7217788/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15518955","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (MSIP)","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A1002662, NRF-2014M2A8A2074096, NRF-2012R1A1A2044653 and 2011-0000228"},{"fundingName":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) R&D Program [15ZC1400, The Development of a Realistic Surgery Rehearsal System based on Patient Specific Surgical Planning] funded by the Government of Korea."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable and Flexible Repository for Big Sensor Data","sourcePdf":"jsen-choi-2471802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086772S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7217788","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7217791,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7439729/7217791/alfar-2471260-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque (GSM\u201906\u2013M\u201910) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the RWTH Aachen Technical University, Aachen, Germany, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2009.","He was a Research Scientist with Siemens Corporate Research and Technology, Princeton, NJ, USA.

Improvement in technology, cost, and feature size has enabled devices everywhere, to be connected and interactive, as it is called Internet of Things (IoT). The increasing complexity and data, due to the growing number of devices like sensors and actuators, require powerful computing resources, which may be provided by cloud computing. However, scalability has become the potential issue in cloud computing. In this paper, fog computing is introduced as a novel platform for energy management. The scalability, adaptability, and open source software/hardware featured in the proposed platform enable the user to implement the energy management with the customized control-as-services, while minimizing the implementation cost and time-to-market. To demonstrate the energy management-as-a-service over fog computing platform in different domains, two prototypes of home energy management (HEM) and microgrid-level energy management have been implemented and experimented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","volume":"3","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15885563","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7217791/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management-as-a-Service Over Fog Computing Platform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management-as-a-Service Over Fog Computing Platform","sourcePdf":"jiot-vatanparvar-2471260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18601S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7439729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"7439729","articleId":"7217791","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7217795,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Zhu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37073400300"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7217795","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1798},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","MIMO","Uplink","Antennas","Contamination","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","contamination","fading channels","graph colouring","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph coloring based pilot allocation","GC-PA scheme","pilot contamination","multiple-input multiple-output system","multicell massive MIMO systems","base station","BS antennas","intercell interference","ICI","fading channels","interference graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","pilot contamination","graph coloring"]},{"kwd":["Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","pilot contamination","graph coloring","pilot allocation"]}],"abstract":"A massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which utilizes a large number of base station (BS) antennas to serve a set of users, suffers from pilot contamination due to the inter-cell interference (ICI).

The proposed approach develops around the systematic application of advanced machine learning techniques and, in particular, unsupervised deep learning and probabilistic generative models for system-wide learning, modeling, optimization, and data representation. Moreover, in COBANETS, we propose to combine this learning architecture with the emerging network virtualization paradigms, which make it possible to actuate automatic optimization and reconfiguration strategies at the system level, thus fully unleashing the potential of the learning approach. Compared with the past and current research efforts in this area, the technical approach outlined in this paper is deeply interdisciplinary and more comprehensive, calling for the synergic combination

Quantum Secure Direct Communication With Orbital Angular Momentum of Photons","abstract":"Orbital angular momentum (OAM) states of photons span a high-dimensional Hilbert space, and by using it, higher information capacity and enhanced security can be achieved for both classical communication and quantum key distribution. In this work, we propose a feasible basis-independent encoding scheme for OAM states and show its application in high-dimensional quantum secure direct communication, which enables direct transmission of meaningful messages, in addition to random secret key establishing. Imperfections of optical components may reduce the efficiency of the encoding scheme and, thus, the channel capacity. We discuss the optimal input distribution under realistic conditions to achieve maximal mutual information and an alternative solution using a different set of mutually unbiased bases in the case of a prime-dimensional quantum system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","volume":"7","issue":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15413830","externalId":"7600108","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7217801/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Capacity Quantum Secure Direct Communication With Orbital Angular Momentum of Photons","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11404031, 61205117 and 61471050"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014RC0903"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"High-Capacity Quantum Secure Direct Communication With Orbital Angular Momentum of Photons","sourcePdf":"jphot-wang-2465844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073413S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7222813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7222813","articleId":"7217801","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7217803,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael F.

Such information theoretic approaches establish reliable communication and data confidentiality directly at the physical layer of a communication network by taking the properties of the noisy channel into account leading to unconditional security regardless of the computational capabilities of eavesdroppers. The provision of accurate channel state information is a major challenge particularly in wireless communication systems, especially information about the channels to eavesdroppers. In addition, there might be malevolent adversaries who jam or influence the channel of the legitimate users. This paper surveys different models for secure communication under channel uncertainty and adversarial attacks and reviews the corresponding secrecy capacity results, which characterize the maximum rate at which information can be sent to legitimate receivers while being kept perfectly security from eavesdroppers.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2459652","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7270357/07217803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2459652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270357","startPage":"1796","endPage":"1813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communication Under Channel Uncertainty and Adversarial Attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217803","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5/7270357/7217803-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communication Under Channel Uncertainty and Adversarial Attacks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"103","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456799","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7217803/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG)","grantNumber":"WY 151/2-1"},{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG)","grantNumber":"BO 1734/20-1"},{"fundingName":"German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","grantNumber":"01BQ1050 and 16KIS0118"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1435778"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Secure Communication Under Channel Uncertainty and Adversarial Attacks","sourcePdf":"jproc-schaefer-2459652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137079S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7270357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7270357","articleId":"7217803","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7217807,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Han","affiliation":["Chongqing University, State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment & System Security and New Technology, Chongqing, China","Department of Power Electronics, School of Mechatronics Engineering, Chengdu, China","Artificial Intelligence Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7217807/han-small.gif","p":["Yang Han (S\u201908\u2013M\u201910) was born in Chengdu, China.

The performance enhancement of Delay-PLL, Deri-PLL, and CCF-PLL by including a moving average filter into their structure is another goal of this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2466631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7352399/07217807.pdf","startPage":"3932","endPage":"3944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2466631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Orthogonal-Signal-Generators-Based Single-Phase PLL Algorithms\u2014A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217807/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Orthogonal-Signal-Generators-Based Single-Phase PLL Algorithms\u2014A Survey","volume":"31","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15677483","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7217807/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51307015"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment & System Security and New Technology","grantNumber":"2007DA10512713405"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Subject of Sichuan Province Key Laboratory of Power Electronics Energy-Saving Technologies & Equipment","grantNumber":"szjj2015-067"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Subject of Artificial Intelligence Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2015RZJ02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Orthogonal-Signal-Generators-Based Single-Phase PLL Algorithms\u2014A Survey","sourcePdf":"tpel-guerrero-2466631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100391S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7217807","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7217811,"authors":[{"name":"Mario D\u2019Auria","affiliation":["Optical and Semiconductor Devices Group, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7272756/7217811/dauri-2462130-small.gif","p":["Mario D\u2019Auria (S\u201911) received the M.Sc. degree in electronics engineering from the Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy, in 2010.

Then, 3-D printed MPRWGs are investigated in detail. Two very different 3-D printing technologies have been considered: low-cost lower-resolution fused deposition modeling for microwave applications and higher-cost high-resolution stereolithography for millimeter-wave applications. Measurements against traceable standards in MPRWGs were performed by the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory. It was found that the performance of the 3-D printed MPRWGs were comparable with those of standard waveguides. For example, across X-band (8-12 GHz), the dissipative attenuation ranges between 0.2 and 0.6 dB/m, with a worst case return loss of 32 dB; at W-band (75-110 GHz), the dissipative attenuation was 11 dB/m at the band edges, with a worst case return loss of 19 dB. Finally, a high-performance W-band sixth-order inductive iris bandpass filter, having a center frequency of 107.2 GHz and a 6.8-GHz bandwidth, was demonstrated. The measured insertion loss of the complete structure (filter, feed sections, and flanges) was only 0.95 dB at center frequency, giving an unloaded quality factor of 152 - clearly demonstrating the potential of this low-cost manufacturing technology, offering the advantages of lightweight rapid prototyping/manufacturing and relatively very low cost when compared with traditional (micro)machining.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2462130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7272756/07217811.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2462130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Printed Metal-Pipe Rectangular Waveguides","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"3-D Printed Metal-Pipe Rectangular Waveguides","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217811/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15474821","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7217811/","volume":"5","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000634","fundingName":"Innovative Electronics Manufacturing Research Centre through the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Project entitled 3-D Microwave and Millimeter- Wave System-on-Substrate Using Sacrificial Layers for Printed RF MEMS Component","grantNumber":"SP/02/03/10"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"3-D Printed Metal-Pipe Rectangular Waveguides","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-lucyszyn-2462130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132868S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7272756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"7272756","articleId":"7217811","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7217814,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9mi A.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on polar codes that jointly deals with reliability and secrecy. Specifically, we propose secret-key capacity-achieving polar coding schemes for the following models: (i) the degraded binary memoryless source (DBMS) model with rate-unlimited public communication, (ii) the DBMS model with one-way rate-limited public communication, (iii) the 1-to-m broadcast model and (iv) the Markov tree model with uniform marginals. For models (i) and (ii) our coding schemes remain valid for non-degraded sources, although they may not achieve the secret-key capacity. For models (i), (ii) and (iii), our schemes rely on pre-shared secret seed of negligible rate; however, we provide special cases of these models for which no seed is required. Finally, we show an application of our results to secrecy and privacy for biometric systems. We thus provide the first examples of low-complexity secret-key capacity-achieving schemes that are able to handle vector quantization for model (ii), or multiterminal communication for models (iii) and (iv).","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2471179","startPage":"6213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07217814.pdf","endPage":"6237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2471179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217814/","displayDocTitle":"Polar Coding for Secret-Key Generation","volume":"61","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7217814/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15538813","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 1320298"},{"fundingName":"ANR","grantNumber":"13-BS03-0008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar Coding for Secret-Key Generation","sourcePdf":"tit-chou-2471179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178566S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7217814","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7217822,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Ciocchini","affiliation":["Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7272173/7217822/ciocc-2465835-small.gif","p":["Nicola Ciocchini (S\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2015, focusing his research on phase change memory (PCM).","He completed his Ph.D. degree as a Visiting Scholar with the University of Texas at Austin in 2014.

To optimize the energy consumption and reliability of PCM, a thorough understanding of Joule heating as a function of the electrical operation of the device is thus strongly required. This paper presents a comprehensive characterization of thermoelectric (TE) effects in PCM operated at positive and negative voltage polarity. The impact of polarity was studied for all major temperature-dependent properties of the PCM device, namely, melting, crystallization, ion migration, threshold switching, and holding. It was demonstrated that heating is less efficient under negative voltage, compared with positive voltage. It was also shown that the positive and negative voltages needed to induce all above phenomena display a universal correlation. We propose a unified finite-element model for the PCM, which correctly accounts for the observed polarity-dependent heating and the universal voltage characteristics.

Methods: A population of 29 normal weight and 19 overweight subjects was recruited to perform eight common sports activities, while body movement was measured using a triaxial accelerometer placed at the wrist. User- and axis-independent acceleration signal templates were automatically extracted to represent each activity category and recognize activity types. Five different similarity measures between example signals and templates were compared: Euclidean distance, dynamic time warping (DTW), derivative DTW, correlation and an innovative index, and combining distance and correlation metrics (Rce). Template-based activity recognition was compared to statistical-learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, decision tree, logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN) trained using time- and frequency-domain signal features. Each algorithm was tested on data from a holdout group of 15 normal weight and 19 overweight subjects. Results: The Rce index outperformed other template-matching metrics by achieving recognition rate above 80% for the majority of the activities. Template matching showed robust classification accuracy when tested on unseen data and in case of limited training examples. LR and ANN achieved the highest overall recognition accuracy ~85% but showed to be more vulnerable to misclassification error than template matching on overweight subjects' data. Conclusion: Template matching can be used to classify sports activities using the wrist acceleration signal. Significance: Automatically extracted template prototypes from the acceleration signal may be used to enhance accuracy and generalization properties of statistical-learning classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217826/","volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7217826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15869896","pubMedId":"26302509","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"User-Independent Recognition of Sports Activities From a Single Wrist-Worn Accelerometer: A Template-Matching-Based Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"COMMIT-NL"},{"fundingName":"SWELL"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User-Independent Recognition of Sports Activities From a Single Wrist-Worn Accelerometer: A Template-Matching-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tbme-margarito-2471094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101238S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7435363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7435363","articleId":"7217826","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7217836,"authors":[{"name":"Tufan Kumbasar","affiliation":["Control and Automation Engineering Department, Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7480878/7217836/kumba-2471805-small.gif","p":["Tufan Kumbasar (M\u201913) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D.\n degrees in control and automation engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Control and Automation Engineering Department, Faculty of Electrical\n and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University.

However, the design and robust stability analysis of the IT2-FLCs are still challenging problems due to their relatively more complex internal structure. In this paper, we will derive the explicitly fuzzy mapping (FM) of a single-input IT2-FLC (SIT2-FLC) to present design methods and investigate its robustness. The analytical information of the IT2-FM will give the opportunity to provide explanations on the roles of the FOU parameters by taking advantage of the well-developed framework of nonlinear control theory. Comparative theoretical explorations will be presented on the differences between the type-1 (T1) FM and IT2-FM to clearly show the role of the FOU on the robust control system performance. It will be proven that the robust stability of the IT2 fuzzy system is guaranteed with the aids of the well-known Popov-Lyapunov method. Moreover, analytical design methods are presented for SIT2-FLCs to generate commonly employed control curves by only tuning the size of the FOUs without a need of an optimization procedure. It will be theoretically shown that the FOU gives the opportunity to the SIT2-FLC to generate commonly employed nonlinear control curves while also providing a certain degree of robustness which cannot be accomplished by its T1 counterpart. The presented results provide theoretical explanations on the role of the FOU on the performance and robustness of the SIT2-FLC.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2471805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/7480878/07217836.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2471805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7480878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Stability Analysis and Systematic Design of Single-Input Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust Stability Analysis and Systematic Design of Single-Input Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7217836/","accessionNumber":"16035138","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)","grantNumber":"113E206"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Stability Analysis and Systematic Design of Single-Input Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-kumbasar-2471805-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138006S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7480878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7480878","articleId":"7217836","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7217837,"authors":[{"name":"Iluminada Baturone","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla (IMSE-CNM), Universidad de Sevilla and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC), Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7277179/7217837/batur-2471279-small.gif","p":["Iluminada Baturone received the 5-year (Hons.) degree and the Ph.D. (Hons.) degree in physics from the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, in 1991 and 1996, respectively.","She has been with the Microelectronics Institute of Seville (IMSE-CNM), CSIC/University of Seville, since 1990.

The method is based on classifying memory cells after evaluating their start-up values at multiple measurements in a registration phase. The registration can be done without unplugging the device from its application context, and with no need for a complex laboratory setup. The method has been validated experimentally with standard low-power SRAM modules in two different application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) fabricated with the 90-nm TSMC technology. The results show that with a simple registration the length of the identifiers can be reduced by 45%, the worst case bit error probability (which defines the complexity of the error correcting code needed to recover a secret key) can be reduced by 64%, and the worst case minimum entropy value is improved, thus reducing the number of bits that have to be processed to obtain full entropy by 81%. The method can be applied to standard digital designs by controlling the external power supply to the SRAM using software or by incorporating simple circuitry in the design. In the latter case, a module for implementing the method in an ASIC designed in the 90-nm TSMC technology occupies an active area of 42, 025 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2471279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7277179/07217837.pdf","startPage":"2653","endPage":"2668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2471279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Generation of Identifiers, Secret Keys, and Random Numbers From SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217837/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Generation of Identifiers, Secret Keys, and Random Numbers From SRAMs","volume":"10","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7217837/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15484837","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad of the Spanish Government through the Projects RTC-2014-2932-8 and TEC2014-57971-R (cofunded by Uni\u00f3n Europea-Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, FEDER)"},{"fundingName":"V Plan Propio de Investigaci\u00f3n through the University of Seville, Seville, Spain"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Generation of Identifiers, Secret Keys, and Random Numbers From SRAMs","sourcePdf":"tifs-baturone-2471279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103573S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7277179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7277179","articleId":"7217837","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7217841,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Li","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7217841/xuali-2466539-small.gif","p":["Xuan Li received the B.Eng. degree in optical information science and technology from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2012.

In order to mitigate the performance degradation imposed by the intercell-interference (ICI), a user-centric (UC) cluster formation technique employing vectored transmission (VT) is proposed for the VLC down-link system, where multiple users may be simultaneously supported by multiple access points (APs). In contrast to the traditional network-centric (NC) design, the UC-VT cluster formation is dynamically constructed and adjusted, rather than remaining static. Furthermore, we consider the critical issue of multiuser scheduling (MUS) relying on maximizing the \u201csum utility\u201d of this system, which leads to a joint cluster formation and MUS problem. In order to find a practical solution, the original problem is reformulated as a maximum weighted matching (MWM) problem relying on a user-AP distance-based weight and then a low-complexity greedy algorithm is proposed, which offers a suboptimal yet compelling solution operating close to the optimal value found by the potentially excessive-complexity exhaustive search. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed greedy MUS algorithm combined with the UC-VT cluster formation is capable of providing an average user throughput of about 90% of the optimal throughput, which is about three times the throughput provided by the traditional cellular design in some of the scenarios considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217841/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15697394","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7217841/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Users First: User-Centric Cluster Formation for Interference-Mitigation in Visible-Light Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000690","fundingName":"RC-UK"},{"fundingName":"UK-India ATC in Wireless Communications"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s"},{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61201174"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF of Jiangsu","grantNumber":"BK2012325"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Users First: User-Centric Cluster Formation for Interference-Mitigation in Visible-Light Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-hanzo-2466539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162772S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7217841","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7217842,"authors":[{"name":"Junyi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7217842/jiang-2471809-small.gif","p":["\n\nJunyi Jiang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from \nHeilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009 and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in \nwireless communication from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2010, where he is currently working \ntoward the Ph.D. degree with the Wireless Group.","His research interests include indoor visible light communication, free-space optical communication, and iterative \ndetection."]},"firstName":"Junyi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085712987"},{"name":"Peichang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7217842/pzhan-2471809-small.gif","p":["\n\nPeichang Zhang received the B.Eng. degree (with first-class honors) in \nelectronic engineering from the University of Central Lancashire, Lancashire, U.K., in 2009; the M.Sc. degree (with \ndistinction) in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2010; and the Ph.D. \ndegree from the Communications, Signal Processing, and Control Research Group, Department of Electronics and Computer \nScience, University of Southampton.","He is currently holding a lecturing position with the College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, \nShenzhen, China.

In this paper, we propose a suite of solutions, based on lightweight negative bias temperature instability (NBTI)-aware ring oscillators (ROs), for combating die and IC recycling (CDIR) when ICs are used for a very short duration. The proposed solutions are implemented in the 90-nm technology node. The simulation results demonstrate that our newly proposed NBTI-aware multiple pair RO-based CDIRs can detect ICs used only for a few hours.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Sensors","Integrated circuits","Degradation","Recycling","Frequency measurement","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","negative bias temperature instability","oscillators","recycling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost on-chip structure design","integrated circuit protection","electronic component recycling","recycled integrated circuit","recycled IC","aging","lightweight NBTI-aware ring oscillators","negative bias temperature instability","combating die-IC recycling","IC detection","NBTI-aware multiple-pair RO-based CDIR","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combating die and IC recycling (CDIR)","counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs)","negative bias temperature instability (NBTI)-aware","recycling."]},{"kwd":["Combating die and IC recycling (CDIR)","counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs)","negative bias temperature instability (NBTI)-aware","recycling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217843","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2466551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7436835/07217843.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2466551","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7436835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Accurate Low-Cost On-Chip Structures for Protecting Integrated Circuits Against Recycling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Accurate Low-Cost On-Chip Structures for Protecting Integrated Circuits Against Recycling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217843/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7217843/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15874349","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1423282"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005712","fundingName":"Missile Defense Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Accurate Low-Cost On-Chip Structures for Protecting Integrated Circuits Against Recycling","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-guin-2466551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117341S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7436835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7436835","articleId":"7217843","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7217845,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7389461/7217845/7217845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Li received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.","He has been a Research Associate with the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., since 2013.

Some dc circuit breakers (DCCBs), for example, mechanical type, are low cost and have low power loss, but have been considered unsuitable for dc fault protection and isolation in a multiterminal HVDC system due to their long opening times. This paper proposes the use of additional dc passive components and novel converter control combined with mechanical DCCBs to ensure that the healthy dc network can continue to operate without disruption during a dc fault on one dc branch. Two circuit structures, using an additional dc reactor, and a reactor and capacitor combination, connected to the dc-link node in a radial HVDC system, are proposed to ensure that overcurrent risk at the converters connected to the healthy network is minimized before the isolation of the faulty branch by mechanical DCCBs. Active control of dc fault current by dynamically regulating the dc components of the converter arm voltages is proposed to further reduce the fault arm current. Simulation of a radial three-terminal HVDC system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2471089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7389461/07217845.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2471089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Operation of Radial Multiterminal HVDC Systems Under DC Fault","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217845/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Operation of Radial Multiterminal HVDC Systems Under DC Fault","volume":"31","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7217845/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15722258","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K006428/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Operation of Radial Multiterminal HVDC Systems Under DC Fault","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-li-2471089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083327S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7389461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"7389461","articleId":"7217845","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7217851,"authors":[{"name":"Yongle Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongle","lastName":"Wu","id":"37600823400"},{"name":"Lingxiao Jiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingxiao","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37085458734"},{"name":"Yuanan Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"7217851","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":991},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Impedance matching","Power amplifiers","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance convertors","impedance matching","integrated circuit design","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-band matching network","concurrent dual-band power amplifiers","real-to-complex impedance transformation","short-circuited stub","open-circuited stub","real-to-complex matching network","input impedance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual band","impedance matching","power amplifier","real to complex"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7217851","abstract":"A novel dual-band matching network for concurrent dual-band power amplifiers has been proposed and discussed by Fu in January 2014.

The thermal noise is investigated with accurate estimation by deriving closed-form expressions according to the noise equivalent models on different phases. Additionally, the design trade-off between power and noise for two ADC architectures is discussed in detail. On the other hand, the reference noise due to the large switching transient, which significantly degrades the conversion accuracy, is analyzed and verified through behavioral and circuit level simulations of two ADC architectures operating at 500 MS/s for 10-bit resolution. The simulated results show the supremacy of the PI Pipelined-SAR (PS) architecture over the TI-SAR because it exhibits less reference noise sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2452331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2452331","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7229369/07217852.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal and Reference Noise Analysis of Time-Interleaving SAR and Partial-Interleaving Pipelined-SAR ADCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7217852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Thermal and Reference Noise Analysis of Time-Interleaving SAR and Partial-Interleaving Pipelined-SAR ADCs","volume":"62","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15414087","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7217852/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal and Reference Noise Analysis of Time-Interleaving SAR and Partial-Interleaving Pipelined-SAR ADCs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhong-2452331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102227S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7229369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7229369","articleId":"7217852","onlineDate":"21 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7218076,"authors":[{"name":"Shaneel Narayan","affiliation":["UNITEC Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Shaneel","lastName":"Narayan","id":"37321886200"},{"name":"Chandimal Jayawardena","affiliation":["UNITEC Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Chandimal","lastName":"Jayawardena","id":"38534239600"},{"name":"Jiaxin Wang","affiliation":["UNITEC Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Jiaxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085712999"},{"name":"Weizhi Ma","affiliation":["UNITEC Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Weizhi","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085700075"},{"name":"Geetu Geetu","affiliation":["Unitec Institute of Technology, Auckland, NZ"],"firstName":"Geetu","lastName":"Geetu","id":"37085718114"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6805-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6804-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6803-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7218076","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11n Standard","Throughput","Delays","Jitter","Wireless communication","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network performance evaluation","IP networks","operating systems (computers)","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11ac wireless device performance test","wireless technology","measurement-based performance evaluation","wireless network standards","wireless local area network performance","IEEE 802.11n technology","IPv6 802.11ac throughput","IPv4 802.11ac throughput","Windows 7 operating system computers","drop rate metrics","delay rate metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11ac","IEEE 802.11n 2.4 GHz band","IEEE 802.11n 5.0 GHz band","throughput","jitter","delay","drop rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218076","abstract":"With the wireless technologies being widely used, it is for sure that all types of wireless networking will become more and more popular now and in the near future.

The inherent elasticity and cost savings in public cloud computing have attracted many in the private and ever-cautious public sectors. Presuming the construct of a hybrid cloud offering composed of a combined public and private cloud solution, the public sector (government) has a daunting dilemma in balancing resilience and security. Key to the public sector requirement is continuity of mission critical and mission support operations. When involved in national security, disaster response, defense, or homeland security missions, the criticality of service availability is elevated. Delays in service provisioning and collaboration are often as a result of identity management issues within participating organizations.

There are certain common errors that occur during writing such as missing letters, extra letters, disordered letters, and misspelled letters. These kind of common spelling errors are called phonetics spelling errors. These are of a major concern while dealing with phonetics. Out of various problems that the phoneticians are trying to solve, major portion of it concentrates on varieties of spelling errors. Phonetic structures are greatly emphasized based on the effectiveness, appropriateness and accuracy. In order to keep abreast with the changing and challenging trends of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is of great importance that one should resolve the problems of spelling errors. To achieve the goal, numerous realistic and practical approaches have to be adopted that make use of spelling correction algorithms such as Edit distance, Habit distance, Soundex and Asoundex. Through the analysis of these algorithms, a new interface is put forward that calculates the Edit distance, thereby showing the overall comparative study of phonetic algorithms with the proposed modified Edit Distance algorithm. The interface computes the Edit distance between two strings in appropriate and intuitive way, contemplating with the comparisons shown in the distance table. The Results show that an average of 0.937 recall and 0.947 precision have been achieved with the F-measure 0.9417. Through these results, it is evident that the recall and F-measures are improved in the proposed Edit-Distance algorithm. The revised version of the edit distance algorithm consistently attains finer quality results in comparison with the traditional edit distance algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218113","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7181770/7218046/07218113.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metrics for evaluating phonetics machine translation in Natural Language Processing through modified Edit Distance algorithm-A na\u00efve approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218113/","displayDocTitle":"Metrics for evaluating phonetics machine translation in Natural Language Processing through modified Edit Distance algorithm-A na\u00efve approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15385527","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218113/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metrics for evaluating phonetics machine translation in Natural Language Processing through modified Edit Distance algorithm-A na\u00efve approach","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"CS409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082528S","chronDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7181770","isNumber":"7218046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7181770","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7218046","articleId":"7218113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218120,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The spectral environment is dynamically change to utilize the bandwidth optimally by allocating unused spectrum to the secondary users. The spectrum employment is developed by OFDMA. It overcomes the frequency selective evaporation. The joint subchannel allocation and power control strategy help to increase the energy through allocating the subchannel of each source. Optimal allocation of spectral efficiency acts a main role for achieving high data rate in wireless communication. A good usage of energy is important for wired communication as well as wireless communications. OFDMA systems maximize the total throughput of the system. An efficient resource allocation scheme can maximize the energy efficiency of all transmitters. The main objective of this paper is multiple user gain multiple resources through OFDMA based Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) with extended resource usage time. Pricing factor is differing from one user to another user. So, the priority based frequency allocation must be important to considered. Secondary users (SUs) could access the spectrum under pre-defined conditions. When the primary user's (PUs) spectrums are free that time only secondary users may access the spectrum. Each user have separate transmitter. The proposed system linear pricing technique used to avoid the spectrum competition between the secondary and primary transmitter. A distributed algorithm provides the plan for frequency distribution. Consider this entire concept then design the simulation model. To analyze the simulation result frequently then the problem delay is founded. The value of delay presents the performance of entire transmitter. Finally, the simulation result brings out the higher energy efficiency of each transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7181770/7218046/07218120.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218046","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency pricing based multi resource allocation in OFDMA cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Energy efficiency","Delays","Resource management","Interference","Cognitive radio","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency pricing based multiresource allocation","OFDMA cognitive radio networks","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","spectral environment","unused spectrum allocation","secondary users","spectrum employment","frequency selective evaporation","joint subchannel allocation","power control strategy","optimal allocation","spectral efficiency","wireless communication","wired communication","OFDMA systems","extended resource usage time","pricing factor","priority based frequency allocation","linear pricing technique","spectrum competition","secondary transmitter","primary transmitter","distributed algorithm","frequency distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Efficiency (EE)","JSPAC algorithm","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)","Cognitive Radio Network (CRN)","Multi-user","linear pricing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency pricing based multi resource allocation in OFDMA cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218120/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15385541","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency pricing based multi resource allocation in OFDMA cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"CS449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062632S","chronDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7181770","isNumber":"7218046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7181770","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7218046","articleId":"7218120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218130,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The speed of multiplier determines the speed of all Digital Signal Processors. This paper describes four multipliers that is Modified Booth Multiplier, Vedic Multiplier (Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra), Wallace Multiplier and Dadda Multiplier. In Modified Booth Multiplier Algorithm `0' is appended to the right of LSB and then three bits starting from the LSB are grouped as a set to decide the partial product. So as to increase its speed, desk calculators are used that perform the operation of shifting faster. Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra is performed by two multiplication techniques that is straight above multiplication and diagonal multiplication. Then finally, their sum is taken. Here reduction of multi bit multiplication to single bit multiplication takes place followed by the process of addition. Since there is only one step generation of partial product, carry propagation from LSB to MSB is reduced. There are three steps in which both Wallace and Dadda Multiplier work. They are partial product formation, reduction of partial products formed to two rows and addition of these two rows using carry propagation adder. Wallace Multiplier reduces all possible partial products and so has a smaller carry propagating adder whereas Dadda Multiplier performs only minimum necessary reduction and thus has a larger carry propagating adder. But as far as speed is concerned Dadda Multiplier is faster than Wallace Multiplier.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218139","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7181770/7218046/07218139.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of various high speed multipliers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218139/","displayDocTitle":"Study of various high speed multipliers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15385477","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218139/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of various high speed multipliers","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"EC165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046649S","chronDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7181770","isNumber":"7218046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7181770","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7218046","articleId":"7218139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218146,"authors":[{"name":"Ahilan A.","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Government College of Technology, Coimbatore"],"lastName":"Ahilan A.","id":"38232696600"},{"name":"Deepa P.","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Government College of Technology, Coimbatore"],"lastName":"Deepa P.","id":"38489392500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6805-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6804-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6803-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7218146","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Logic gates","Reliability","Encoding","Random access memory","Error correction codes","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","field programmable gate arrays","Hamming codes","matrix algebra","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified decimal matrix codes","FPGA configuration memory","multiple bit upsets","novel coding technique","SRAM","MBU","soft error tolerant encoder","soft error tolerant decoder","coding architecture","MDMC","reconfigurable array exclusive-OR logic","ReAXL","DMC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","configuration memory","Multiple Bit Upsets(MBU)","Reliability","Error Correcting Codes(ECC)"]}],"abstract":"A novel coding technique is proposed to protect the SRAM based configuration memories against multiple bit upsets (MBU) with minimum redundant bits. The proposed coding technique is based on soft error tolerant Encoder and Decoder. The coding architecture exploits Modified Decimal Matrix Codes (MDMC) to locate and correct soft error present in the memories. The MDMC is typically performed using reconfigurable Array Exclusive-OR Logic (ReAXL) to compute the equivalent decimal addition. The MDMC based on ReAXL can be dynamically reconfigured for both Encoding and decoding and reduces the chip area. The encoder creates the codeword for the original data bits and decoder calculates syndrome vector to confirm the soft error respectively. The proposed MDMC is analyzed and compared to the existing coding techniques such as Decimal Matrix Codes (DMC), Matrix codes (MC) and Hamming Codes. The result shows that the area, power and delay for the proposed MDMC is less compared to the existing coding techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218146","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7181770/7218046/07218146.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218046","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Decimal Matrix Codes in FPGA configuration memory for multiple bit upsets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218146/","displayDocTitle":"Modified Decimal Matrix Codes in FPGA configuration memory for multiple bit upsets","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218146/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15385512","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Decimal Matrix Codes in FPGA configuration memory for multiple bit upsets","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"EC294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051712S","chronDate":"8-10 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7181770","isNumber":"7218046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7181770","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7218046","articleId":"7218146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218148,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In D2D-enabled cellular networks, the interference among spectrum-sharing links is more severer than that in traditional cellular networks, which motivates the adoption of interference cancellation techniques such as successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. However, to date, how SIC can affect the performance of D2D-enabled cellular networks is still unknown. In this paper, we present an analytical framework for studying the performance of SIC in large-scale D2D-enabled cellular networks using the tools from stochastic geometry. To facilitate the interference analysis, we propose the approach of stochastic equivalence of the interference, which converts the two-tier interference (interference from both the cellular tier and D2D tier) to an equivalent single-tier interference. Based on the proposed stochastic equivalence models, we derive the general expressions for the successful transmission probabilities of cellular uplinks and D2D links with infinite and finite SIC capabilities respectively. We demonstrate how SIC affects the performance of large-scale D2D-enabled cellular networks by both analytical and numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218365","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218365.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of successive interference cancellation in D2D-enabled cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218365/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of successive interference cancellation in D2D-enabled cellular networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385311","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218365/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of successive interference cancellation in D2D-enabled cellular networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p37ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075127S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218366,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajia Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Jiajia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37715415800"},{"name":"Shangwei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Shangwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085616852"},{"name":"Hiroki Nishiyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Nishiyama","id":"37410448300"},{"name":"Nei Kato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Nei","lastName":"Kato","id":"37085448976"},{"name":"Jun Guo","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085616424"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218366","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":899},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Channel allocation","Interference","Downlink","Data communication","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","probability","resource allocation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-hop connection","optimal network parameters","cellular link","ergodic rate","coverage probability","D2D overlaying multi-channel downlink cellular networks","stochastic geometry analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","downlink","performance analysis","multi-channel"]}],"abstract":"Based on the tool of stochastic geometry, we present in this paper a framework for analyzing the coverage probability and ergodic rate in a D2D overlaying multi-channel downlink cellular network.

The wireless full-duplex transmission, as one of promising candidate techniques for 5G, can significantly boost the spectrum efficiency of the wireless networks, thus providing a powerful thrust to optimize the quality-of-service (QoS) performances for the wireless networks. However, due to the heterogeneity caused by different types of simultaneous traffics over the wireless full-duplex link, supporting QoS guarantees for wireless full-duplex networks imposes the new challenges that we need to provide heterogeneous QoS guarantees for different types of traffics over the same link simultaneously. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning framework for bidirectional transmission based wireless full-duplex networks. In particular, we formulate the optimization problems to maximize the system throughput subject to heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements. Then, we convert the resulted non-convex optimization problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem, solving which we can derive the optimal QoS-driven power allocation scheme to maximize the system throughput while guaranteeing the heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements. The extensive simulation results obtained show that our proposed QoS-driven power allocation scheme for heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements can achieve larger aggregate system throughput than the scheme for the homogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirement over 5G mobile wireless full-duplex networks.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218367","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"55","endPage":"63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning over 5G wireless full-duplex networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning over 5G wireless full-duplex networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218367/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385317","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218367/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning over 5G wireless full-duplex networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p55cheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055507S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218377,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37406713600"},{"name":"Chin-Jung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Chin-Jung","lastName":"Liu","id":"38466937000"},{"name":"Xi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37072205200"},{"name":"Li Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37281269700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218377","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Wideband","Unicast","Radio transmitters","Interference","OFDM","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient broadcast","fragmented spectrum","cognitive radio networks","spectrum resources","channel rendezvous","minimum latency scheduling problem","wideband channel","spectrum fragment agile broadcast scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218377","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218377","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","abstract":"To improve spectrum utilization, cognitive radio (CR) is introduced to detect and exploit available spectrum resources autonomously. The flexible spectrum use imposes special challenges on broadcast because different CR devices may detect different available spectrum fragments at different locations. The sender and the receivers have to agree on spectrum fragments that will be used for broadcast. There may not exist a common spectrum fragment that is available to all receivers. Most existing work assumes that a device works only in a single channel and thus the sender has to broadcast multiple times in different channels to reach all receivers. The broadcast problem is studied as a channel rendezvous and minimum latency scheduling problem. Recent spectrum-agile designs have enabled a device to utilize partially occupied spectrum. We thus view a wideband channel as an aggregation of multiple narrow channels that can be evaluated independently. A Spectrum Fragment Agile Broadcast (SFAB) scheme is introduced in this paper to support efficient broadcast on fragmented spectrum. It aims at achieving spectrum agreement between the transmitter and the receivers efficiently and maximizing the channel width used for broadcast regardless of the spectrum availability differences at receivers. We validate the effectiveness of SFAB through implementation on the GNU Radio / USRP platform and use ns-2 simulations to evaluate the performance in large deployments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"145","endPage":"153","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218377.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient broadcast on fragmented spectrum in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218377/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient broadcast on fragmented spectrum in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385405","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient broadcast on fragmented spectrum in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p145huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077982S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218378,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoquan Gu","affiliation":["Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoquan","lastName":"Gu","id":"37071868200"},{"name":"Haosen Pu","affiliation":["Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haosen","lastName":"Pu","id":"37085685963"},{"name":"Qiang-Sheng Hua","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Qiang-Sheng","lastName":"Hua","id":"37951334300"},{"name":"Francis C M.

One of their fundamental procedures is to construct a communication link on a common channel for the users, which is referred as rendezvous. In reality, the capability to sense the spectrum may vary from user to user, and such users form what is known as a heterogeneous cognitive radio network (HCRN). The licensed spectrum is divided in to n channels, U = {1, 2,..., n}. We denote the capability of user i as C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n \u2286 U and the set of available channels (i.e. the channels not occupied by the paying users) as V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n \u2286 C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n.

In traditional wireless networks, there is an inherent trade-off in determining the packet size. First of all, compared with long packets, short packets are less likely to be affected by the error-prone wireless channels. However, short packets suffer overhead due to headers. In mobile cognitive radio (CR) networks, determining the secondary user (SU) packet size becomes much more complicated and critical. In addition to all the impacts in traditional wireless networks, the primary user (PU) activity and the mobility of SUs and PUs have significant impacts on the SU packet size. Moreover, the channel fading caused by the SU mobility also has an impact on the SU packet size. More importantly, all these impacts on SU packet size constantly vary with time and space, which makes this issue extremely challenging. Without a careful design of the SU packet size, both SU and PU transmissions may suffer severe performance degradation. In this paper, the optimal SU packet size issue in mobile CR networks under fading channels is studied. We mathematically model these impacts and derive the optimal SU packet size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically investigates the optimal SU packet size issue in mobile CR networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218379/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15385279","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218379/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal secondary user packet size in mobile cognitive radio networks under fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal secondary user packet size in mobile cognitive radio networks under fading channels","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p163song.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075221S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218384,"authors":[{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402885600"},{"name":"Dmitri I.

Managing the multinetworks for mobile IoT access is a key challenge. Software-defined networking (SDN) is emerging as a promising paradigm for quick configuration of network devices, but its application in multinetworks with frequent IoT access is not well studied. In this paper we present UbiFlow, the first software-defined IoT system for ubiquitous flow control and mobility management in multinetworks. UbiFlow adopts distributed controllers to divide urban-scale SDN into different geographic partitions. A distributed hashing based overlay structure is proposed to maintain network scalability and consistency. Based on this UbiFlow overlay structure, relevant issues pertaining to mobility management such as scalable control, fault tolerance, and load balancing have been carefully examined and studied. The UbiFlow controller differentiates flow scheduling based on the per-device requirement and whole-partition capability. Therefore, it can present a network status view and optimized selection of access points in multinetworks to satisfy IoT flow requests, while guaranteeing network performance in each partition. Simulation and realistic testbed experiments confirm that UbiFlow can successfully achieve scalable mobility management and robust flow scheduling in IoT multinetworks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218384/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15385188","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218384/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"UbiFlow: Mobility management in urban-scale software defined IoT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UbiFlow: Mobility management in urban-scale software defined IoT","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p208wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086711S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":7218391,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Kuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38666342300"},{"name":"Xiaohui Liang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Liang","id":"37716367100"},{"name":"Rongxing Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rongxing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37309741500"},{"name":"Kan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Kan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085635921"},{"name":"Xuemin Sherman Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuemin Sherman","lastName":"Shen","id":"37065811100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218391","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":573},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a Social-based Mobile Sybil Detection (SMSD) scheme to detect Sybil attackers from their abnormal contacts and pseudonym changing behaviors. Specifically, we first define four levels of Sybil attackers in mobile environments according to their attacking capabilities. We then exploit mobile users' contacts and their pseudonym changing behaviors to distinguish Sybil attackers from normal users. To alleviate the storage and computation burden of mobile users, the cloud server is introduced to store mobile user's contact information and to perform the Sybil detection. Furthermore, we utilize a ring structure associated with mobile user's contact signatures to resist the contact forgery by mobile users and cloud servers. In addition, investigating mobile user's contact distribution and social proximity, we propose a semi-supervised learning with Hidden Markov Model to detect the colluded mobile users. Security analysis demonstrates that the SMSD can resist the Sybil attackers from the defined four levels, and the extensive trace-driven simulation shows that the SMSD can detect these Sybil attackers with high accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218391.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"279","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting mobile social behaviors for Sybil detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Servers","Mobile computing","Hidden Markov models","Aggregates","Computers","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","network servers","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile social behaviors","social-based mobile Sybil detection","Sybil attackers","abnormal contacts","pseudonym changing behaviors","mobile environments","cloud server","mobile user contact signatures","mobile user contact distribution","social proximity","semisupervised learning","hidden Markov model","security analysis","trace-driven simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting mobile social behaviors for Sybil detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385340","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting mobile social behaviors for Sybil detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p271zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087146S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7218395,"authors":[{"name":"Bang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Bang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085762051"},{"name":"Di Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409788400"},{"name":"Zongpeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Zongpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085756565"},{"name":"H.

Traditional approaches recover all-pair latencies in a network from sampled measurements using either Euclidean embedding or matrix factorization. However, these approaches targeting static or mean network latency prediction are insufficient to predict personal device latencies, due to unstable and time-varying network conditions, triangle inequality violation and unknown rank of latency matrices. In this paper, by analyzing latency measurements from the Seattle platform, we propose new methods for both static latency estimation as well as the dynamic estimation problem given 3D latency matrices sampled over time. We propose a distance-feature decomposition algorithm that can decompose latency matrices into a distance component and a network feature component, and further leverage the structured pattern inherent in the 3D sampled data to increase estimation accuracy. Extensive evaluations driven by real-world traces show that our proposed approaches significantly outperform various state-of-the-art latency prediction techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Linear matrix inequalities","Extraterrestrial measurements","Peer-to-peer computing","Three-dimensional displays","Prediction algorithms","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","matrix decomposition","mobile computing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network latency prediction","personal devices","3D sampling","matrix factorization","Euclidean embedding","mobile devices","time-varying network conditions","triangle inequality violation","Seattle platform","static latency estimation","dynamic estimation problem","3D latency matrices","distance-feature decomposition algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218395","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218395.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network latency prediction for personal devices: Distance-feature decomposition from 3D sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network latency prediction for personal devices: Distance-feature decomposition from 3D sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218395/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218395/","accessionNumber":"15385280","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network latency prediction for personal devices: Distance-feature decomposition from 3D sampling","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p307liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067016S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7218397,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085480804"},{"name":"Xiaobing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37539934800"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37400139600"},{"name":"Sanglu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"firstName":"Sanglu","lastName":"Lu","id":"38184308100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218397","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":784},"abstract":"Heterogeneous cellular networks use small base stations, such as femtocells and WiFi APs, to offload traffic from macrocells.

In this paper, we propose to use an auction-based algorithm - Femto-Matching, to achieve both load balancing among base stations and fairness among users. Femto-Matching optimally solves the global proportional fairness problem in polynomial time by transforming it into an equivalent matching problem. Furthermore, it can efficiently utilize the capacity of randomly deployed small cells. Our trace-driven simulations show Femto-Matching can reduce the load of macrocells by more than 30% compared to non-cooperative game based strategies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218397.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"333","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femto-matching: Efficient traffic offloading in heterogeneous cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Macrocell networks","Throughput","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","game theory","multi-access systems","polynomials","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femto-matching","traffic offloading","heterogeneous cellular networks","base stations","femtocells","WiFi AP","macrocells","network operators","auction-based algorithm","load balancing","polynomial time","equivalent matching problem","noncooperative game based strategies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Femto-matching: Efficient traffic offloading in heterogeneous cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218397/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385145","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femto-matching: Efficient traffic offloading in heterogeneous cellular networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p325wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114754S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218410,"authors":[{"name":"Jelena Misi\u0107","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Misi\u0107"},{"name":"Md.

This technique requires Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitting AP to set antenna gains and phases to enable simultaneous reception through beamforming. The AP must also select both the mode (number of transmit and collective receive antennas) and the user set prior to transmission. While the ideal mode and user selection is a function of CSI, CSI must be estimated with an overhead intensive channel sounding process. We design, implement, and evaluate Pre-sounding User and Mode selection Algorithm (PUMA), a method for mode and user selection prior to channel sounding. We show that even without CSI, PUMA (i) exploits theoretical properties of MU-MIMO system scaling with respect to mode, (ii) characterizes the relative cost of each potential mode, and (iii) estimates per-stream transmission rate and aggregate throughput in each mode for a potential user set, all without CSI. Once PUMA has selected the appropriate mode and user group, the chosen protocol's channel sounding method is used on the intended user subset to carry out the transmission. We show that, on average, PUMA selects the mode and group that achieves an aggregate rate within 3% of the saturation throughput of what would have been achieved by sounding all users (which would require significant additional overhead). Moreover, we show that PUMA obtains 30% higher aggregate throughput compared to the best fixed-mode policy that uses the maximum number of available transmit and receive antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218411.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"459","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode and user selection for multi-user MIMO WLANs without CSI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Aggregates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user selection","multiuser MIMO WLAN","MIMO access point","overhead intensive channel sounding process","presounding user and mode selection algorithm","PUMA algorithm","relative cost","perstream transmission rate","aggregate throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mode and user selection for multi-user MIMO WLANs without CSI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218411/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385302","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode and user selection for multi-user MIMO WLANs without CSI","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p451anand.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069297S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218417,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Singh","affiliation":["Texas A&M University College Station, College Station, TX, US"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Singh"},{"name":"Xueying Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085395257"},{"name":"P.R.

This is motivated by the considerable savings in automobile weight, simplification of manufacturability, and future upgradability. A key issue is how to schedule the nodes on the shared access point so as to provide regular packet delivery. In this and other similar applications, the mean of the inter-delivery times of packets, i.e., throughput, is not sufficient to guarantee service-regularity. The time-averaged variance of the inter-delivery times of packets is also an important metric. So motivated, we consider a wireless network where an Access Point schedules real-time generated packets to nodes over a fading wireless channel. We are interested in designing simple policies which achieve optimal mean-variance tradeoff in interdelivery times of packets by minimizing the sum of time-averaged means and variances over all clients. Our goal is to explore the full range of the Pareto frontier of all weighted linear combinations of mean and variance so that one can fully exploit the design possibilities. We transform this problem into a Markov decision process and show that the problem of choosing which node's packet to transmit in each slot can be formulated as a bandit problem. We establish that this problem is indexable and explicitly derive the Whittle indices. The resulting Index policy is optimal in certain cases. We also provide upper and lower bounds on the cost for any policy. Extensive simulations show that Index policies perform better than previously proposed policies.fading wireless channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Index policies for optimal mean-variance trade-off of inter-delivery times in real-time sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218417","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218417.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Index policies for optimal mean-variance trade-off of inter-delivery times in real-time sensor networks","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218417/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385149","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Index policies for optimal mean-variance trade-off of inter-delivery times in real-time sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p505singh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052371S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7218418,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Galluccio","affiliation":["University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Galluccio","id":"37265701900"},{"name":"Sebastiano Milardo","affiliation":["CNIT Research Unit Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Sebastiano","lastName":"Milardo","id":"38469622600"},{"name":"Giacomo Morabito","affiliation":["University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Morabito","id":"37085619907"},{"name":"Sergio Palazzo","affiliation":["University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Palazzo","id":"37085449258"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218418","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":197,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Protocols","Topology","Wireless communication","Network topology","Software","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite state machines","software defined networking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN-WISE","stateful SDN solution","wireless sensor networks","software defined networking","SDN network controller","programmable sensor node","finite state machines","API","application program interface","OMNeT++ simulated network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDN-WISE: Design, prototyping and experimentation of a stateful SDN solution for WIreless SEnsor networks","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","endPage":"521","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218418","startPage":"513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218418","abstract":"In this paper SDN-WISE, a software defined networking (SDN) solution for wireless sensor networks, is introduced.

This paper provides a step towards this goal with a twofold contribution. We first describe the design and prototyping of a wake-up receiver (WRx) and its integration to a wireless sensor node. Our WRx features very low power consumption (<; 1.3\u03bcW), high sensitivity (up to -55dBm), fast reactivity (wake-up time of 130\u03bcs), and selective addressing, a key enabler of new high performance protocols. We then present ALBA-WUR, a cross-layer solution for data gathering in sensing systems that redesigns a previous leading protocol, ALBA-R, extending it to exploit the features of our WRx. We evaluate the performance of ALBA-WUR via simulations, showing that the use of the WRx produces remarkable energy savings (up to five orders of magnitude), and achieves lifetimes that are decades longer than those obtained by ALBA-R in sensing systems with duty cycling, while keeping latencies at bay.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218419","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218419.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"522","endPage":"530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond duty cycling: Wake-up radio with selective awakenings for long-lived wireless sensing systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beyond duty cycling: Wake-up radio with selective awakenings for long-lived wireless sensing systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218419/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385397","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218419/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond duty cycling: Wake-up radio with selective awakenings for long-lived wireless sensing systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p522spenza.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066514S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218421,"authors":[{"name":"Michela Becchi","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Columbia"],"firstName":"Michela","lastName":"Becchi","id":"37703614000"},{"name":"Anat Bremler-Barr","affiliation":["The Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, Israel"],"firstName":"Anat","lastName":"Bremler-Barr","id":"38277511700"},{"name":"David Hay","affiliation":["The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hay","id":"37317261300"},{"name":"Omer Kochba","affiliation":["The Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, Israel"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Kochba","id":"37085691534"},{"name":"Yaron Koral","affiliation":["The Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Yaron","lastName":"Koral","id":"38271471600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218421","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Automata","Acceleration","Inspection","Estimation","Conferences","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","deterministic automata","finite automata","hypermedia","pattern matching","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regular expression matching","compressed HTTP traffic","hypertext transfer protocol","GZIP protocol","NFA-based implementation","DFA-based implementation","deterministic finite automata","nondeterministic finite automata"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on regular expression matching over compressed traffic. The need for such matching arises from two independent trends. First, the volume and share of compressed HTTP traffic is constantly increasing. Second, due to their superior expressibility, current Deep Packet Inspection engines use regular expressions more and more frequently. We present an algorithmic framework to accelerate such matching, taking advantage of information gathered when the traffic was initially compressed. HTTP compression is typically performed through the GZIP protocol, which uses back-references to repeated strings. Our algorithm is based on calculating (for every byte) the minimum number of (previous) bytes that can be part of a future regular expression matching. When inspecting a back-reference, only these bytes should be taken into account, thus enabling one to skip repeated strings almost entirely without missing a match. We show that our generic framework works with either NFA-based or DFA-based implementations and gains performance boosts of more than 70%. Moreover, it can be readily adapted to most existing regular expression matching algorithms, which usually are based either on NFA, DFA or combinations of the two. Finally, we discuss other applications in which calculating the number of relevant bytes becomes handy, even when the traffic is not compressed.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218421","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218421.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating regular expression matching over compressed HTTP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218421/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating regular expression matching over compressed HTTP","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385169","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218421/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating regular expression matching over compressed HTTP","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p540becchi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106303S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218425,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085694677"},{"name":"Xiaowen Chu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Chu","id":"37271636500"},{"name":"Hai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279507400"},{"name":"Yiu-Wing Leung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University"],"firstName":"Yiu-Wing","lastName":"Leung","id":"37271603500"},{"name":"Zongpeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Zongpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37309823800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218425","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cloud computing","Procurement","Algorithm design and analysis","Pricing","Servers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cost reduction","pricing","procurement","resource allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online procurement auctions","client-assisted cloud storage systems","cloud computing technology","cloud based data storage service","cloud storage service provider","bandwidth cost","hybrid cloud storage architecture","underutilized storage","network resource","storage client","economic mechanism","local resource","provider cost minimization","online procurement auction mechanism","asynchronous user request arrivals","truthfulness conditions","price-based allocation rule","payment rule","online algorithm design problem","marginal pricing function","competitive ratio","social cost","offline VCG mechanism","resource pooling cost"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218425","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218425.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online procurement auctions for resource pooling in client-assisted cloud storage systems","abstract":"Latest developments in cloud computing technologies have enabled a plethora of cloud based data storage services. Cloud storage service providers are facing significant bandwidth cost as the user population scales. Such bandwidth cost can be substantially slashed by exploring a hybrid cloud storage architecture that takes advantage of under-utilized storage and network resources at storage clients. A critical component in the new hybrid cloud storage architecture is an economic mechanism that incentivizes clients to contribute their local resources, while at the same time minimizes the provider's cost for pooling those resources. This work studies online procurement auction mechanisms towards these goals. The online nature of the auction is in line with asynchronous user request arrivals in practice. After carefully characterizing truthfulness conditions under the online procurement auction paradigm, we prove that truthfulness can be guaranteed by a price-based allocation rule and payment rule. Our truthfulness characterization actually converts the mechanism design problem into an online algorithm design problem, with a marginal pricing function for resources as variables set by cloud storage service providers for online procurement auction. We derive the marginal pricing function for the online algorithm. We also prove the competitive ratio of the social cost of our algorithm against that of the offline VCG mechanism and of the resource pooling cost of our algorithm against that of the offline optimal auction. Simulation studies driven by real-world traces are conducted to show the efficacy of our online auction mechanism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218425/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385168","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Online procurement auctions for resource pooling in client-assisted cloud storage systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online procurement auctions for resource pooling in client-assisted cloud storage systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p576zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122915S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7218426,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Sun","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085732937"},{"name":"Zizhan Zheng","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE"],"firstName":"Zizhan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085734466"},{"name":"C.

Recent system measurements have shown that the data retrieving delay in storage clouds is highly variable, which may result in a long latency tail. One crucial idea to improve the delay performance is to retrieve multiple data copies by using parallel downloading threads. However, how to optimally schedule these downloading threads to minimize the data retrieving delay remains to be an important open problem. In this paper, we develop low-complexity thread scheduling policies for several important classes of data downloading time distributions, and prove that these policies are either delay-optimal or within a constant gap from the optimum delay performance. These theoretical results hold for an arbitrary arrival process of read requests that may contain finite or infinite read requests, and for heterogeneous MDS storage codes that can support diverse storage redundancy and reliability requirements for different data files. Our numerical results show that the delay performance of the proposed policies is significantly better than that of First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) policies considered in prior work.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218426","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218426.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provably delay efficient data retrieving in storage clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Provably delay efficient data retrieving in storage clouds","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385219","htmlLink":"/document/7218426/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provably delay efficient data retrieving in storage clouds","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p585sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091589S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7218429,"authors":[{"name":"Shimin Gong","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design"],"firstName":"Shimin","lastName":"Gong"},{"name":"Lingjie Duan","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design"],"firstName":"Lingjie","lastName":"Duan"},{"name":"Ping Wang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218429","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218429","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Robustness","Interference","Throughput","Channel estimation","Power control","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel estimation","cognitive radio","energy harvesting","optimisation","power control","radio networks","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","robust optimization","energy harvesting","primary users","secondary users","PU receivers","SU-PU interference channels","channel estimation","energy causality constraint","power control","worst-case interference constraint","transmission probability","nonconvex throughput maximization problem","robust constraint","successive approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218429","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218429.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust optimization of cognitive radio networks powered by energy harvesting","abstract":"We consider a cognitive radio network, where primary users (PUs) share their spectrum with energy harvesting (EH) enabled secondary users (SUs), conditioned on a limited SUs' interference at PU receivers. Due to the lack of information exchange between SUs and PUs, the SU-PU interference channels are subject to uncertainty in channel estimation. Besides channel uncertainty, SUs' EH profile is also subject to spatial and temporal variations, which enforce an energy causality constraint on SUs' transmit power control and affect SUs' interference at PU receivers. Considering both the channel and EH uncertainties, we propose a robust design for SUs' power control to maximize SUs' throughput performance. Our robust design targets at the worst-case interference constraint to provide a robust protection for PUs, while guarantees a transmission probability to reflect SUs' minimum QoS requirements. To make the non-convex throughput maximization problem tractable, we develop a convex approximation for each robust constraint and successfully design a successive approximation approach that converges to the global optimum of the throughput objective. Simulations show that SUs will change transmission strategies according to PUs' sensitivity to interference, and we also exploit the impact of SUs' EH profile (e.g., mean, variance, and correlation) on SUs' power control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218429/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15385344","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust optimization of cognitive radio networks powered by energy harvesting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust optimization of cognitive radio networks powered by energy harvesting","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p612gong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021222S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7218429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7218432,"authors":[{"name":"Yanzhi Dou","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"firstName":"Yanzhi","lastName":"Dou","id":"37085612593"},{"name":"Kexiong Curtis Zeng","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"firstName":"Kexiong Curtis","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085581099"},{"name":"Yaling Yang","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"firstName":"Yaling","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292964500"},{"name":"Danfeng Daphne Yao","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"firstName":"Danfeng","lastName":"Daphne Yao","id":"37085614989"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218432","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Runtime","Hidden Markov models","Malware","Databases","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","invasive software","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation-based malware detection system for CR","madeCR","cognitive radio","intelligent radio technology","spectrum utilization","software-oriented design","wireless infrastructures","anomaly detection method"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is an intelligent radio technology to boost spectrum utilization and is likely to be widely spread in the near future.

Cost-effective deployment, a fundamental issue of visual barrier coverage, considers how to deploy the fewest camera sensors along the barrier to detect intruders (e.g., capture faces) with desirable performance. Existing visual barrier coverage approaches like full-view coverage require numerous camera sensors for capturing intruders' faces deterministically for any trajectory and facing angle. However, intruders' trajectories and facing angles are bounded and deterministic intruder detection requires many camera sensors for rare intrusion cases. Certain practical applications can tolerate limited intrusion mis-detection given budget limitations. This paper proposes local face-view barrier coverage, a novel concept that achieves statistical barrier coverage in camera sensor networks leveraging intruders' trajectory lengths \u2113 along the barrier and head rotation angles \u03b4. Using (\u2113, \u03b4) and other parameters, we derive a rigorous probability bound for intruder detection for local face-view barrier coverage via a feasible deployment pattern. Our detection probability bound and deployment pattern can guide practical camera sensor network deployments with camera sensor budgets. Extensive evaluations show that local face-view barrier coverage requires up to 50% fewer camera sensors than full-view barrier coverage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218437/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385229","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Local face-view barrier coverage in camera sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local face-view barrier coverage in camera sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p684yu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.169733S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":7218444,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085613224"},{"name":"Hongxing Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Hongxing","lastName":"Li","id":"37085473117"},{"name":"Hao Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085521626"},{"name":"Derya Cansever","affiliation":["US Army CERDEC, USA"],"firstName":"Derya","lastName":"Cansever","id":"37085687413"},{"name":"Prasant Mohapatra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Prasant","lastName":"Mohapatra","id":"37085388919"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218444","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1646},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Nash equilibrium","Cost function","Computer security","Joints","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic defense strategy","advanced persistent threat","APT","cyber security","attack process","malicious gain","two-layer game model","defense/attack game","information-trading game","Nash equilibrium"]}],"abstract":"The landscape of cyber security has been reformed dramatically by the recently emerging Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is uniquely featured by the stealthy, continuous, sophisticated and well-funded attack process for long-term malicious gain, which render the current defense mechanisms inapplicable. A novel design of defense strategy, continuously combating APT in a long time-span with imperfect/incomplete information on attacker's actions, is urgently needed. The challenge is even more escalated when APT is coupled with the insider threat (a major threat in cyber-security), where insiders could trade valuable information to APT attacker for monetary gains. The interplay among the defender, APT attacker and insiders should be judiciously studied to shed insights on a more secure defense system. In this paper, we consider the joint threats from APT attacker and the insiders, and characterize the fore-mentioned interplay as a two-layer game model, i.e., a defense/attack game between defender and APT attacker and an information-trading game among insiders. Through rigorous analysis, we identify the best response strategies for each player and prove the existence of Nash Equilibrium for both games. Extensive numerical study further verifies our analytic results and examines the impact of different system configurations on the achievable security level.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218444","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"747","endPage":"755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic defense strategy against advanced persistent threat with insiders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic defense strategy against advanced persistent threat with insiders","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218444/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385211","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218444/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic defense strategy against advanced persistent threat with insiders","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p747hu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065074S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218445,"authors":[{"name":"Jad Hachem","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Jad","lastName":"Hachem","id":"37706102900"},{"name":"Nikhil Karamchandani","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Karamchandani","id":"37424128200"},{"name":"Suhas Diggavi","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Suhas","lastName":"Diggavi","id":"37269046100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218445","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Joining processes","Cache memory","Conferences","Computers","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","broadcast communication","cache storage","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content caching","content delivery","heterogeneous wireless networks","heterogeneous wireless architectures","local-coverage wireless access points","data rates","large-coverage macrocell base stations","coded caching-and-delivery scheme","content prefetching","user demands","local AP","BS broadcast transmission","nonuniform content popularity profile","transmission cost","storage cost","information-theoretic bounds","transmission rate","YouTube dataset","access cost","5G systems"]}],"abstract":"Emerging heterogeneous wireless architectures consist of a dense deployment of local-coverage wireless access points (APs) with high data rates, along with sparsely-distributed, large-coverage macro-cell base stations (BS). We design a coded caching-and-delivery scheme for such architectures that equips APs with storage, enabling content pre-fetching prior to knowing user demands. Users requesting content are served by connecting to local APs with cached content, as well as by listening to a BS broadcast transmission. For any given content popularity profile, the goal is to design the caching-and-delivery scheme so as to optimally trade off the transmission cost at the BS against the storage cost at the APs and the user cost of connecting to multiple APs. We design a coded caching scheme for non-uniform content popularity that dynamically allocates user access to APs based on requested content. We demonstrate the approximate optimality of our scheme with respect to information-theoretic bounds. We numerically evaluate it on a YouTube dataset and quantify the trade-off between transmission rate, storage, and access cost. Our numerical results also suggest the intriguing possibility that, to gain most of the benefits of coded caching, it suffices to divide the content into a small number of popularity classes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content caching and delivery over heterogeneous wireless networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218445","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218445.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Content caching and delivery over heterogeneous wireless networks","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218445/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385180","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content caching and delivery over heterogeneous wireless networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p756hachem.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079232S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218450,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Baccelli","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Baccelli","id":"37282369900"},{"name":"Xinchen Zhang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xinchen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085442286"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218450","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":956},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Shadow mapping","Joints","Analytical models","Fading","Laplace equations","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban wireless networks","correlated shadowing","analytically tractable stochastic geometry","path loss functions","nonline-of-sight links","distance-based LOS path loss","blockage shadowing","interference distribution","cellular networks","coverage probability","NLOS interference"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an analytically tractable stochastic geometry model for urban wireless networks, where the locations of the nodes and the shadowing are highly correlated and different path loss functions can be applied to line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links. Using a distance-based LOS path loss model and a blockage (shadowing)-based NLOS path loss model, we are able to derive the distribution of the interference observed at a typical location and the joint distribution at different locations. When applied to cellular networks, this model leads to tractable expressions for the coverage probability (SINR distribution). We show that this model captures important features of urban wireless networks, which cannot be analyzed using existing models. The numerical results also suggest that even in the presence of significant penetration loss, ignoring the NLOS interference can lead to erroneous estimations on coverage. They also suggest that allowing users to be associated with NLOS BSs may provide a non-trivial gain on coverage.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218450","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218450.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"801","endPage":"809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A correlated shadowing model for urban wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A correlated shadowing model for urban wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218450/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385372","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218450/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A correlated shadowing model for urban wireless networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p801baccelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081498S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7218451,"authors":[{"name":"Sangki Yun","affiliation":["The University of Texas, Austin"],"firstName":"Sangki","lastName":"Yun","id":"37071891300"},{"name":"Lili Qiu","affiliation":["The University of Texas, Austin"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085532011"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218451","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1517},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Interference","Decoding","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiFi co-existence","LTE co-existence","unlicensed spectrum","LTE antennas","WiFi antennas","decode signal","interfered signal","MIMO work","cross technology interference","WiFi transmission","LTE transmission","USRP implementation"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by the recent push to deploy LTE in unlicensed spectrum, this paper develops a novel system to enable co-existence between LTE and WiFi.

Here, content can either be accessed directly from a back-end server (where content resides permanently) or be obtained from one of multiple in-network caches. To access a piece of content, a user must decide whether to route its request to a cache or to the back-end server. Additionally, caches must decide which content to cache. We investigate the problem complexity of two problem formulations, where the direct path to the back-end server is modeled as i) a congestion-sensitive or ii) a congestion-insensitive path, reflecting whether or not the delay of the uncached path to the back-end server depends on the user request load, respectively. We show that the problem is NP-complete in both cases. We prove that under the congestion-insensitive model the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time if each piece of content is requested by only one user, or when there are at most two caches in the network. We also identify a structural property of the user-cache graph that potentially makes the problem NP-complete. For the congestion-sensitive model, we prove that the problem remains NP-complete even if there is only one cache in the network and each content is requested by only one user. We show that approximate solutions can be found for both models within a (1 - 1/e) factor of the optimal solution, and demonstrate a greedy algorithm that is found to be within 1% of optimal for small problem sizes. Through trace-driven simulations we evaluate the performance of our greedy algorithms, which show up to a 50% reduction in average delay over solutions based on LRU content caching.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218465","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"936","endPage":"944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the complexity of optimal routing and content caching in heterogeneous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of optimal routing and content caching in heterogeneous networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218465/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385366","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of optimal routing and content caching in heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p936dehghan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039997S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"76","articleId":"7218465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218466,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Poloczek","affiliation":["University of Warwick/TU, Berlin"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Poloczek","id":"38572918800"},{"name":"Florin Ciucu","affiliation":["University of Warwick"],"firstName":"Florin","lastName":"Ciucu","id":"37322160800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218466","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Multiaccess communication","Queueing analysis","Stochastic processes","MIMO","Conferences","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","channel capacity","delay estimation","Markov processes","MIMO communication","quality of service","queueing theory","radio links","space division multiplexing","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random access protocol","teletraffic theory","link layer wireless channel","QoS metrics","arrival martingale","martingale extension","service martingale","queueing analysis","bursty source sharing","MAC channel","stochastic delay bound","Markovian source sharing","ALOHA channel","CSMA/CA channel","in-source scheduling","MIMO spatial multiplexing","delay analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a martingale extension of effective-capacity, a concept which has been instrumental in teletraffic theory to model the link-layer wireless channel and analyze QoS metrics.

In most previous solutions, users query service data from the untrusted LBS server when needed, and discard the data immediately after use. However, the data can be cached and reused to answer future queries. This prevents some queries from being sent to the LBS server and thus improves privacy. Although a few previous works recognize the usefulness of caching for better privacy, they use caching in a pretty straightforward way, and do not show the quantitative relation between caching and privacy. In this paper, we propose a caching-based solution to protect location privacy in LBSs, and rigorously explore how much caching can be used to improve privacy. Specifically, we propose an entropy-based privacy metric which for the first time incorporates the effect of caching on privacy. Then we design two novel caching-aware dummy selection algorithms which enhance location privacy through maximizing both the privacy of the current query and the dummies' contribution to cache. Evaluations show that our algorithms provide much better privacy than previous caching-oblivious and caching-aware solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218474.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1025","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing privacy through caching in location-based services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Servers","Measurement","Mobile communication","Entropy","Algorithm design and analysis","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","entropy","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy enhancement","location-based services","privacy protection","users query service data","untrusted LBS server","caching-based solution","entropy-based privacy metric","caching-aware dummy selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing privacy through caching in location-based services","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218474/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385347","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing privacy through caching in location-based services","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1017niu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09039S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":7218477,"authors":[{"name":"Yipei Niu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yipei","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085734985"},{"name":"Bin Luo","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085728054"},{"name":"Fangming Liu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Fangming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37308022700"},{"name":"Jiangchuan Liu","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Jiangchuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085335146"},{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"37085721745"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218477","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Computers","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","delays","electronic commerce","Lyapunov methods","optimisation","outsourcing","queueing theory","retail data processing","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash crowd","cost-effective service provisioning","online shopping","e-commerce Websites","promotion season","private infrastructure","Website unavailability","hybrid cloud solution","private cloud workload relief","IaaS public cloud","user request distribution","delay minimization","cost-saving","queueing theory","response time","performance-cost tradeoff","Lyapunov optimization technique","online decision algorithm","outsourcing cost","e-commerce service"]}],"abstract":"With rapid development in online shopping, e-commerce websites are facing intensive user requests from an increasing number of customers.

Such severe flash crowds can be addressed by leveraging hybrid cloud solution, which relieves workloads of the private cloud by offloading the excessive user requests to the IaaS public cloud. However, the bursty and fluctuation of flash crowds bring challenges to distributing user requests with targest of delay-minimizing and cost-saving. In his paper, we apply the queueing theory to evaluate the average response time and explore the tradeoff between performance and cost in the hybrid cloud.

When the number of processors is very large, a popular routing algorithm works as follows: select two servers at random and route an arriving task to the least loaded of the two. It is well-known that this algorithm dramatically reduces queueing delays compared to an algorithm which routes to a single randomly selected server. In recent cloud computing applications, it has been observed that even sampling two queues per arriving task can be expensive and can even increase delays due to messaging overhead. So there is an interest in reducing the number of sampled queues per arriving task. In this paper, we show that the number of sampled queues can be dramatically reduced by using the fact that tasks arrive in batches (called jobs). In particular, we sample a subset of the queues such that the size of the subset is slightly larger than the batch size (thus, on average, we only sample slightly more than one queue per task). Once a random subset of the queues is sampled, we propose a new load balancing method called batch-filling to attempt to equalize the load among the sampled servers. We show that our algorithm dramatically reduces the sample complexity compared to previously proposed algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218487/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385218","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The power of slightly more than one sample in randomized load balancing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The power of slightly more than one sample in randomized load balancing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1131ying.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051547S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7218502,"authors":[{"name":"Jiasi Chen","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ"],"firstName":"Jiasi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085695098"},{"name":"Mung Chiang","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ"],"firstName":"Mung","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37085621166"},{"name":"Jeffrey Erman","affiliation":["AT&T Labs Bedminster, NJ"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Erman","id":"37297476200"},{"name":"Guangzhi Li","affiliation":["AT&T Labs Bedminster, NJ"],"firstName":"Guangzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085684035"},{"name":"K.K.

Cellular operators still seek methods of performing optimal resource allocation in eMBMS based on a complete understanding of the complex interactions among a number of mechanisms: the multicast coding scheme, the resources allocated to unicast users and their scheduling at the base stations, the resources allocated to a multicast group to satisfy the user experience of its members, and the number of groups and their membership, all of which we consider in this work. We determine the optimal allocation of wireless resources for users to maximize proportional fair utility. To handle the heterogeneity of user channel conditions, we efficiently and optimally partition multicast users into groups so that users with good signal strength do not suffer by being grouped together with users of poor signal strength. Numerical simulations are performed to compare our scheme to practical heuristics and state-of-the-art schemes. We demonstrate the tradeoff between improving unicast user rates and improving spectrum efficiency through multicast. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the globally fair solution and individual user's desire to maximize its rate. We show that even if the user deviates from the global solution in a number of scenarios, we can bound the number of selfish users that will choose to deviate.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218502","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218502.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair and optimal resource allocation for LTE multicast (eMBMS): Group partitioning and dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fair and optimal resource allocation for LTE multicast (eMBMS): Group partitioning and dynamics","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218502/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385182","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218502/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair and optimal resource allocation for LTE multicast (eMBMS): Group partitioning and dynamics","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1266chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090778S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218503,"authors":[{"name":"Hamzeh Beyranvand","affiliation":["Optical Zeitgeist Laboratory, INRS, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada","Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Teheran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamzeh","lastName":"Beyranvand","id":"37644353900"},{"name":"Martin L\u00e9vesque","affiliation":["Optical Zeitgeist Laboratory, INRS, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada","School of Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"L\u00e9vesque","id":"38537383400"},{"name":"Martin Maier","affiliation":["SMARTECH Department, CTTC, Castelldefels, Spain","Optical Zeitgeist Laboratory, INRS, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Maier","id":"37085374802"},{"name":"Jawad A.

In particular, with only persistent flows, it does not matter for throughput optimality whether one uses queue lengths or HoL ages as weights. In this paper, we show the following interesting result: when some flows in the network are dynamic (i.e., they arrive and depart from the network and are not persistent), then HoL-age-based scheduling algorithms are throughput-optimal while it has previously been shown that queue-length-based algorithms are not. This reveals that, age-based algorithms are universal in the sense that their throughput optimality does not depend on whether the arriving traffic is persistent or not. We also present a distributed implementation of the proposed age-based algorithm using CSMA techniques, where each flow only knows its own age and carrier sensing information. Finally, we support our analytical results through simulations. The proof of throughput optimality may be interesting in its own right: it uses a novel Lyapunov function which is the sum of the ages of all the packets in the network.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218506","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"1302","endPage":"1310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the universality of age-based scheduling in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the universality of age-based scheduling in wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218506/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385331","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218506/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the universality of age-based scheduling in wireless networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1302li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105702S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218511,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Cohen","affiliation":["Empow"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37267919400"},{"name":"Liane Lewin-Eytan","affiliation":["Yahoo Labs, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Liane","lastName":"Lewin-Eytan","id":"38273579300"},{"name":"Joseph Seffi Naor","affiliation":["Computer Science Dept, Technion"],"firstName":"Joseph Seffi","lastName":"Naor","id":"37281543600"},{"name":"Danny Raz","affiliation":["Bell Labs Israel and Technion"],"firstName":"Danny","lastName":"Raz","id":"37266858600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218511","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":299,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3647},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bismuth","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Servers","Conferences","Computers","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer networks","graph theory","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near optimal placement","virtual network functions","network function virtualization","NFV","networking paradigm","commodity servers","cloud nodes","software defined mechanism","networking evolution","economical network services","NFV location problem","distance cost","setup cost","approximation factor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218511","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218511.pdf","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218511","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near optimal placement of virtual network functions","abstract":"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a new networking paradigm where network functions are executed on commodity servers located in small cloud nodes distributed across the network, and where software defined mechanisms are used to control the network flows. This paradigm is a major turning point in the evolution of networking, as it introduces high expectations for enhanced economical network services, as well as major technical challenges. In this paper, we address one of the main technical challenges in this domain: the actual placement of the virtual functions within the physical network. This placement has a critical impact on the performance of the network, as well as on its reliability and operation cost. We perform a thorough study of the NFV location problem, show that it introduces a new type of optimization problems, and provide near optimal approximation algorithms guaranteeing a placement with theoretically proven performance. The performance of the solution is evaluated with respect to two measures: the distance cost between the clients and the virtual functions by which they are served, as well as the setup costs of these functions. We provide bi-criteria solutions reaching constant approximation factors with respect to the overall performance, and adhering to the capacity constraints of the networking infrastructure by a constant factor as well.

Our results show that WiGest detects the basic primitives with an accuracy of 87.5% using a single AP only, including through-the-wall non-line-of-sight scenarios. This accuracy increases to 96% using three overheard APs. In addition, when evaluating the system using a multi-media player application, we achieve a classification accuracy of 96%.

These protocols however have no specific mechanism for multicasting. Existing systems hence simply allow a single multicast transmission, as a result underutilizing the AP's multiple antennas. Even worse, in most of systems, multicast is by default sent at the base rate, wasting a considerable link margin available for delivering extra information. To address this inefficiency, we present the design and implementation of HybridCast, a MU-MIMO system that enables joint unicast and multicast. HybridCast efficiently leverages the unused MIMO capability and link margin to send unicast streams concurrently with a multicast session, while ensuring not to harm the achievable rate of multicasting. We evaluate the performance of HybridCast via both testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that HybridCast always outperforms single multicast transmission. The average throughput gain for 4-antenna AP scenarios is 6.22\u00d7 and 1.54\u00d7 when multicast is sent at the base rate and the best rate of the bottleneck receiver, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218553.pdf","startPage":"1724","endPage":"1732","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HybridCast: Joint multicast-unicast design for multiuser MIMO networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unicast","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multicast communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HybridCast","joint multicast-unicast design","multiuser MIMO networks","MU-MIMO system","wireless standards","LTE-Advance","access point","AP multiple antennas","multiple unicast streams","multicast transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"HybridCast: Joint multicast-unicast design for multiuser MIMO networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218553/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385125","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HybridCast: Joint multicast-unicast design for multiuser MIMO networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1724wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075728S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218554,"authors":[{"name":"Diep N.

However, it has been recently reported that the network throughput gain of FD radios over half-duplex (HD) ones is unexpectedly marginal or even negative. This is because both ends of each link transmit at the same time, a set of concurrent FD links will experience more network interference (hence, reduction in the spatial reuse). This article identifies the unique advantages of FD radios and leverage multi-input multioutput (MIMO) communications to translate the FD spectral efficiency gain at the PHY level to throughput and power efficiency gain at the network layer. To that end, we first study the power minimization problem subject to rate demands in a FD-MIMO network. Sufficient conditions under which the FD network throughput can asymptotically double that of an HD network are then established. These conditions also guarantee the existence of a unique Nash Equilibrium that the game quickly converges to. By capturing \u201cspatial signatures\u201d of other radios, a FD-MIMO radio can instantly adjust its ongoing radiation pattern to avoid interfering with the reception directions at other radios. We exploit that to develop a novel MAC protocol that allows multiple FD links to concurrently communicate while adapting their radiation patterns to minimize network interference. The protocol does not require any feedback or coordination among nodes, but relies on the network interference perceived by these FD radios. Extensive simulations show that the proposed MAC design dramatically outperforms traditional FD-based CSMA protocols and HD radios w.r.t. both throughput and energy efficiency. A centralized algorithm for the FD network-wide transmit power minimization problem is also developed. Simulations show that, the proposed MAC protocol on average achieves almost the same power efficiency as the centralized algorithm. Interestingly, we even observe cases when the proposed distributed algorithm outperforms the centralized approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Be responsible: A novel communications scheme for full-duplex MIMO radios","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218554","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218554.pdf","startPage":"1733","endPage":"1741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Be responsible: A novel communications scheme for full-duplex MIMO radios","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218554/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385388","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Be responsible: A novel communications scheme for full-duplex MIMO radios","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1733nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068999S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218555,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Abari","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Abari","id":"38469776900"},{"name":"Hariharan Rahul","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Hariharan","lastName":"Rahul","id":"37449219400"},{"name":"Dina Katabi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Dina","lastName":"Katabi","id":"37283723000"},{"name":"Mondira Pant","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Mondira","lastName":"Pant","id":"37445431400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218555","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":762},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218555","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Wireless communication","Phase locked loops","Wireless sensor networks","Protocols","MIMO","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","MIMO communication","protocols","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["seamless distributed coherent transmission","high-gain communication protocol","frequency offset","reference clock","shared clock","USRP software radio network node","AirShare versatility","distributed MIMO","cooperative protocol"]}],"abstract":"Distributed coherent transmission is necessary for a variety of high-gain communication protocols such as distributed MIMO and creating codes over the air. Unfortunately, however, distributed coherent transmission is intrinsically difficult because different nodes are driven by independent clocks, which do not have the exact same frequency. This causes the nodes to have frequency offsets relative to each other, and hence their transmissions fail to combine coherently over the air. This paper presents AirShare, a primitive that makes distributed coherent transmission seamless. AirShare transmits a shared clock on the air and feeds it to the wireless nodes as a reference clock, hence eliminating the root cause for incoherent transmissions. The paper addresses the challenges in designing and delivering such a shared clock. It also implements AirShare in a network of USRP software radios, and demonstrates that it achieves tight phase coherence. Further, to illustrate AirShare's versatility, the paper uses it to deliver a coherent-radio abstraction on top of which it demonstrates two cooperative protocols: distributed MIMO, and distributed rate adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218555","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218555.pdf","startPage":"1742","endPage":"1750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AirShare: Distributed coherent transmission made seamless","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"AirShare: Distributed coherent transmission made seamless","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218555/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385271","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218555/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AirShare: Distributed coherent transmission made seamless","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1742abari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07104S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7218556,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad A.

While self-interference cancellation is fundamental in realizing full duplex (FD) capability, the more challenging problem in a network-wide deployment of FD communication is a new form of uplink-downlink interference, namely UDI, caused by transmission of uplink clients on the downlink reception of other clients operating in the same frequency band during FD. We leverage spatial interference alignment (IA) as an effective approach to address UDI and characterize the scalability of the FD's multiplexing gain (in terms of M) by providing a closed-form expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of FD's multiplexing gain in a multi-cell network. We also provide an IA construction that can achieve the best scaling possible.

It is of interest to find optimal assignments of tasks to local and remote devices that can take into account the application-specific profile, availability of computational resources, and link connectivity, and find a balance between energy consumption costs of mobile devices and latency for delay-sensitive applications. Given an application described by a task dependency graph, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the latency while meeting prescribed resource utilization constraints. Different from most of existing works that either rely on an integer linear programming formulation, which is NP-hard and not applicable to general task dependency graph for latency metrics, or on intuitively derived heuristics that offer no theoretical performance guarantees, we propose Hermes, a novel fully polynomial time problem approximation scheme (FPTAS) algorithm to solve this problem.

Existing missing tag detection protocols require the tag population to contain only those tags whose IDs are already known to the reader. However, in reality, tag populations often contain tags with unknown IDs, called unexpected tags, and cause unexpected false positives i.e., due to them, missing tags are detected as present. We take the first step towards addressing the problem of detecting the missing tags from a population that contains unexpected tags. Our protocol, RUN, mitigates the adverse effects of unexpected false positives by executing multiple frames with different seeds. It minimizes the missing tag detection time by first estimating the number of unexpected tags and then using it along with the false positive probability to obtain optimal frame sizes and number of times Aloha frames should be executed. RUN works with multiple readers with overlapping regions. It is easy to deploy because it is implemented on readers as a software module and does not require modifications to tags or to the communication protocol between tags and readers. We implemented RUN along with four major missing tag detection protocols and the fastest tag ID collection protocol and compared them side-by-side. Our experimental results show that RUN always achieves the required reliability whereas the best existing protocol achieves a maximum reliability of only 67%.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218577","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218577.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"1939","endPage":"1947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expecting the unexpected: Fast and reliable detection of missing RFID tags in the wild","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Expecting the unexpected: Fast and reliable detection of missing RFID tags in the wild","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218577/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385257","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218577/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expecting the unexpected: Fast and reliable detection of missing RFID tags in the wild","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1939shahzad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06017S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218581,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Liang Shen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, P.

However, since the aggregate capacity of MU-MIMO heavily depends on the channel correlations among the mobile users in a beamforming group, unwisely selecting beamforming groups may result in reduced overall capacity, instead of increasing it. How to select users into a beamforming group becomes the bottleneck of realizing the MU-MIMO gain. The fundamental challenge for user selection is the large searching space, and hence there exists a tradeoff between search complexity and achievable capacity. Previous works have proposed several low complexity heuristic algorithms, but they suffer a significant capacity loss. In this paper, we present a novel MU-MIMO MAC, called SIEVE. The core of SIEVE design is its scalable multi-user selection module that provides a knob to control the aggressiveness in searching the best beamforming group. SIEVE maintains a central database to track the channel and the coherence time for each mobile user, and largely avoids unnecessary computing with a progressive update strategy. Our evaluation, via both small-scale testbed experiments and large-scale trace-driven simulations, shows that SIEVE can achieve around 90% of the capacity compared to exhaustive search.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218581","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218581.pdf","startPage":"1975","endPage":"1983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIEVE: Scalable user grouping for large MU-MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218581/","displayDocTitle":"SIEVE: Scalable user grouping for large MU-MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15400935","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218581/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIEVE: Scalable user grouping for large MU-MIMO systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p1975shen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080336S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7218588,"authors":[{"name":"Chenshu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Chenshu","lastName":"Wu","id":"38238401700"},{"name":"Zheng Yang","affiliation":["School of Software and TNList, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085340976"},{"name":"Zimu Zhou","affiliation":["CSE, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology"],"firstName":"Zimu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37071869200"},{"name":"Kun Qian","affiliation":["School of Software and TNList, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085681652"},{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["School of Software and TNList, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Yunhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279413400"},{"name":"Mingyan Liu","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275671500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218588","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1863},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218588","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Antennas","Antenna measurements","Phase measurement","Real-time systems","Feature extraction","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","diversity reception","mobile computing","OFDM modulation","radiowave propagation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PhaseU","real-time LOS identification scheme","WiFi technology","mobile computing applications","adaptive communication","fine-grained localization","gesture recognition","line-of-sight signal propagation","commodity WiFi devices","PHY layer information","space diversity","antenna elements","frequency diversity","OFDM subcarriers","overall LOS detection rate","overall NLOS detection rate","millisecond-level delay"]}],"abstract":"WiFi technology has fostered numerous mobile computing applications, such as adaptive communication, finegrained localization, gesture recognition, etc., which often achieve better performance or rely on the availability of Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal propagation. Thus the awareness of LOS and Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) plays as a key enabler for them. Realtime LOS identification on commodity WiFi devices, however, is challenging due to limited bandwidth of WiFi and resulting coarse multipath resolution. In this work, we explore and exploit the phase feature of PHY layer information, harnessing both space diversity with antenna elements and frequency diversity with OFDM subcarriers. On this basis, we propose PhaseU, a real-time LOS identification scheme that works in both static and mobile scenarios on commodity WiFi infrastructure. Experimental results in various indoor scenarios demonstrate that PhaseU consistently outperforms previous approaches, achieving overall LOS and NLOS detection rates of 94.35% and 94.19% in static cases and both higher than 80% in mobile contexts. Furthermore, PhaseU achieves real-time capability with millisecond-level delay for a connected AP and 1-second delay for unconnected APs, which is far beyond existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218588","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218588.pdf","startPage":"2038","endPage":"2046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PhaseU: Real-time LOS identification with WiFi","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"PhaseU: Real-time LOS identification with WiFi","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218588/","accessionNumber":"15385285","publicationDate":"April 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PhaseU: Real-time LOS identification with WiFi","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2038wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078179S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7218593,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawei Yuan","affiliation":["Department of CS, University of Arkansas at Little Rock"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37072122700"},{"name":"Shucheng Yu","affiliation":["Department of CS, University of Arkansas at Little Rock"],"firstName":"Shucheng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37310268900"},{"name":"Linke Guo","affiliation":["Department of ECE, The State University of New York"],"firstName":"Linke","lastName":"Guo","id":"38236725100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218593","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":769},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Accuracy","Access control","Servers","Cloud computing","Encryption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","Big Data","cloud computing","computer centres","cryptography","data privacy","image retrieval","polynomials","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEISA","secure image search scheme","efficient encrypted image search","search access control","image search engines","big data","data centers","public clouds","economic choice","privacy concerns","search accuracy","search efficiency","polynomial based design","secure k-means outsourcing algorithm","Amazon EC2 cloud"]}],"abstract":"Image search has been widely deployed in many applications for the rich content that images contain. In the era of big data, image search engines have to be hosted in data centers. As a viable solution, outsourcing the image search to public clouds is an economic choice for many small organizations. However, as many images contain sensitive information, e.g., healthcare information and personal faces/locations, directly outsourcing image search services to public clouds obviously raises privacy concerns. With this observation, several attempts are made towards secure image search over encrypted dataset, but they are limited by either search accuracy or search efficiency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight secure image search scheme over encrypted data, namely SEISA. Compared with image search techniques over plaintexts, SEISA only increases about 9% search cost and sacrifices about 3% on search accuracy. SEISA also efficiently supports search access control by employing a novel polynomial based design, which enables data owners to define who can search a specific image. Furthermore, we design a secure k-means outsourcing algorithm that significantly saves the data owner's cost. To demonstrate SEISA's performance, we implement a prototype of SEISA on Amazon EC2 cloud over a dataset with 10 million images.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218593","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEISA: Secure and efficient encrypted image search with access control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SEISA: Secure and efficient encrypted image search with access control","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218593/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385247","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218593/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEISA: Secure and efficient encrypted image search with access control","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2083yuan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083671S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218596,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhai Sun","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Wenhai","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085453164"},{"name":"Xuefeng Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599942200"},{"name":"Wenjing Lou","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Lou","id":"37275345500"},{"name":"Y.

In most existing schemes, search result is returned by a semi-trusted server and usually considered authentic. However, in practice, the server may malfunction or even be malicious itself. Therefore, users need a result verification mechanism to detect the potential misbehavior in this computation outsourcing model and rebuild their confidence in the whole search process. On the other hand, cloud typically hosts large outsourced data of users in its storage. The verification cost should be efficient enough for practical use, i.e., it only depends on the corresponding search operation, regardless of the file collection size. In this paper, we are among the first to investigate the efficient search result verification problem and propose an encrypted data search scheme that enables users to conduct secure conjunctive keyword search, update the outsourced file collection and verify the authenticity of the search result efficiently. The proposed verification mechanism is efficient and flexible, which can be either delegated to a public trusted authority (TA) or be executed privately by data users. We formally prove the universally composable (UC) security of our scheme. Experimental result shows its practical efficiency even with a large dataset.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218596","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218596.pdf","startPage":"2110","endPage":"2118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218596/","displayDocTitle":"Catch you if you lie to me: Efficient verifiable conjunctive keyword search over large dynamic encrypted cloud data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218596/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Catch you if you lie to me: Efficient verifiable conjunctive keyword search over large dynamic encrypted cloud data","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2110sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083303S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7218599,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Kong","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Kong"},{"name":"Zengwen Yuan","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Zengwen","lastName":"Yuan"},{"name":"Xushen Han","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Xushen","lastName":"Han"},{"name":"Feng Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Xinbing Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China","School of Electronic, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Xinbing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375300"},{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["School of EECS, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38541263100"},{"name":"Songwu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Songwu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280072500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218599","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"abstract":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology has become an efficient way to improve the capacity and reliability of wireless networks. Traditional MIMO schemes are designed mainly for the scenario of contiguous spectrum ranges. However, in cognitive radio networks, the available spectrum is discontiguous, making traditional MIMO schemes inefficient for spectrum usage. This motivates the design of new MIMO schemes that apply to networks with discontiguous spectrum ranges. In this paper, we propose a scheme called VSMC MIMO, which enables MIMO nodes to transmit variable numbers of streams in multiple discontinuous spectrum ranges. This scheme can largely improve the spectrum utilization and meanwhile maintain the same spatial multiplexing and diversity gains as traditional MIMO schemes. To implement this spectral-efficient scheme on cooperative MIMO relays in cognitive radio networks, we propose a joint relay selection and spectrum allocation algorithm and a corresponding MAC protocol for the system. We also build a testbed by the Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) to evaluate the performances of the proposed scheme in practical networks. The experimental results show that VSMC MIMO can efficiently utilize the discontiguous spectrum and greatly improve the throughput of cognitive radio networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218599.pdf","startPage":"2137","endPage":"2145","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VSMC MIMO: A spectral efficient scheme for cooperative relay in cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Resource management","Receivers","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)","software radio","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VSMC MIMO scheme","spectral efficient scheme","cooperative relay","cognitive radio network","multiple input multiple output technology","wireless network reliability","contiguous spectrum range","multiple discontiguous spectrum range","spectrum utilization","spatial multiplexing","diversity gain","joint relay selection and spectrum allocation algorithm","MAC protocol","universal software radio peripheral","USRP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"VSMC MIMO: A spectral efficient scheme for cooperative relay in cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218599/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385316","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VSMC MIMO: A spectral efficient scheme for cooperative relay in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2137kong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092048S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218601,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cloud","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Cloud","id":"38234322500"},{"name":"Douglas Leith","affiliation":["Trinity College, School of Computer Science and Statistics, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Leith","id":"37085553052"},{"name":"Muriel M\u00e9dard","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"M\u00e9dard","id":"37268947300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218601","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218601","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Encoding","Redundancy","Servers","Conferences","Computers","Automatic repeat request"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","encoding","protocols","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","ARQ","transport layer protocols","application layer","streaming services","coded generalization","in-order delivery delay"]}],"abstract":"Reducing the in-order delivery, or playback, delay of reliable transport layer protocols over error prone networks can significantly improve application layer performance.

In particular, we ask how mobile users can be optimally selected in order to generate the required space-time paths across the network for collecting data from a set of fixed locations. The users hold different roles in these paths, from collecting data with their sensing-enabled devices to relaying them across the network and uploading them to data collection points with Internet connectivity. We first consider scenarios with deterministic node mobility and formulate the selection of users as a minimum-cost set cover problem with a submodular objective function. We then generalize to more realistic settings with uncertainty about the user mobility. A methodology is devised for translating the statistics of individual user mobility to statistics of spacetime path formation and feeding them to the set cover problem formulation. We describe practical greedy heuristics for the resulting NP-hard problems and compute their approximation ratios. Our experimentation with real mobility datasets (a) illustrates the multiple tradeoffs between the campaign cost and duration, the bound on the hopcount of space-time paths, and the number of collection points; and (b) provides evidence that in realistic problem instances the heuristics perform much better than what their pessimistic worst-case bounds suggest.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218612","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2262","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218612.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User recruitment for mobile crowdsensing over opportunistic networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218612/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"User recruitment for mobile crowdsensing over opportunistic networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15385310","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218612/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User recruitment for mobile crowdsensing over opportunistic networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2254karaliopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049853S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7218628,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38666347100"},{"name":"Zhenfu Cao","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Lab for Trustworthy Computing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhenfu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085376411"},{"name":"Xiaolei Dong","affiliation":["East China Normal University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Dong"},{"name":"Xiaodong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37289264200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218628","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":990},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Encryption","Cloud computing","Privacy","Access control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","digital signatures","health care","medical information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TR-MABE encryption","white-box traceable revocable multiauthority attribute-based encryption","multilevel privacy-preserving e-healthcare","e-healthcare cloud computing systems","electronic health care","cloud-assisted e-healthcare systems","personal health information","PHI","medical treatment","security issue","privacy issue","patient treatment","patient identity","medical consultation","medical research","patients conditional identity privacy","group signatures","formal security proof"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing system","attribute-based encryption","multi-authority","traceability and revocability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218628","abstract":"Cloud-assisted e-healthcare systems significantly facilitate the patients to outsource their personal health information (PHI) for medical treatment of high quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, a series of unaddressed security and privacy issues dramatically impede its practicability and popularity. In e-healthcare systems, it is expected that only the primary physicians responsible for the patients treatment can not only access the PHI content but verify the real identity of the patient. Secondary physicians participating in medical consultation and/or research tasks, however, are only permitted to view or use the content of the protected PHI, while unauthorized entities cannot obtain anything. Existing work mainly focuses on patients conditional identity privacy by exploiting group signatures, which are very computationally costly. In this paper, we propose a white-box traceable and revocable multi-authority attribute-based encryption named TR-MABE to efficiently achieve multilevel privacy preservation without introducing additional special signatures. It can efficiently prevent secondary physicians from knowing the patients identity. Also, it can efficiently track the physicians who leak secret keys used to protect patients identity and PHI. Finally, formal security proof and extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our proposed TR-MABE in e-healthcare cloud computing systems.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218628","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218628.pdf","startPage":"2398","endPage":"2406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TR-MABE: White-box traceable and revocable multi-authority attribute-based encryption and its applications to multi-level privacy-preserving e-healthcare cloud computing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"TR-MABE: White-box traceable and revocable multi-authority attribute-based encryption and its applications to multi-level privacy-preserving e-healthcare cloud computing systems","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218628/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385198","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TR-MABE: White-box traceable and revocable multi-authority attribute-based encryption and its applications to multi-level privacy-preserving e-healthcare cloud computing systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2398zhou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088805S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7218630,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Nitsche","affiliation":["Univ.

Unfortunately, establishing communication with sufficiently narrow beamwidth to obtain the necessary link budget is a high overhead procedure in which the search space scales with device mobility and the product of the sender-receiver beam resolution. In this paper, we design, implement, and experimentally evaluate Blind Beam Steering (BBS) a novel architecture and algorithm that removes in-band overhead for directional mm-Wave link establishment. Our system architecture couples mm-Wave and legacy 2.4/5 GHz bands using out-of-band direction inference to establish (overhead-free) multi-Gbps mm-Wave communication. Further, BBS evaluates direction estimates retrieved from passively overheard 2.4/5 GHz frames to assure highest mm-Wave link quality on unobstructed direct paths. By removing in-band overhead, we leverage mm-Wave's very high throughput capabilities, beam-width scalability and provide robustness to mobility. We demonstrate that BBS achieves 97.8% accuracy estimating direction between pairing nodes using at least 5 detection band antennas. Further, BBS successfully detects unobstructed direct path conditions with an accuracy of 96.5% and reduces the IEEE 802.11ad beamforming training overhead by 81%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218630/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15385200","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218630/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Steering with eyes closed: Mm-Wave beam steering without in-band measurement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steering with eyes closed: Mm-Wave beam steering without in-band measurement","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2416nitsche.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063068S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7218631,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangyu Guan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Zhangyu","lastName":"Guan","id":"37712370800"},{"name":"G.

Specifically, we propose lightweight, asynchronous, and distributed algorithms for joint rate control and stochastic channel access designed to maximize the throughput of ultrasonic intra-body area networks under energy constraints. We first develop (and validate through testbed experiments) a statistical model of the ultrasonic channel and of the spatial and temporal variability of ultrasonic interference. Compared to in-air radio frequency (RF), human tissues show a much lower propagation speed, which further causes unaligned interference at the receiver. It is therefore inefficient to perform adaptation based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). Based on this model, we formulate the problem of maximizing the network throughput by jointly controlling the transmission rate and the channel access probability over a finite time horizon based only on a statistical characterization of interference. We then propose a fully distributed solution algorithm, and through both simulation and testbed results, we show that the algorithm achieves considerable throughput gains compared with traditional algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"2425","endPage":"2433","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218631.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic intra-body networking: Interference modeling, stochastic channel access and rate control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218631/","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic intra-body networking: Interference modeling, stochastic channel access and rate control","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385123","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic intra-body networking: Interference modeling, stochastic channel access and rate control","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2425guan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06217S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218632,"authors":[{"name":"Jialiang Zhang","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison & UESTC"],"firstName":"Jialiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085764721"},{"name":"Xinyu Zhang","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310011400"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["UESTC, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218632","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Light emitting diodes","Modulation","Calibration","Transmitters","Gain","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","optical links","software radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive in-frame rate selection","visible light networks","visible light communications","appealing technology","indoor environments","WiFi","VLC software radio","packet duration","WiFi rate adaptation protocols","VLC links","conventional packet-level adaptation schemes"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dancing with light: Predictive in-frame rate selection for visible light networks","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","endPage":"2442","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218632.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218632","startPage":"2434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218632","abstract":"Visible Light Communications (VLC) is emerging as an appealing technology to complement WiFi in indoor environments.

However, in large-scale networks, full-mesh measurement of network performance between all transmission pairs is infeasible. As a newly emerging sparsity representation technique, matrix completion allows the recovery of a low-rank matrix using only a small number of random samples. Existing schemes often fix the number of samples assuming the rank of the matrix is known, while the data features thus the matrix rank vary over time. In this paper, we propose to exploit the matrix completion techniques to derive the end-to-end network performance among all node pairs by only measuring a small subset of end-to-end paths. To address the challenge of rank change in the practical system, we propose a sequential and information-based adaptive sampling scheme, along with a novel sampling stopping condition. Our scheme is based only on the data observed without relying on the reconstruction method or the knowledge on the sparsity of unknown data. We have performed extensive simulations based on real-world trace data, and the results demonstrate that our scheme can significantly reduce the measurement cost while ensuring high accuracy in obtaining the whole network performance data.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218633","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218633.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"2443","endPage":"2451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential and adaptive sampling for matrix completion in network monitoring systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequential and adaptive sampling for matrix completion in network monitoring systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218633/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385256","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218633/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential and adaptive sampling for matrix completion in network monitoring systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2443xie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068785S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218637,"authors":[{"name":"Yutian Wen","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yutian","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085412223"},{"name":"Xiaohua Tian","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China","Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Tian","id":"37537342000"},{"name":"Xinbing Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China","School of Electronic, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Xinbing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375300"},{"name":"Songwu Lu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Songwu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280072500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218637","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1461},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218637","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Accuracy","Probabilistic logic","Databases","Wireless communication","Crowdsourcing","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","indoor communication","probability","RSSI","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization","received signal strength fingerprinting method","general probabilistic model","location estimation reliability","crowdsourcing paradigm"]}],"abstract":"Indoor localization has been an active research field for decades, where the received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting based methodology is widely adopted and induces many important localization techniques such as the recently proposed one building the fingerprint database with crowd-sourcing. While efforts have been dedicated to improve the accuracy and efficiency of localization, the fundamental limits of RSS fingerprinting based methodology itself is still unknown in a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we present a general probabilistic model to shed light on a fundamental question: how good the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization can achieve? Concretely, we present the probability that a user can be localized in a region with certain size, given the RSS fingerprints submitted to the system. We reveal the interaction among the localization accuracy, the reliability of location estimation and the number of measurements in the RSS fingerprinting based location determination. Moreover, we present the optimal fingerprints reporting strategy that can achieve the best accuracy for given reliability and the number of measurements, which provides a design guideline for the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization facilitated by crowdsourcing paradigm.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218637","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218637.pdf","startPage":"2479","endPage":"2487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental limits of RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fundamental limits of RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385142","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218637/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental limits of RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2479wen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066658S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7218640,"authors":[{"name":"Suining He","affiliation":["Department of CSE, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Suining","lastName":"He","id":"37085694225"},{"name":"S.-H.

Such distance information may be spatial (e.g., via inter-node measurement) or temporal (e.g., via dead reckoning). Previous approaches on distance fusion often require exact distance measurement, assume the knowledge of distance distribution, or apply narrowly to some specific sensing technology or scenario. Due to random signal fluctuation, wireless fingerprints are inherently noisy and distance cannot be exactly measured. We hence propose Wi-Dist, a highly accurate indoor localization framework fusing noisy fingerprints with uncertain mutual distances (given by their bounds). Wi-Dist is a generic framework applicable to a wide range of sensors (peer-assisted, INS, etc.) and wireless fingerprints (Wi-Fi, RFID, CSI, etc.). It achieves low errors by a convex-optimization formulation which jointly considers distance bounds and only the first two moments of measured fingerprint signals. We implement Wi-Dist, and conduct extensive simulation and experimental studies based on Wi-Fi in our international airport and university campus. Our results show that Wi-Dist achieves significantly better accuracy than other state-of-the-art schemes (often by more than 40%).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Manganese","Noise measurement","Accuracy","Distance measurement","Sensors","Dead reckoning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airports","educational institutions","optimisation","radiofrequency identification","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor localization","fusing noisy fingerprints","distance bounds","mutual distance information","inter-node measurement","dead reckoning","distance measurement","random signal fluctuation","wireless fingerprints","Wi-Dist","uncertain mutual distances","Wi-Fi","RFID","convex-optimization formulation","international airport","university campus"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor localization","convex optimization","fusion","noisy fingerprint","distance bounds","measurement uncertainty"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218640","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218640","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218640.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218640","startPage":"2506","endPage":"2514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusing noisy fingerprints with distance bounds for indoor localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fusing noisy fingerprints with distance bounds for indoor localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218640/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218640/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385394","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusing noisy fingerprints with distance bounds for indoor localization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2506he.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081032S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7218642,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Chen","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085545620"},{"name":"Cong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085526245"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, The University of Mississippi, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37309004400"},{"name":"Jiangchuan Liu","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Jiangchuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279466900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218642","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":630},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Servers","Cloud computing","Production","Media","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","optimisation","outsourcing","video servers","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowdsourced live streaming","cloud service","video channel","joint optimization","streaming server","geodistributed video crowdsourcer","service migration","Amazon cloud","Microsoft cloud"]}],"abstract":"Empowered by today's rich tools for media generation and distribution, and the convenient Internet access, crowdsourced streaming generalizes the single-source streaming paradigm by including massive contributors for a video channel. It calls a joint optimization along the path from crowdsourcers, through streaming servers, to the end-users to minimize the overall latency. The dynamics of the video sources, together with the globalized request demands and the high computation demand from each sourcer, make crowdsourced live streaming challenging even with powerful support from modern cloud computing. In this paper, we present a generic framework that facilitates a cost-effective cloud service for crowdsourced live streaming. Through adaptively leasing, the cloud servers can be provisioned in a fine granularity to accommodate geo-distributed video crowdsourcers. We present an optimal solution to deal with service migration among cloud instances of diverse lease prices. It also addresses the location impact to the streaming quality.

It has been shown that accurate time can be used for coordinating network-wide updates, thereby reducing temporary inconsistencies. However, this approach presents a great challenge; even if network devices have perfectly synchronized clocks, how can we guarantee that updates are performed at the exact time for which they were scheduled? In this paper we present a practical method for implementing accurate time-based updates, using TIMEFLIPs. A TimeFlip is a time-based update that is implemented using a timestamp field in a Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) entry. TIMEFLIPs can be used to implement Atomic Bundle updates, and to coordinate network updates with high accuracy. We analyze the amount of TCAM resources required to encode a TimeFlip, and show that if there is enough flexibility in determining the scheduled time, a TimeFlip can be encoded by a single TCAM entry, using a single bit to represent the timestamp, and allowing the update to be performed with an accuracy on the order of 1 microsecond.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218645","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218645.pdf","startPage":"2551","endPage":"2559","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TimeFlip: Scheduling network updates with timestamp-based TCAM ranges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"TimeFlip: Scheduling network updates with timestamp-based TCAM ranges","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385325","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218645/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TimeFlip: Scheduling network updates with timestamp-based TCAM ranges","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2551mizrahi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079504S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7218649,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085384264"},{"name":"Richard T.

However, various realizing methods on different graphs could possibly be used in the same OSN, and they may lead to different sampling efficiencies, i.e., asymptotic variances. To utilize multiple statistics for accurate measurements, we formulate a mixture sampling problem, through which we construct a mixture unbiased estimator which minimizes the asymptotic variance. Given fixed sampling budgets for different statistics, we derive the optimal weights to combine the individual estimators; given a fixed total budget, we show that a greedy allocation towards the most efficient statistic is optimal. In practice, the sampling efficiencies of statistics can be quite different for various targets and are unknown before sampling. To solve this problem, we design a two-stage framework which adaptively spends a partial budget to test different statistics and allocates the remaining budget to the inferred best statistic. We show that our two-stage framework is a generalization of 1) randomly choosing a statistic and 2) evenly allocating the total budget among all available statistics, and our adaptive algorithm achieves higher efficiency than these benchmark strategies in theory and experiment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218649/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385306","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling online social networks via heterogeneous statistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling online social networks via heterogeneous statistics","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2587wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074638S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7218658,"authors":[{"name":"Zijiang Hao","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Zijiang","lastName":"Hao","id":"37085712435"},{"name":"Yutao Tang","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Yutao","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085732260"},{"name":"Yifan Zhang","affiliation":["State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085423452"},{"name":"Ed Novak","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ed","lastName":"Novak","id":"37071960100"},{"name":"Nancy Carter","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Carter","id":"37085728124"},{"name":"Qun Li","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Li","id":"37291116600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218658","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Hardware","Virtual machine monitors","Security","Mobile communication","Keyboards","Virtualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data protection","mobile computing","security of data","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure mobile cloud computing platform","smart mobile devices","mobile device operating system","cloud-based virtual machine","backend cloud server","file system extension","user data protection","hardware virtualization technology"]}],"abstract":"Mobile devices are now ubiquitous in the modern world.

We design a file system extension to enable this feature, so users can freely choose to run their applications either in the cloud (for high security guarantees), or on their local mobile device (for better user experience). Second, in order to protect user data on the smart mobile device, we leverage hardware virtualization technology, which isolates the data from the local mobile device operating system.

However, data confidentiality and online computational cost still present practical concerns to the deployment of data sharing in cloud computing for mobile devices. Existing data sharing protocols in cloud computing either cannot support the flexible sharing style for the encrypted data, or suffer from massive online computational cost that scales with the complexity of the access policy. In this paper, to cope with these challenging concerns, we propose a new data sharing protocol for cloud computing by using a new cryptographic primitive named online/offline attribute-based proxy re-encryption and the transform key technique. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed data sharing protocol is the first one featuring with fine-grained access control, flexible sharing, data confidentiality, and minimum online computational cost on the user side at the same time. Furthermore, the proposed online/offline attribute-based proxy re-encryption scheme may be of independent interest. At last, extensive analysis shows that our proposed data sharing protocol is secure in terms of data confidentiality, and suitable for mobile devices in terms of online computational cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385126","htmlLink":"/document/7218659/","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fine-grained data sharing in cloud computing for mobile devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-grained data sharing in cloud computing for mobile devices","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2677shao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083787S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218671,"authors":[{"name":"Qingquan Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qingquan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085690041"},{"name":"Ziqiao Zhou","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ziqiao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085482525"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085486798"},{"name":"Jing Qi","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085688817"},{"name":"Chenxi Guo","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chenxi","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085690693"},{"name":"Ping Yi","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Yi","id":"37085422998"},{"name":"Ting Zhu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085698284"},{"name":"Sheng Xiao","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085693806"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218671","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Target tracking","Accuracy","Interference","Heuristic algorithms","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object tracking","radiofrequency interference","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint-free tracking","dynamic enhanced field division","wireless sensor networks","tracking algorithms","preset fingerprints","interference-free environment","interference-rich environments","fingerprint-free localizing algorithm","EFD algorithm","tracking accuracy"]}],"abstract":"Wireless sensor networks are often deployed for tracking moving objects. Many tracking algorithms have been proposed with two general assumptions: the preset fingerprints(prior landmark or context information) and an interference-free environment. These algorithms, however, cannot be used for on-demand deployment where finger-prints are unavailable and would perform poorly in interference-rich environments. In this paper, we present a fingerprint-free localizing and tracking algorithm, called Enhanced Field Division (EFD). The EFD algorithm is used to dynamically divide the field into areas with unique signatures and tracks the target, without any finger-prints. We also implemented a proof-of-concept localization platform to demonstrate the tracking accuracy and the algorithm performance in practical, interference rich environment.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218671","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218671.pdf","startPage":"2785","endPage":"2793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprint-free tracking with dynamic enhanced field division","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218671/","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint-free tracking with dynamic enhanced field division","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385411","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218671/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint-free tracking with dynamic enhanced field division","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2785zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111194S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7218673,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Gao","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, The Chinese University, Hong Kong, HK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37711086100"},{"name":"Fen Hou","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macau"],"firstName":"Fen","lastName":"Hou","id":"37073286600"},{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, The Chinese University, Hong Kong, HK"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085716930"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218673","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":998},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Stability analysis","Queueing analysis","Mobile communication","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","incentive schemes","Lyapunov methods","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service","sensor placement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-term user participation incentive","data samples","service quality","sensor selection problem","location aware participatory sensing system","time dependent participatory sensing system","Lyapunov-based VCG auction policy","asymptotic convergence","optimal offline benchmark performance"]}],"abstract":"Providing an adequate long-term user participation incentive is important for a participatory sensing system to maintain enough number of active users (sensors), so as to collect a sufficient number of data samples and support a desired level of service quality. In this work, we consider the sensor selection problem in a general time-dependent and location-aware participatory sensing system, taking the long-term user participation incentive into explicit consideration. We study the problem systematically under different information scenarios, regarding both future information and current information (realization). In particular, we propose a Lyapunov-based VCG auction policy for the on-line sensor selection, which converges asymptotically to the optimal off-line benchmark performance, even with no future information and under asymmetry of current information. Extensive numerical results show that our proposed policy outperforms the state-of-art policies in the literature, in terms of both user participation (e.g., reducing the user dropping probability by 25% ~ 90%) and social performance (e.g., increasing the social welfare by 15% ~ 80%).","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218673","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","startPage":"2803","endPage":"2811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing long-term participation incentive in participatory sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Providing long-term participation incentive in participatory sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218673/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385319","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7218673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing long-term participation incentive in participatory sensing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2803gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063473S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7218676,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Zhang","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085483611"},{"name":"Guoliang Xue","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Guoliang","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085376968"},{"name":"Ruozhou Yu","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Ruozhou","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085496043"},{"name":"Dejun Yang","affiliation":["Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO"],"firstName":"Dejun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085487087"},{"name":"Jian Tang","affiliation":["Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37276758700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8381-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"7218676","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1503},"abstract":"With the prosperity of smart devices, crowdsourcing has emerged as a new computing/networking paradigm. Through the crowdsourcing platform, service requesters can buy service from service providers. An important component of crowdsourcing is its incentive mechanism. We study three models of crowdsourcing, which involve cooperation and competition among the service providers. Our simplest model generalizes the well-known user-centric model studied in a recent Mobicom paper. We design an incentive mechanism for each of the three models, and prove that these incentive mechanisms are individually rational, budget-balanced, computationally efficient, and truthful.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172813/7218353/07218676.pdf","startPage":"2830","endPage":"2838","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7218353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7218676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truthful incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crowdsourcing","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Cost accounting","Monopoly","Conferences","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive schemes","outsourcing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mobicom paper","user-centric model","crowdsourcing platform","smart device","truthful incentive mechanism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7218676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Truthful incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7218676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15385265","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truthful incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p2830zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078249S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172813","isNumber":"7218353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172813","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7218353","articleId":"7218676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219365,"authors":[{"name":"Ivaylo Vasilev","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ivaylo","lastName":"Vasilev","id":"37706004600"},{"name":"Buon Kiong Lau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Buon Kiong","lastName":"Lau","id":"37285007500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7219365","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":979},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Multiplexing","Correlation","Prototypes","Absorption","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","impedance matching","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user effect","MIMO handset antenna","theory of characteristic mode","multiple-input-multiple-output antenna","mobile terminal","free-space performance","TCM-based MIMO terminal antenna design","full-wave simulation","multiplexing efficiency","impedance matching","coupling efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impedance matching and mutual coupling","mobile antennas","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems"]}],"abstract":"The Theory of Characteristic Modes (TCM) has been applied to design high-performance multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antennas for mobile terminals. However, existing studies focus on free-space (FS) performance, which is mostly irrelevant in real usage. This letter investigates the performances of two TCM-based MIMO terminal antenna designs in seven realistic user scenarios for frequencies below 1 GHz. Full-wave simulation results indicate that the TCM designs can significantly outperform conventional designs in user scenarios that require good MIMO performance. Higher multiplexing efficiency (ME), by up to 3 dB, was recorded for a TCM design relative to a conventional terminal in a two-hand scenario. Performance advantages of the TCM designs were mainly due to lower correlation as well as higher impedance matching and coupling efficiency. Moreover, a combined usage study based on weighted ME over different user cases established that on average TCM designs outperform conventional designs by up to 1.6 dB. This suggests that the TCM designs not only give superior performance in FS, but also in realistic user scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On User Effects in MIMO Handset Antennas Designed Using Characteristic Modes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2472288","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07219365.pdf","startPage":"758","endPage":"761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2472288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219365/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"On User Effects in MIMO Handset Antennas Designed Using Characteristic Modes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/7219365/","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2016","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15851908","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"VINNOVA","grantNumber":"2009-02969"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsradet","grantNumber":"2010-468"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On User Effects in MIMO Handset Antennas Designed Using Characteristic Modes","sourcePdf":"lawp-vasilev-2472288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054299S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7219365","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219366,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Unlike the existing track-before-detect methods that are based on sequential state updates, this method computes integrated echo energy for the entire hypothesized motion. The detection and the estimation of the track are made simultaneously using the batch processing approach. A comparison of track detection probability shows higher performance against low observable targets. Using a motion similarity metric and motion model homogeneity, a performance prediction model is derived and compared with the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2471935","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07219367.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2471935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"1408","endPage":"1415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Track Detection of Low Observable Targets Using a Motion Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Track Detection of Low Observable Targets Using a Motion Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219367/","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7219367/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15406006","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-10-1-0817"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Track Detection of Low Observable Targets Using a Motion Model","sourcePdf":"access-park-2471935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080135S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7219367","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7219368,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Ilarri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7331734/7219368/ilarr-2472395-small.gif","p":["\n\nSergio Ilarri received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

As a fundamental building block for the development of applications for vehicular networks, new techniques are needed to handle data appropriately in the vehicles. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of data management for vehicular networks, where the vehicle-to-vehicle communications play a key role. We describe the technological context of vehicular networks along with the different types of data managed in that environment, and we analyze several challenges, such as the evaluation of the relevance of data regarding the occurrence of events on the roads (e.g., accidents), the design of appropriate (effective and efficient) content-based data dissemination protocols, the competition in the access to physical resources (e.g., parking spaces), the development of suitable data aggregation techniques specifically adapted to the context of vehicular networks, and query processing. This paper provides an in-depth coverage of data management for vehicular networks but keeps, at the same time, a didactic orientation. Supported by an extensive collection of relevant references, we analyze the state of the art, identify some must-read references, outline research problems, and extract conclusions and lessons learned.","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7331734/07219368.pdf","startPage":"2420","endPage":"2460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2472395","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2472395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219368","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent transportation systems","Vehicular ad hoc networks","Tutorials","Intelligent vehicles","Road vehicles","Query processing","Peer-to-peer computing","Information exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent transportation systems","protocols","query processing","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data management","intelligent transportation systems","vehicular ad hoc networks","vehicle-to-vehicle communications","content-based data dissemination protocols","data aggregation techniques","query processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicular networks","data management","data dissemination","data sharing","data aggregation","query processing","scarce physical resources on the roads"]},{"kwd":["Vehicular networks","data management","data dissemination","data sharing","data aggregation","query processing","scarce physical resources on the roads"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Data Management Perspective on Vehicular Networks","accessionNumber":"15602571","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219368/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CICYT project","grantNumber":"TIN2013-46238-C4-4-R and DGA-FSE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data Management Perspective on Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"comst-ilarri-2472395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.456701S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7331734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7331734","articleId":"7219368","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7219371,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Safety Engineering, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7875385/7219371/zhang-2460747-small.gif","p":["\n\nYin Zhang (M'13) is a faculty member with the School of Information and Safety Engineering, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, Wuhan, China.

To provide a more convenient service and environment of healthcare, this paper proposes a cyber-physical system for patient-centric healthcare applications and services, called Health-CPS, built on cloud and big data analytics technologies. This system consists of a data collection layer with a unified standard, a data management layer for distributed storage and parallel computing, and a data-oriented service layer.

Many nonlinearity mitigation methods have been studied. Recent technology advances in the micro-LED array have provided a simple alternative to deal with the system nonlinearity. In this paper, we study the approach of providing multiple access for the VLC system with the micro-LED array. A code-division multiple-access (CDMA) scheme that enables multiple access with variable data rate is proposed. In addition, the proposed system architecture is immune to the nonlinearity of the micro-LED array, thus providing optimal system performance.

Recently, substantial progress in self-interference (SI) cancelation makes full-duplex (FD) TWR practical. For this new paradigm, analyzing spectral-energy efficiency (SE-EE) tradeoff is crucial, which has not been addressed in the existing works in the literature. In this paper, the SE-EE tradeoff in a FDTW relay network with amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is studied by considering the residual SI at the relay. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EE under the SE requirement and the maximum transmission power constraints by adjusting the transmission power of the terminals and the amplification gain of the relay. A lower complexity iterative optimization algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed algorithm can achieve optimal EE that is consistent to the one obtained by the exclusive searching method; 2) the FDTW relay network can achieve higher SE but lower optimal EE compared with the half-duplex (HD) one; and 3) the optimal EE is insensitive to the residual power of SI, when the relay is located near either terminal.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2464238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8323440/07219383.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2464238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral\u2013Energy Efficiency Tradeoff in Full-Duplex Two-Way Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219383/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral\u2013Energy Efficiency Tradeoff in Full-Duplex Two-Way Relay Networks","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17649964","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219383/","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61162008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004607","fundingName":"Guangxi Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013GXNSFGA019004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005372","fundingName":"Director Fund of Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing (Guilin University of Electronic Technology), Ministry of Education, China","grantNumber":"2013ZR02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral\u2013Energy Efficiency Tradeoff in Full-Duplex Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-chen-2464238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088232S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8323440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8323440","articleId":"7219383","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219387,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Hsiung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7558256/7219387/lin-2472118-small.gif","p":["Chien-Hsiung Lin received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in information management from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), Taipei, Taiwan, in 2003, 2005, and 2011, respectively.","He is a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, NTUST.

Due to only one primary color measured at each pixel location, the captured videos are usually referred to as the mosaic videos. For the purposes of economical storage and transmission, it is very important to achieve a good tradeoff between the quality and bitrate when compressing mosaic videos with different RGB-CFA structures. In this paper, based on mathematical optimization technique, a novel chroma subsampling strategy is presented for compressing mosaic videos with arbitrary RGB-CFA structures in H.264/AVC and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). For each 2 \u00d7 2 YUV block to be subsampled with 4:2:0 format, the proposed strategy determines the proper sampled U and V components by minimizing, prior to compression, the quality distortion between the original colocated mosaic block and the mosaic block conversed from the current subsampled YUV block. Through the mathematical optimization formulated in the proposed strategy, the significance of the sampled U and V components for reconstructing R, G, and B pixels can be simultaneously taken into consideration. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed chroma subsampling strategy has the best quality and bitrate tradeoff at a similar execution time requirement for compressing mosaic videos with arbitrary RGB-CFA structures in H.264/AVC and HEVC compared with the state-of-the-art ones by Chen et al. and Yang et al. as well as the three commonly used ones.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7558256/07219387.pdf","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2472118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2472118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Chroma Subsampling Strategy Based on Mathematical Optimization for Compressing Mosaic Videos With Arbitrary RGB Color Filter Arrays in H.264/AVC and HEVC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Image color analysis","Video coding","Image reconstruction","Optimization","Distortion","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image colour analysis","image filtering","image sampling","optimisation","video cameras","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["B pixels","G pixels","R pixels","mosaic block","quality distortion","YUV block","mathematical optimization technique","economical storage","pixel location","primary color","RGB-CFA structures","red-green- blue color filter array","single-sensor technology","color digital video cameras","HEVC","High Efficiency Video Coding","H.264-AVC","compressing mosaic videos","chroma subsampling strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arbitrary red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB) color filter arrays (CFAs)","Bj\u00f8ntegaard delta peak signal-to-noise ratio (BD-PSNR)","chroma subsampling","H.264/AVC","High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","mathematical optimization","mosaic videos"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Novel Chroma Subsampling Strategy Based on Mathematical Optimization for Compressing Mosaic Videos With Arbitrary RGB Color Filter Arrays in H.264/AVC and HEVC","volume":"26","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7219387/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16283098","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 101-2221-E-011-139-MY3 and MOST 102-2221-E-011-055-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Chroma Subsampling Strategy Based on Mathematical Optimization for Compressing Mosaic Videos With Arbitrary RGB Color Filter Arrays in H.264/AVC and HEVC","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lin-2472118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134725S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7558256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7558256","articleId":"7219387","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219388,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek K.

It solves one of the most limiting factors of existing clock schemes, the implementation of feedback paths and easy routing of QCA-based circuits. Consequently, USE facilitates considerably the development of standard cell libraries and design tools for this technology, besides avoiding thermodynamics problems. Case studies presented in this paper reveal an area reduction of up to factor 5 and delay decrease by up to factor 3 in comparison with an existing advanced clocking scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7419205/07219390.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2471996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2471996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"USE: A Universal, Scalable, and Efficient Clocking Scheme for QCA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Computer architecture","Quantum dots","Microprocessors","Automata","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","quantum dots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard cell libraries","manufacturable clocking scheme","remarkable low-power characteristics","impressive switching frequency","exceptional integration density","CMOS circuits","QCA-based circuits","quantum dot cellular automata","USE","universal-scalable-efficient clocking scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata,","Clock Zones","Clock Generator","Feedback and Routing"]},{"kwd":["Clock generator","clock zones","feedback and routing","quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"USE: A Universal, Scalable, and Efficient Clocking Scheme for QCA","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7219390/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15802943","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004901","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo\u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"USE: A Universal, Scalable, and Efficient Clocking Scheme for QCA","sourcePdf":"tcad-vilelaneto-2471996-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049713S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7419205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7419205","articleId":"7219390","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7219391,"authors":[{"name":"Lechang Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Lechang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539369000"},{"name":"Ramesh Pokharel","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Pokharel","id":"37282776300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"7219391","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1140},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219391","abstract":"Compact modeling of phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer is proposed to reduce transient phase noise and jitter simulation time.

In fact, in modern wireless standards such as LTE and LTE-A, the HARQ buffer size is one of the main drivers of the modem area and power consumption. This has recently highlighted the importance of HARQ buffer management, that is, of the use of buffer-aware transmission schemes and of advanced compression policies for the storage of received data. This work investigates HARQ buffer management by leveraging information-theoretic achievability arguments based on random coding. Specifically, standard HARQ schemes, namely Type-I, Chase Combining, and Incremental Redundancy, are first studied under the assumption of a finite-capacity HARQ buffer by considering both coded modulation, via Gaussian signaling, and Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM). The analysis sheds light on the impact of different compression strategies, namely the conventional compression log-likelihood ratios and the direct digitization of baseband signals, on the throughput. The optimization of coding blocklength is also investigated, highlighting the benefits of HARQ buffer-aware transmission scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

We focus on randomized cooperative policies, whereby the secondary user (SU) serves either its own queue or the primary users (PU) relayed packets queue with certain service probability. The proposed policy opens room for trading the PU delay for enhanced SU delay, and vice versa, depending on the application QoS requirements. Towards this objective, the system's stable throughput region is characterized. Furthermore, the moment generating function approach is employed and generalized for our system to derive closed-form expressions for the average packet delay for both users. The accuracy of these expressions is validated through simulations. Analytical and simulation results reveal that the service probability can steer the system into prioritizing PU's traffic at the expense of SU's QoS, or vice versa, independently from the admission probability. Alternatively, the ability of the admission probability to control the throughput and delay at the PU or the SU depends on the selected value for the service probability as well as the channel conditions. Finally, it is shown how the service and admission probabilities could be used to achieve the desired QoS level to both PU and SU.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","volume":"63","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15676763","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219395/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Networks With Probabilistic Relaying: Stable Throughput and Delay Tradeoffs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"NPRP 4-1034-2-385"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Networks With Probabilistic Relaying: Stable Throughput and Delay Tradeoffs","sourcePdf":"tcomm-mohamed-2472008-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104439S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7219395","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7219398,"authors":[{"name":"B.

control (ADRC) is now considered as a powerful control strategy in dealing with large uncertainty covering unknown dynamics, external disturbance, and unknown part in coefficient of the control. However, all theoretical works up to present are limited to deterministic uncertainty. In this technical note, we generalize the ADRC to uncertain nonlinear systems subject to external bounded stochastic disturbance described by an uncertain stochastic differential equation driven by white noise. We first design an extended state observer (ESO) that is used to estimate both state, and total disturbance which includes the internal uncertain nonlinear part and the external uncertain stochastic disturbance. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop system is practically stable in the mean-square topology. The numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2015.2471815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/7478173/07219403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2015.2471815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7478173","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Disturbance Rejection Control Approach to Output-Feedback Stabilization of a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems Subject to Stochastic Disturbance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active Disturbance Rejection Control Approach to Output-Feedback Stabilization of a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems Subject to Stochastic Disturbance","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16023277","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7219403/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"(2011CB808002)"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of South Africa"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Disturbance Rejection Control Approach to Output-Feedback Stabilization of a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems Subject to Stochastic Disturbance","sourcePdf":"tac-guo-2471815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088888S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7478173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7478173","articleId":"7219403","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219408,"authors":[{"name":"Chanyong Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Chanyong","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37085700521"},{"name":"Jeong Woo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292745300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7219408","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"A spatial modulation (SM) scheme based on multi-strata space-time coding (MSSTC), called MSSTC-SM, is proposed.

Opinion dynamics in social groups, however, require beyond these conventional models due to ubiquitous competition and distrust between some pairs of agents, which are usually characterized by repulsive couplings and may lead to clustering of the opinions. A simple yet insightful model of opinion dynamics with both attractive and repulsive couplings was proposed recently by C. Altafini, who examined first-order consensus algorithms over static signed graphs. This protocol establishes modulus consensus, where the opinions become the same in modulus but may differ in signs. In this paper, we extend the modulus consensus model to the case where the network topology is an arbitrary time-varying signed graph and prove reaching modulus consensus under mild sufficient conditions of uniform connectivity of the graph. For cut-balanced graphs, not only sufficient, but also necessary conditions for modulus consensus are given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","volume":"61","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16023251","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7219413/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Opinion Dynamics in Social Networks With Hostile Camps: Consensus vs. Polarization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"ERCStG-307207"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004285","fundingName":"St. Petersburg State University","grantNumber":"6.38.230.2015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002261","fundingName":"RFBR"},{"fundingName":"Russian Science Fund","grantNumber":"14-21-00041"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006769","fundingName":"RSF","grantNumber":"14-29-00142"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opinion Dynamics in Social Networks With Hostile Camps: Consensus vs. Polarization","sourcePdf":"tac-proskurnikov7-2471655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.300139S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7478173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"186","xplore-issue":"7478173","articleId":"7219413","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7219414,"authors":[{"name":"Olga Shcherbakova","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7365508/7219414/shche-2465176-small.gif","p":["Olga Shcherbakova (S\u201911) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics engineering from Moscow State Aviation Technological University, Moscow, Russia, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication technologies from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2013.","Her current research interests include image sensors for different applications and analog circuit design."]},"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Shcherbakova","id":"38180786900"},{"name":"Lucio Pancheri","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7365508/7219414/panch-2465176-small.gif","p":["Lucio Pancheri (M\u201911) received the Laurea degree in materials engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication technologies from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","He was a Research Scientist with Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, from 2006 to 2012.

Different knobs can be explored to obtain the dominating tradeoff curve (Pareto-front). So far previous works have only focused on exploring one set of knobs or combining all of them together without considering the underlying implications of each of these knobs. This paper presents the first method that accelerates the design space exploration (DSE) by first classifying these knobs and exploring them sequentially, thus reducing the design space to be explored considerably. In particular: 1) local synthesis directives in the form of pragmas inserted directly at the source code and 2) functional units (FUs) number and type. Second, we propose a probabilistic method to further accelerate the DSE by computing the probability of each micro-architecture generated after the pragma exploration stage, to lead to new dominating designs and in turn exploring only those with the highest probabilities. One additional contribution is that the explorer for both knobs are implemented using novel heuristics. The pragma based explorer is based on ant colony optimization, while the FU explorer explores the number and type of FUs in order to further maximize the total amount of resource sharing that can be extracted. Experimental results show that our proposed method finds Pareto-fronts of similar quality than an exploration method optimized for quality of their results, while accelerating the DSE by an average of 12.2\u00d7.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7419205/07219423.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Multiknob High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration Acceleration","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2472007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2472007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Multiknob High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration Acceleration","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15802941","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7219423/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Multiknob High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration Acceleration","sourcePdf":"tcad-carrionschafer-2472007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072996S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7419205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7419205","articleId":"7219423","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219432,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Ditzler","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/7229393/7219432/7219432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gregory Ditzler (S'04\u2013M'15) received a B.Sc. degree from the Pennsylvania College of Technology, Williamsport, PA, USA, in 2008 and a M.Sc. degree from Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA in 2011.

Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data. Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow. Our goal in this effort is not to determine the best algorithm in terms accuracy-as that depends on the specific application-but rather to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each of the approach we discuss and provide insight on how they can be improved for predictive metagenomic analysis.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7728/7229393/7219432-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","volume":"14","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15413891","pubMedId":"26316190","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219432/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Layer and Recursive Neural Networks for Metagenomic Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Energy"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"0845827, 0926159 and 1120622"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Multi-Layer and Recursive Neural Networks for Metagenomic Classification","sourcePdf":"tnb-ditzler-2461219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144279S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7229393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7229393","articleId":"7219432","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7219433,"authors":[{"name":"Loredana Caruccio","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo II, nr. 132, Fisciano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7347496/7219433/caruc-small.gif","p":["Loredana Caruccio received the BSc (cum laude) and MSc (cum laude)\n degrees in computer science from the University of Salerno in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

This approach ultimately helps to realize all-wheel independent control for improved vehicle dynamics and increased vehicle design freedom. However, when space allowed for an in-wheel motor is taken into consideration, high torque density, high efficiency, and wide-speed-range capability are typically required. This paper specifically investigates a 20-pole\u201324-slot surface permanent magnet synchronous motor with consequent pole rotor for in-wheel direct drive since this topology is well suited for high-pole motors and thus high-torque direct-drive applications. Extensive finite-element analysis is carried out to characterize the proposed motor, and the practical feasibility of the proposed motor is discussed. Finally, the validity of the analysis was experimentally verified.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7352402/07219435.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2472375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2472375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a 20-Pole\u201324-Slot SPMSM With Consequent Pole Rotor for In-Wheel Direct Drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Traction motors","Permanent magnet motors","Reluctance motors","Rotors","Finite element analysis","Electric vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consequent pole (CP)","fractional slot","direct drive","outer rotor","finite element analysis (FEA)","surface permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM)","in-wheel drive"]},{"kwd":["Consequent pole (CP)","direct drive","finite-element analysis (FEA)","fractional slot","in-wheel drive","outer rotor","surface permanent-magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Development of a 20-Pole\u201324-Slot SPMSM With Consequent Pole Rotor for In-Wheel Direct Drive","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7219435/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a 20-Pole\u201324-Slot SPMSM With Consequent Pole Rotor for In-Wheel Direct Drive","sourcePdf":"tie-chung-2472375-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103931S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7352402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7352402","articleId":"7219435","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219436,"authors":[{"name":"Inam Ullah Nutkani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7352402/7219436/nutka-2472361-small.gif","p":["\n\nInam Ullah Nutkani (SM'14) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan, in 2003 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in power engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2007 and 2014, respectively.","His employment experience includes working as an Assistant Executive Engineer with KESC Karachi; an Assistant Manager with NESCOM, Islamabad, Pakistan; an Electrical Engineer with West Energy, Singapore; and a Senior Design Engineer with JM Pang & Seah, Singapore, During 2003 to 2008.

Building on excellent algorithms of recent years, we designed from scratch a novel system that uses the same features for all SLAM tasks: tracking, mapping, relocalization, and loop closing.

From it, a decision-maker can observe the evolution process, estimate location, range, and distribution of Pareto front, assess quality of the approximated front and tradeoff between objectives, and easily select preferred solutions. Furthermore, its applications can be scalable to any dimensions, handle a large number of individuals on front, and simultaneously visualize multiple fronts for comparison. Based on this visualization tool, a performance metric, named polar-metric, is designed. The convergence of the approximate front is measured by radial values of all population members on that front. Meanwhile, the diversity performance is mainly determined by niche count of each subregion in a high-dimensional objective space.

tracing filamentary structures in both neuronal and retinal images. It is often crucial to identify single neurons in neuronal networks, or separate vessel tree structures in retinal blood vessel networks, in applications such as drug screening for neurological disorders or computer-aided diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Both tasks are challenging as the same bottleneck issue of filament crossovers is commonly encountered, which essentially hinders the ability of existing systems to conduct large-scale drug screening or practical clinical usage. To address the filament crossovers' problem, a two-step graph-theoretical approach is proposed in this paper. The first step focuses on segmenting filamentary pixels out of the background. This produces a filament segmentation map used as input for the second step, where they are further separated into disjointed filaments. Key to our approach is the idea that the problem can be reformulated as label propagation over directed graphs, such that the graph is to be partitioned into disjoint sub-graphs, or equivalently, each of the neurons (vessel trees) is separated from the rest of the neuronal (vessel) network. This enables us to make the interesting connection between the tracing problem and the digraph matrix-forest theorem in algebraic graph theory for the first time. Empirical experiments on neuronal and retinal image datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"35","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219463/","accessionNumber":"15673360","pubMedId":"26316029","displayDocTitle":"A Graph-Theoretical Approach for Tracing Filamentary Structures in Neuronal and Retinal Images","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Graph-Theoretical Approach for Tracing Filamentary Structures in Neuronal and Retinal Images","sourcePdf":"tmi-cheng-2465962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119097S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7368217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7368217","articleId":"7219463","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7219467,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Warin","affiliation":["IUT Informatique, University of Littoral C\u00f4ted'Opale, Calais, Pas-de-Calais, France"],"bio":{"p":["Bruno Warin is an Associate Professor with the Laboratory of Informatics, Signal and Images, Littoral C\u00f4te d'Opale University, Calais, France.

The MRP method is designed around a meta-principle that considers the project learning activity as a role-playing game based on two projects: a learning project and an engineering project. The meta-principle is complemented by five principles that provide a framework to guide the working practices of student teams: distribution of responsibilities; regular interactions and solicitations within the team; anticipation and continuous improvement; positive interdependence and alternating individual/collective work; and open communication and content management. This paper presents the implementation of MRP in a course teaching software engineering, UML language, and project management. The results show that MRP helped the course's students to acquire important professional knowledge and skills, experience near-real-world professional realities, and develop their abilities to work both in teams and autonomously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","volume":"59","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15971392","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7219467/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Role Project (MRP): A New Project-Based Learning Method for STEM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Role Project (MRP): A New Project-Based Learning Method for STEM","sourcePdf":"te-warin-2462809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083308S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"7464383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7464383","articleId":"7219467","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":7219471,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Arshad Nasir","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7219471/nasir-2472295-small.gif","p":["\n\nAli Arshad Nasir (S'09\u2013M'13) received the Ph.D. degree in \ntelecommunications engineering from the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra, ACT, Australia, in 2013.","He is an Assistant Professor with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of \nSciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.

Equipped with a power splitter and a wireless energy harvester, the self-sustaining relay scavenges radio-frequency (RF) energy from the received signals to process and forward information. Our aim is to develop a resource allocation scheme that jointly optimizes 1) BS transmit power, 2) received power-splitting factors for energy harvesting and information processing at the relays, and 3) relay transmit power. In the face of strong intercell interference and limited radio resources, we formulate three highly nonconvex problems with the objectives of sum-rate maximization, max-min throughput fairness, and sum-power minimization. To solve such challenging problems, we propose applying the successive convex approximation approach and devising iterative algorithms based on geometric programming and difference-of-convex-function programming. The proposed algorithms transform the nonconvex problems into a sequence of convex problems, each of which is solved very efficiently by the interior-point method. We prove that our algorithms converge to the locally optimal solutions that satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the original nonconvex problems. We then extend our results to the case of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying with variable timeslot durations. We show that our resource allocation solutions in this case offer better throughput than that of the AF counterpart with equal timeslot durations, albeit at higher computational complexity. Numerical results confirm that the proposed joint optimization solutions substantially improve network performance, compared with cases where the radio resource parameters are individually optimized.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2472295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07219471.pdf","startPage":"6168","endPage":"6183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2472295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Resource Optimization for Multicell Networks With Wireless Energy Harvesting Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219471/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Resource Optimization for Multicell Networks With Wireless Energy Harvesting Relays","volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209999","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219471/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council's Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP140101133"},{"fundingName":"University of Newcastle's Early Career Researcher","grantNumber":"G1301282"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Resource Optimization for Multicell Networks With Wireless Energy Harvesting Relays","sourcePdf":"tvt-nasir-2472295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152337S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7219471","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219473,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Chu","affiliation":["Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7219473/zhchu-2472405-small.gif","p":["Zheng Chu received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Electric and Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry (ZZULI), Zhengzhou, China, the M.Sc. degree from the School of Electric and Electronic Engineering, North China Electrical Power University (NCEPU), China, and the M.Sc. degree (Distinction) from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in 2007, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Specifically, we consider power minimization and secrecy rate maximization problems for this secrecy network. First, we formulate the power minimization problem based on the assumption that the legitimate transmitter has perfect channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate user and the eavesdroppers, where this problem can be reformulated into a second-order cone program (SOCP). In addition, we provide a closed-form solution of transmit beamforming for the scenario of an eavesdropper. Next, we consider robust secrecy rate optimization problems by incorporating two probabilistic channel uncertainties with CSI feedback. By exploiting the Bernstein-type inequality and S-Procedure to convert the probabilistic secrecy rate constraint into the determined constraint, we formulate this secrecy rate optimization problem into a convex optimization framework. Furthermore, we provide analyses to show the optimal transmit covariance matrix is rank-one for the proposed schemes. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of these two conservative approximation methods, where it is shown that the Bernstein-type inequality-based approach outperforms the S-Procedure approach in terms of the achievable secrecy rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219473/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15697444","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7219473/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Rate Optimizations for a MISO Secrecy Channel with Multiple Multiantenna Eavesdroppers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council (CSC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Rate Optimizations for a MISO Secrecy Channel with Multiple Multiantenna Eavesdroppers","sourcePdf":"twc-chu-2472405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165912S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7219473","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7219474,"authors":[{"name":"Qichao Xu","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7219474/xu-2472289-small.gif","p":["\n\nQichao Xu is currently working toward the Master's degree with the \nSchool of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.","His research interests include wireless network architecture and mobile social networks."]},"firstName":"Qichao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085403797"},{"name":"Zhou Su","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7219474/su-2472289-small.gif","p":["\n\nZhou Su (S'03\u2013M'06) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Xi'an \nJiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Waseda University, Tokyo, \nJapan, in 2003.","From 1999 to 2000, he was an exchange student between Waseda University and Xi'an Jiaotong University.

This mode needs all nodes to work in a cooperative way. However, mobile nodes may be selfish and might not be willing to forward data to others due to the limited resources (e.g., buffer and energy), resulting in degraded system performance. To tackle the aforementioned problem, this paper proposes a novel incentive scheme to stimulate selfish nodes to participate in bundle delivery in MSNs. At first, a virtual currency is introduced to pay for the relay service. Then, a bundle carrier selects a relay node from its friends or other strangers based on its status. Next, a bargain game is employed to model the transaction pricing for relay service. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposal can improve the performance of the existing schemes significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2472289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07219474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2472289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6692","endPage":"6702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theoretical Incentive Scheme for Relay Selection Services in Mobile Social Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Game Theoretical Incentive Scheme for Relay Selection Services in Mobile Social Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219474/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210025","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7219474/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"12JC1404201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game Theoretical Incentive Scheme for Relay Selection Services in Mobile Social Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-su-2472289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099109S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7219474","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219476,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Telecommunications, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7219476/7219476-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree with 1st Class Honours from University of Tehran, Iran, in September 2008, the M.Sc.

In the proposed scheme, referred to as the analog fountain compressive sensing (AFCS), each measurement is generated from a linear combination of L randomly selected binary signal elements with real weight coefficients. The weight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called measurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution function. We propose a simple verification based reconstruction algorithm for the AFCS in the noiseless case. The proposed verification based decoder is analyzed through SUM-OR tree analytical approach and an optimization problem is formulated to find the optimum measurement degree to minimize the number of measurements required for the reconstruction of binary sparse signals. We show that in the AFCS, the number of required measurements is of O(-nlog(1-k/n)), where n is the signal length and L=k is the signal sparsity level. Simulation results show that the AFCS can perfectly recover all non-zero elements of the sparse binary signal with a significantly reduced number of measurements, compared to the conventional binary CS and l1-minimization approaches in a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNRs) by using the standard message passing decoder. Finally, we show a practical application of the AFCS for the sparse event detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where the sensors' readings can be treated as measurements from the CS point of view.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2472362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7323913/07219476.pdf","startPage":"6540","endPage":"6552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2472362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary Compressive Sensing Via Analog Fountain Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219476/","displayDocTitle":"Binary Compressive Sensing Via Analog Fountain Coding","volume":"63","issue":"24","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15645816","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219476/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"DP150104019, FT120100487 and LP150100994"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Compressive Sensing Via Analog Fountain Coding","sourcePdf":"tsp-shirvanimoghaddam-2472362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132689S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7323913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7323913","articleId":"7219476","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7219477,"authors":[{"name":"Longbo Huang","affiliation":["Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7544544/7219477/7219477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Longbo Huang received the B.E. degree from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","He then worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA, from 2011 to 2012.

Based on a lookahead-window prediction model, we first establish a novel queue-equivalence between the predictive queueing system with a fully efficient scheduling scheme and an equivalent queueing system without prediction. This result allows us to analytically demonstrate that predictive scheduling necessarily improves system delay performance and drives it to zero with increasing prediction power. It also enables us to exactly determine the required prediction power for different systems and study its impact on tail delay. We then propose the Predictive Backpressure (PBP) algorithm for achieving optimal utility performance in such predictive systems. PBP efficiently incorporates prediction into stochastic system control and avoids the great complication due to the exponential state space growth in the prediction window size. We show that PBP achieves a utility performance that is within O(\u03b5) of the optimal, for any \u03b5 > 0, while guaranteeing that the system delay distribution is a shifted-to-the-left version of that under the original Backpressure algorithm. Hence, the average delay under PBP is strictly better than that under Backpressure, and vanishes with increasing prediction window size. This implies that the resulting utility-delay tradeoff with predictive scheduling can beat the known optimal [O(\u03b5),O(log(1/\u03b5))] tradeoff for systems without prediction. We also develop the Predictable-Only PBP (POPBP) algorithm and show that it effectively reduces packet delay in systems where traffic can only be predicted but not pre-served.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When Backpressure Meets Predictive Scheduling","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2460749","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7544544/07219477.pdf","startPage":"2237","endPage":"2250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2460749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"When Backpressure Meets Predictive Scheduling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7219477/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231753","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61033001, 61361136003 and 61303195"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When Backpressure Meets Predictive Scheduling","sourcePdf":"tnet-huang-2460749-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164385S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7219477","onlineDate":"24 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7219529,"authors":[{"name":"Yasir Saleem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Networked System, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yasir","lastName":"Saleem","id":"37938098200"},{"name":"Kok-Lim Alvin Yau","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Networked System, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kok-Lim Alvin","lastName":"Yau","id":"37683359300"},{"name":"Hafizal Mohamad","affiliation":["Wireless Network and Protocol Research Lab, MIMOS Berhad, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hafizal","lastName":"Mohamad","id":"37532339700"},{"name":"Nordin Ramli","affiliation":["Wireless Network and Protocol Research Lab, MIMOS Berhad, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nordin","lastName":"Ramli","id":"37699538900"},{"name":"Mubashir Husain Rehmani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Wah Cantt, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Mubashir Husain","lastName":"Rehmani","id":"37545374700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7951-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219529","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Interference","Cognitive radio","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Maintenance engineering","Logic gates","Merging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","learning (artificial intelligence)","radio networks","radio spectrum management","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel selection-cluster-based routing scheme","reinforcement learning","cognitive radio networks","CRN","licensed spectrum underutilization problem","white spaces","interference minimization","channel availability dynamicity","spectrum-aware cluster-based routing","SMART","SU source node","destination node","artificial intelligence approach","SU-PU interference","packet delivery ratio","packet delivery ratio degradation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","clustering","routing","reinforcement learning"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio network (CRN) has emerged as a promising solution to solve the problem of underutilization of licensed spectrum. It allows opportunistic access of unutilized spectrum (or white spaces) by unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs) whilst minimizing interference to licensed users (or primary users, PUs). The dynamicity of channel availability has imposed additional challenges for routing in CRNs. Besides providing optimal routes to SUs for communication, one of the key requirements of routing in CRNs is to minimize interference to PUs. In this paper, we propose a joint channel selection and cluster-based routing scheme called SMART (SpectruM-Aware cluster-based RouTing) for CRNs. SMART enables SUs to form clusters in the network, and subsequently, it enables SU source node to search for a route to its destination node in the underlying clustered network. SMART applies an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning in order to maximize network performance, such as SU-PU interference and packet delivery ratio. Simulation results show that SMART reduces significant interference to PUs without significance degradation of packet delivery ratio when compared to clustered scheme without cluster maintenance (i.e., SMART-NO-MNT) and non-clustered scheme (i.e., spectrum-aware AODV or SA-AODV).","doi":"10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219529","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194237/7219513/07219529.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219529","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel selection and cluster-based routing scheme based on reinforcement learning for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel selection and cluster-based routing scheme based on reinforcement learning for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219529/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15403544","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel selection and cluster-based routing scheme based on reinforcement learning for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089781S","chronDate":"21-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194237","isNumber":"7219513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194237","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7219513","articleId":"7219529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219539,"authors":[{"name":"Issa Nasser Salim Al-Ghatrifi","affiliation":["Nizwa College of Technology, Nizwa, OM"],"firstName":"Issa Nasser","lastName":"Salim Al-Ghatrifi","id":"37088495523"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7951-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219539","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"abstract":"In Sultanate of Oman, higher education institutions have devoted significant human and fiscal investments in IT to support the priorities tied to teaching and learning. However, there are still issues in current high education systems associated with high cost and inefficiency in-terms of scalability, flexibility, availability, data recovery, accessibility and security due to the growing need for IT infrastructure including servers, storage and software. Higher education institutes have to spend more on hardware and software purchasing, maintenance, upgrading and licensing. Cloud computing emerged as an Internet based solution, whereby computing resources are provided to consumers and organizations as services on demand on pay per use bases. Cloud computing provides higher education information delivery, communication and collaboration. It enables the education organizations to scale their IT infrastructure while reducing the administrative burden. Cloud computing facilitates greater levels of provisioning and automation in cost effective manner. However, still there are some issues regarding to security, privacy and trust that acts as a barrier against full adoption of cloud computing in higher education. Throughout this paper we identify the cloud offerings, issues and strategy of implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control

been proposed in this paper. This algorithm is explicitly designed for convolutive mixtures of communication signals with automatic wavelet shrinkage denoising. The proposed approach is more reliable due to the combination of subband blind source algorithm and wavelet de-noising. It ultimately resolves the drawbacks of BSR algorithm in noisy environment of communication signals. Moreover, the speed of algorithm has been improved by employing shorter de-mixing filter in each sub band domain. The proposed methodology has improved efficiency in term of speed and accuracy as compared to the previous approaches. Better separation ability has been achieved by using an adaptive step size based on non-linear function in each subband. Particular settings have been applied to \u201cde-mixing filter length\u201d in various subbands to enhance the separation capability. Wavelet shrinkage de-noising has been applied to the recovered output of each subband to improve the algorithmic performance in noisy environment. \u201cSURE Shrink\u201d model is used for nonlinear soft thresholding of approximate coefficients of discrete wavelet transforms. It results improved performance in noisy environment. 16QAM communication signals with same carrier frequency are considered for Computer simulation in MATLAB for the verification of the improved results of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219550","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194237/7219513/07219550.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219513","startPage":"122","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive approach to subband domain convolutive blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive approach to subband domain convolutive blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219550/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15403505","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219550/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive approach to subband domain convolutive blind source separation","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080666S","chronDate":"21-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194237","isNumber":"7219513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194237","xplore-issue":"7219513","articleId":"7219550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219559,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Taha","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Department, Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Taha","id":"38542675600"},{"name":"Dia abu Alnadi","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Department, Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Dia","lastName":"abu Alnadi","id":"37085679261"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7951-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219559","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219559","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Computational efficiency","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Optimization methods","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOA estimation","particle swarm optimization","direction of arrival estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","fitness function","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Uniform linear array","Direction of arrival","Maximum Likelihood","Constrained optimization","Particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219559","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194237/7219513/07219559.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","startPage":"167","endPage":"171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA estimation for unknown number of signals using particle swarm optimization","abstract":"In this paper, the direction of arrival estimation for unknown number of signals is formulated as a constrained optimization based on the Maximum Likelihood criterion.

To minimize the fitness, we provide an algorithm based on the hybridization of the particle swarm optimization. In this algorithm, an initial estimate of the parameters is obtained using the real valued optimizer then the exact parameters are resolved using the binary optimizer.

Over the years, the use of learning machine and artificial intelligence techniques has transformed the process of diagnosing breast cancer. However, the accurate classification of breast cancer is still a medical challenge faced by researchers. Difficulties are routinely encountered in the search for sets of features that provide adequate distinctiveness required for classifying breast tissues into groups of normal and abnormal. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose a system for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of breast abnormality using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models based on two dimensional wavelet transform. Three major approaches were taken in this study; preprocessing, wavelet decomposition analysis and neural network approaches. The first approach entails the preprocessing step for breast profile extraction, carried out by eliminating the low frequency components of the mammogram, leaving behind subbands containing high frequency coefficients, based on the idea that microcalcifications signify high frequency coefficients. The next approach involves features extraction derived from wavelet decomposition analysis. The final approach is referred to as the classification stage that utilizes back propagation neural network to distinguish abnormal tissue from normal ones. The proposed system was tested on the MIAS database, resulting in 91.64% succession rate of classification.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mammography","Feature extraction","Noise","Neural networks","Wavelet transforms","Breast"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biological tissues","biomedical MRI","cancer","mammography","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast abnormality detection","mammograms","artificial neural network","breast cancer","diseases","patient diagnosis","ultrasound","MRI","biopsy","learning machine","artificial intelligence","ANN models","back propagation neural network","abnormal tissue"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)","Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)","Mammogram thresholding","Contrast stretching enhancement","Segmentation","Median filter Computer aided design","Mass","Microcalcification","Wavelet analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219577","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194237/7219513/07219577.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breast abnormality detection in mammograms using Artificial Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Breast abnormality detection in mammograms using Artificial Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219577/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219577/","accessionNumber":"15403438","conferenceDate":"21-23 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breast abnormality detection in mammograms using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112687S","chronDate":"21-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194237","isNumber":"7219513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194237","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7219513","articleId":"7219577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7219580,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, a method is proposed for surveillance systems to stabilize the camera vibrations and also to detect camera tampering. This method uses SURF feature detection and matching using RANSAC algorithm to achieve homogenous coordinates and then estimates the motion between consecutive frames.

Peak sidelobe minimization does not effectively minimize the overall sidelobe of a beampattern formed by collaborative beamforming. Two main contributions are highlighted in this paper. First, we proposed a new fitness function based on directivity instead of the conventional peak sidelobe. Second, we applied the genetic algorithm (GA) to reduce the sidelobe in collaborative beamforming. This proposed solution is implemented without any feedback from the unintended receiver(s). In the light of reduced sidelobe, we recorded the resultant capacity and calculated its improvement. Results showing up to 14% of capacity improvement, proving the efficacy of the proposed methodologies: the GA and the new fitness function.","doi":"10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219592","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194237/7219513/07219592.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219592","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","startPage":"332","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference reduction and capacity improvement in collaborative beamforming networks via directivity optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interference reduction and capacity improvement in collaborative beamforming networks via directivity optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219592/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219592/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15403435","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference reduction and capacity improvement in collaborative beamforming networks via directivity optimization","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068436S","chronDate":"21-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194237","isNumber":"7219513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194237","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7219513","articleId":"7219592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219594,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

In this work, in order to obtain the best result, different amounts of parameters such as iteration, null and the boundary have been implemented for more than 30 times. This is done to improve the null steering, signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), direction detection and power consumption efficiency. The LCMV beamformer directs the beam radiation through the desired point of user using allocated weight vectors derived from the received signal. However, the weights derived from the received signal by the LCMV method (WLCMV) are not usually focused on the users point accurately. Thus, there will be significant power wastage in other directions rather than the desired users point. Accordingly, here the FA technique is applied into the LCMV beamformer to modify the weights of LCMV. The FA is a metaheuristic algorithm based on the flashing lights of fireflies. It has perfectly solved many problems in almost all engineering fields, such as, image processing, industrial optimization, antenna design and business optimization, etc. The FA method optimizes the light intensity of fireflies by updating the attractiveness and the position of each firefly based on the brightest firefly or the highest light intensity value. Ultimately, all fireflies will gather around the firefly with the highest light intensity value. In this research, results achieved from the optimization of LCMV using FA are simulated in several cases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219513","startPage":"441","endPage":"445","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194237/7219513/07219615.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR improvement using Firefly Algorithm (FA) for Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219615/","displayDocTitle":"SINR improvement using Firefly Algorithm (FA) for Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming technique","conferenceDate":"21-23 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15403515","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR improvement using Firefly Algorithm (FA) for Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming technique","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059474S","chronDate":"21-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194237","isNumber":"7219513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194237","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7219513","articleId":"7219615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7219626,"authors":[{"name":"Refik Caglar Kizilirmak","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"firstName":"Refik Caglar","lastName":"Kizilirmak","id":"37085347344"},{"name":"Yau Hee Kho","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"firstName":"Yau Hee","lastName":"Kho","id":"37085365370"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7951-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219626","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"abstract":"In this work, we propose a method to mitigate the interference caused by other light sources for OFDM based visible light communication systems.

However, with an explosion of wireless mobile devices and services, there are still some challenges that cannot be accommodated even by 4G, such as the spectrum crises and high energy consumption. Wireless system designers have been facing the continuously increasing demand for high data rates and mobility required by new wireless applications and therefore have started research on fifth generation (5G) wireless systems that are expected to be deployed beyond 2020.

investigate the performance of optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM) based visible light broadcasting. Although indoor spaces usually have more than one light source, most of the existing works on visible light communication (VLC) in the current literature consider point-to-point communication and few efforts have been made on the scenarios with multiple transmitters. In this work, we consider a broadcasting scenario in which multiple transmitters (light sources) simultaneously emit the same information. Since this network structure constitutes a similar network topology to single frequency networks (SFN) in OFDM-based digital audio/video broadcasting, we coin the term \u201csingle color network (SCN)\u201d to refer these visible light broadcasting systems. Based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we present the error rate performance of SCNs as well as discuss their lighting performance.","doi":"10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219638","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194237/7219513/07219638.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single color networks: OFDM-based visible light broadcasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219638/","displayDocTitle":"Single color networks: OFDM-based visible light broadcasting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15412403","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219638/","conferenceDate":"21-23 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single color networks: OFDM-based visible light broadcasting","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117595S","chronDate":"21-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194237","isNumber":"7219513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194237","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7219513","articleId":"7219638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219648,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Radio technology is emerged as a platform to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity in wireless networks. Whenever designing a routing algorithm for cognitive radio ad hoc networks, the aggregate interference from secondary users to the primary user must be considered. In this paper, a Distributed Game theory-based Routing algorithm (DGR) is proposed. The proposed routing algorithm not only considers the interference between Secondary Users (SUs) but also the aggregate interference from SUs to the Primary User (PU). The proposed relay selection scheme prefers to select an upstream neighbor who has participated less in the network's transmissions and is far away from the PU. DGR algorithm is distributed, that avoids the high cost of centralized coordination, high information-gathering delay, and single point of failure problems. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can find shorter routes with lower interference to the PU, compared to the previous one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15402974","htmlLink":"/document/7219796/","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Game theory-based Routing protocol for Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Game theory-based Routing protocol for Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Songkhla, Thailand","sourcePdf":"371570142383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069087S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190942","isNumber":"7219755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190942","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7219755","articleId":"7219796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219800,"authors":[{"name":"Erfan Arzhmand","affiliation":["Computer and Electricity Department, Shomal University, Mazandaran, Iran"],"firstName":"Erfan","lastName":"Arzhmand","id":"37085666438"},{"name":"Hossein Rashid","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Islamic Azad University, Kerman, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Rashid","id":"37085661784"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1966-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1965-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219800","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219800","abstract":"Wireless network solutions based on Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) are the main path for vehicle manufacturers and urban traffic management systems to find the bests in convenience, intelligence and safety of traveling and transportation.

The objective of this research is to develop algorithm that can effectively classify two-class imbalanced datasets, which have complicated distributions and large overlap between classes. These problems can make the learners failed in classification. Therefore, the contribution of CLUS is to alleviate the large overlap between classes and to balance the class distribution. Firstly, all instances are partitioned into k clusters using k-mean algorithms. Next, CLUS created the new subset, which consists of the instances from different classes, which have different characteristics. Secondly, for each subset, oversampling method is applied. Finally, SVMs is used to classify each training set based on majority vote. CLUS is tested using eight imbalanced benchmark datasets and assessed over two metrics; F-measure and AUC. The experimental results show that CLUS outperforms other methods especially when the number of imbalanced ratio is high.","doi":"10.1109/JCSSE.2015.7219810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCSSE.2015.7219810","startPage":"281","endPage":"286","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190942/7219755/07219810.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CLUS: A new hybrid sampling classification for imbalanced data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"CLUS: A new hybrid sampling classification for imbalanced data","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219810/","accessionNumber":"15402989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219810/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLUS: A new hybrid sampling classification for imbalanced data","confLoc":"Songkhla, Thailand","sourcePdf":"511570120825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068106S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190942","isNumber":"7219755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190942","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7219755","articleId":"7219810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":7219833,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The channel estimation algorithms like Maximum Likelihood (ML), Minimum Mean Square (MMSE) and Zero Forcing (ZF) is taken in to account with the consideration of color noise. In addition to that, MIMO-OFDM techniques utilized to produce better efficiency. If the channel condition is very poor because of the multipath fading then the estimation technique is swifts adaptively to estimate the signal variance.

Hence, for an energy efficient and stable communication to be established among the nodes, the nodes must be organized into groups called clusters. Associativity is one among the good metrics that can configure the speed of a node with respect to its neighbour. In the proposed work, along with associativity, residual energy and nodes degree are the multiple metrics that are been considered to elect the clusterheads. Optimal clustering of nodes in dynamic MANET is an NP-Hard problem that can be solved by tools that include evolutionary computation, swarm optimization, etc. Among the swarm optimization methods, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques were been proved to be the efficient and promising methodologies for solving the optimization problems. These techniques are finding their popularity in wide range due to their adaptable nature and ability to optimize even large complex search spaces applied to non-differentiable cost functions. Hence, the main objective of the proposed work is to select stable clusterhead by considering multiple metrics that are used to frame the fitness function for GA and PSO. Since the proposed work includes energy as one of the metrics, it can be used in distributed MANET environment with nodes having different energy levels. Since, the associativity of nodes reflects the stability with their neighbours, the proposed system can also be used in dynamic and static environment. The proposed work has been simulated with both GA and PSO, and the results have shown that PSO resulted with better performance compared to GA, in terms of clusterhead count under various simulation environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219839","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194238/7219823/07219839.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive cluster formation in MANET using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Measurement","Clustering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms","mobile ad hoc networks","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive cluster formation","particle swarm optimization","mobile ad hoc network","energy efficient communication","stable communication","residual energy","node degree","multiple metrics","clusterhead elect","node optimal clustering","NP-hard problem","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithm","nondifferentiable cost functions","fitness function","GA","PSO","distributed MANET environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["association","degree difference","fitness function","population","relative mobility","swarm optimization","encoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive cluster formation in MANET using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412459","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive cluster formation in MANET using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"19AdaptiveClusterFormationinMANET.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048697S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194238","isNumber":"7219823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194238","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7219823","articleId":"7219839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7219843,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Medium Access control protocol is suitable for channel sharing and proved that the resulting controlled channel sharing performs better than the traditional sensing based Medium Access algorithms. The projected algorithm for solving this problem has provably tight bounds in terms of the max-min throughput.

Also the ergodic capacities of PR and CR links under Constant Power (CP) and Water filling (WF) power control policies have been analyzed. In order to mitigate the interference caused to the PR receiver from the CR transmitter, interference temperature constraint at the PR receiver in the form of either Average Interference Power (AIP) constraint or Peak Interference Power (PIP) constraint has been considered. To maximize ergodic capacity of the PR link and CR link and to mitigate the interference from CR transmitters, a novel Block Diagonalization (BD) based WF power control policy has been proposed. In this proposed scheme, secondary user can learn the null space of the other secondary users to maintain the interference constraints of the primary user using BD. Also in this proposed algorithm, optimum power levels subjected to AIP and PIP constraints have been calculated using WF power control policy. The simulation results show that the proposed BD based WF power control policy achieves higher fading channel capacities for both PR and CR links compared to CP policy and WF power policy for the predefined AIP and PIP constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control scheme to mitigate interference for MIMO Cognitive Radio","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219850","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194238/7219823/07219850.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power control scheme to mitigate interference for MIMO Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219850/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412513","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control scheme to mitigate interference for MIMO Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"29PowerControlScheme.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044031S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194238","isNumber":"7219823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194238","xplore-issue":"7219823","articleId":"7219850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219856,"authors":[{"name":"Monisha Kanakaraj","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Technology, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Monisha","lastName":"Kanakaraj","id":"37085342162"},{"name":"Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"Ram Mohana Reddy","lastName":"Guddeti"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6823-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6822-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219856","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1944},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NLP based sentiment analysis on Twitter data using ensemble classifiers","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194238/7219823/07219856.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219823","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219856","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning algorithms","Twitter","Training","Sentiment analysis","Semantics","Signal processing algorithms","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","pattern classification","social networking (online)","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","NLP","sentiment analysis","Twitter data","sentiment classification","ensemble method","bag-of-words approach","opinion mining","online review","social media data","feature vector","machine learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sentiment Analysis","Ensemble classifier","Social Network Analysis","Semantic","Word Sense Disambiguation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219856","abstract":"Most sentiment analysis systems use bag-of-words approach for mining sentiments from the online reviews and social media data.

Employing more number of relay nodes reduces the sensing time, improves the quality of communication and increases throughput of system at reasonable complexity using compressive signal processing (CSP).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219823","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194238/7219823/07219863.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient spectrum sensing using compressive measurements in Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219863/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient spectrum sensing using compressive measurements in Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412465","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient spectrum sensing using compressive measurements in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"40AnEfficientSpectrumSensing.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049473S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194238","isNumber":"7219823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194238","xplore-issue":"7219823","articleId":"7219863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7219864,"authors":[{"name":"Kotha Nagarjuna","affiliation":["Easwari Engineering College, M.E Embedded System Technologies, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India"],"firstName":"Kotha","lastName":"Nagarjuna","id":"37085666221"},{"name":"G.R.

Aerial Vehicles are of various types like quadcopter, helicopter, multi-rotors, drones, etc. Each of the Aerial Vehicle has its own principle of operation and working environment. Quadcopter is the most preferred of the aerial vehicles owing to its simplicity and ease of control. Realizing a quadcopter is much easier and requires less cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles requires the aerial vehicle to take decision on its own without any user intervention. This includes the ability of the quadcopter to take off and land safely. The main challenge in the autonomous feature of the quadcopter is to land the UAV in the destination without an operator manually controlling the operation. In this project the landing mechanism of the UAV is monitored using gyroscope and accelerometer without any physical aid and image processing. The altitude value is monitored and the speed of the motors is decreased accordingly. The drones are completely autonomous and could also be instructed to follow a predefined path along the LoC from a remote computer. A predefined map of the surveillance area is fed as co-ordinates into the ARM Cortex series controlled boards. So moving from one co-ordinate location to another will be in a predefined path. A fail safe mechanism is also incorporated so that the working motors make up for the lost motor by running at 120% of the rated speed of the motor.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219864","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194238/7219823/07219864.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219823","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of effective landing mechanism for fully autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of effective landing mechanism for fully autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219864/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412501","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219864/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of effective landing mechanism for fully autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"41DesignofEffectiveLandingMechanism.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070364S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194238","isNumber":"7219823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194238","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7219823","articleId":"7219864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219867,"authors":[{"name":"Shweta Ghodeswar","affiliation":["International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT - B), Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Shweta","lastName":"Ghodeswar","id":"37085420964"},{"name":"P.G.

The approach presented in this paper gives a robust method for recognizing a subclass of digital modulation methods using SNR estimation and higher order cumulants. We have proposed a new feature to extend the hierarchical modulation classification proposed in the literature to include QPSK and 8PSK separation. Using higher order statistic based SNR estimation method at the receiver end we have given an SNR based adaptive thresholding technique which is capable of differentiating 16QAM, 32QAM, 64QAM, BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK signals with better false alarm rates compared to fixed threshold based recognition.

The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing Transmitter with 16 subcarriers and quadrature phase shift keying mapper is designed in system generator using Xilinx specific blocks. The design is then exported as a peripheral core to Xilinx platform studio (XPS), where a hardware platform is created. It is then integrated with other available peripheral cores and then exported to Software development kit (SDK). A transmitter application is created using embedded C code. Then the FPGA is programmed using a JTAG programming cable. This is the first approach which implements OFDM transmitter using WRAP v3 board. The files generated in XPS and SDK are dumped into the FPGA. Once FPGA is programmed, the transmitter starts transmission through GSM antenna.

This paper presents an anti-jamming mechanism for receivers in a cognitive radio network using Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation method combined with adaptive beamforming. The receiver obtains the required signal at the particular angle found by AoA estimation followed by improving the SNR of the signal using beamforming neglecting interference from signals sent by jammers at other angles. AoA techniques like Esprit, Music and Root-Music algorithms are used to estimate the angle of arrival of the incoming signal. The Conjugate gradient method is used in the process of adaptive beamforming which continuously adapts to the varying angle provided by the AoA estimation. Simulations results are given comparing the Esprit, Music and Root-Music algorithms based on different angle of arrivals and SNR values. Simulation results are also provided for the combined mechanism of AoA estimation with Conjugate gradient method which will prove to be an effective way to avoid jamming.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219875","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194238/7219823/07219875.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219875","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of anti-jamming technique using angle of Arrival estimation in CRN's","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of anti-jamming technique using angle of Arrival estimation in CRN's","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219875/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412461","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of anti-jamming technique using angle of Arrival estimation in CRN's","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"51PerformanceAnalysisofAntiJamming.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056256S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194238","isNumber":"7219823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194238","xplore-issue":"7219823","articleId":"7219875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7219876,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Most of the elements in spectrum are idle. Cognitive radio is a promising technique for allocating the idle spectrum into unlicensed users. Security shortage is a major challenging issue in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks (CRAHNs) that makes performance degradation on spectrum sensing and sharing. A selfish user pre-occupies the accessible bandwidth for their prospect usage and prohibits the progress secondary users whose makes the requirement for spectrum utility. Game theoretic model is proposed to detect the selfish attacker in CRAHNs. Channel state information (CSI) is considered to inform each user's channel handing information. The two strategy of Nash Equilibrium game model such as pure and mixed strategy for secondary users (SUs) and selfish secondary users (SSUs) are investigated and the selfish attacker is detected. Moreover a novel belief updating system is also proposed to the secondary users for knowing the CSI of the primary user.

It is based on the cross product of the vectors signal's electric-field and the associate magnetic-field, which directly computes the direction cosines of the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. The proposed method utilizes the waveform diversity benefit drawn from the coherent MIMO radar.

A highly linear current controller with multiple level temperatures detecting point is proposed and implemented. LED driving current is controlled linearly to reduce the brightness of the LED lighting to avoid the damage of the LED and to extend its life time. The range of temperature supported by this proposed design is from 60\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C. The proposed adaptive current controller is designed to deliver 100mA. It reduces the LED driving current 10% according to every 10\u00b0C rise in the ambient temperature instead of 25% current reduction for every 20\u00b0C after 110\u00b0C in the existing system. The proposed adaptive current controller reduces the driving current linearly and hence the flickering of LED is avoided compared to the existing system. Schematic and Layout of the proposed current controller is implemented in 0.18\u03bcm process technology and the simulation has been carried out using Cadence ADE with Spectre.

To compare the performance of the adders, recent algorithms of Weinberger, Ling and Manchester carry chain are selected amongst the high performance adders. These three algorithms are chosen because their efficient architectures make minimum dependency on bits over power, energy and delay than other VLSI adders. It has been observed that even though Manchester carry chain adder introduces more delay than other VLSI adders due to its chained architecture, it consumes less power due to its reduced transistor count. Weinberger adder has a parallel architecture with 2-bit conditional sum block that reduces the carry structure and overall computing delay compared to other high performance VLSI adders. Ling adder uses pseudo-carry which reduces number of logic stages compared to Weinberger adder. As a result of reduced logic stages, it takes least time to compute final carry compared to any other VLSI adders. The performance of the VLSI adders is compared based on power, energy consumption and delay. Advanced CMOS technology models (Predictive Technology Models) of 45nm, 32nm, 22nm and 16nm are used for simulation. HSPICE tool is used to simulate the performance of the VLSI adders.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194238/7219823/07219919.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance VLSI adders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Delays","Computer architecture","Signal processing algorithms","Very large scale integration","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS logic circuits","logic design","power consumption","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI adders","advanced CMOS technology","Manchester carry chain adder","reduced transistor count","Weinberger adder","conditional sum block","Ling adder","pseudo-carry","reduced logic stages","energy consumption","predictive technology models","HSPICE tool","storage capacity 64 bit","word length 2 bit","size 45 nm","size 32 nm","size 22 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Manchester carry chain adder","Weinberger adder","Ling adder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"High performance VLSI adders","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7219919/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412473","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance VLSI adders","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"91HighPerformanceVLSIAdders.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078612S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194238","isNumber":"7219823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194238","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7219823","articleId":"7219919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7219944,"authors":[{"name":"Illa Rizianiza","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Illa","lastName":"Rizianiza","id":"37085635744"},{"name":"Aulia Siti Aisjah","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Aulia Siti","lastName":"Aisjah","id":"38232907400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7711-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7709-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219944","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219944","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Wind speed","Java","Neurons","Oceans","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","geophysics computing","neural nets","ocean waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["significant wave height prediction","Java Sea","artificial neural network","domestic shipping","international shipping","marine accident","backpropagation algorithm","RMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["backpropagation","significant wave height","wind speed","wind direction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISITIA.2015.7219944","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203314/7219932/07219944.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","startPage":"5","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITIA.2015.7219944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of significant wave height in The Java Sea using Artificial Neural Network","abstract":"The Java Sea is one of the busiest ship traffic both of domestic and international shipping and potential marine accident is quite high.

The traffic light signal parameters that are optimized are offset, cycles, and splits time of each node of the considered road networks. The considered real road network consists of four junctions/nodes having different time signaling models. In this research, the PSO is attached in Aimsun 6.1 simulator via application interface (API) that is provided by Aimsun 6.1 simulator. The PSO algorithm creates n-particles of traffic light signal parameters and sends them to the Aimsun 6.1 simulator to perform the simulation. The output of simulation will be used to perform the particles evaluation and updating. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides better performance than base-line method (multi-element Genetics Algorithms (ME-GA) based optimization method) which can increase the real and base-line percentage of vehicle flow by about 15.76% and 4.13% of that of real and MEGA, respectively. In addition, the PSO is faster to achieve convergence than base-line method for considered network.","doi":"10.1109/ISITIA.2015.7219945","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203314/7219932/07219945.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","publicationTitle":"2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITIA.2015.7219945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic light signal parameters optimization using particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7219945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Traffic light signal parameters optimization using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15412654","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7219945/","conferenceDate":"20-21 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic light signal parameters optimization using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063087S","chronDate":"20-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7203314","isNumber":"7219932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203314","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7219932","articleId":"7219945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7219974,"authors":[{"name":"Anang Tjahjono","affiliation":["Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia","Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember"],"firstName":"Anang","lastName":"Tjahjono","id":"37085456671"},{"name":"Dimas Okky Anggriawan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember"],"firstName":"Dimas Okky","lastName":"Anggriawan","id":"37085456905"},{"name":"Ardyono Priyadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember"],"firstName":"Ardyono","lastName":"Priyadi","id":"37394086200"},{"name":"Margo Pujiantara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember"],"firstName":"Margo","lastName":"Pujiantara","id":"37828672900"},{"name":"Mauridhi Hery Purnomo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember"],"firstName":"Mauridhi Hery","lastName":"Purnomo","id":"37294902900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7711-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7709-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7219974","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7219974","abstract":"Overcurrent relays (OCRs) play an important role in the protection component that requires high reliability to maintain high security for power systems.
