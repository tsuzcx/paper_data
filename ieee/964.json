Furthermore, the advances in metering infrastructure, such as the roll-out of smart meters in many countries worldwide, provides better observability of DNs. However, DERs in DNs usually belong to different stakeholders with alternative objectives that might even be conflicting (e.g., grid constraints are not considered by all). This paper presents a practical approach, based on a data-driven scheme, to safely use the DER operational flexibility and, at the same time, respect the objectives of individual households, network operators, and aggregators. First, a grid health estimator is constructed using Support-Vector Machines (SVM). Then, a real-time modification signal is used to alleviate network constraints violations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the MV and LV European benchmark grids.","doi":"10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9640135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9640135","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9639895/9639896/09640135.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9639896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safe Flexibility in Active Distribution Grids: A Practical Data-Driven Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Safe Flexibility in Active Distribution Grids: A Practical Data-Driven Approach","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"18 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9640135/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9640135/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safe Flexibility in Active Distribution Grids: A Practical Data-Driven Approach","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060495S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9639895","isNumber":"9639896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9639895","xplore-issue":"9639896","articleId":"9640135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9640279,"authors":[{"name":"Rofiqoh H.

Emotional information in the human brain can be captured through a multi-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG signals are recorded from multiple channels, representing information points of electrical activity from different parts of the brain. While the EEG signal of each channel is a sequence, some studies use one dimension in recognizing patterns, and the signal from the next channel is a continuation of the sequence from the previous channel. It makes the channel sequence less maintained so that the EEG signal processing from multi-channel is seen as a matrix, i.e., the vertical direction is the signal from various channels. While the horizontal direction of the sequence of each channel. So that the signal processing of the multi-channel is rich in information in the appropriate order, this study used 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for emotion recognition, with various architectures and configurations to get the best performance. In addition, the EEG signal needs to be extracted, which reflects the emotion variable first using a Wavelet. That is the 4-45 Hz frequency band of Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. The results show that two-dimensional CNN, which pays attention to signal order, produced the best accuracy of 83.44% compared to 75.97% with one-dimensional CNN. Experiments gave the best configuration used eight layers and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) weight correction.","doi":"10.1109/ICAICTA53211.2021.9640279","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concepts, Theory and Applications (ICAICTA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICTA53211.2021.9640279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9640246","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concepts, Theory and Applications (ICAICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9639890/9640246/09640279.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion Recognition of EEG Signals Using Wavelet Filter and Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9640279/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Emotion Recognition of EEG Signals Using Wavelet Filter and Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9640279/","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion Recognition of EEG Signals Using Wavelet Filter and Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"paper_78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072182S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9639890","isNumber":"9640246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9639890","xplore-issue":"9640246","articleId":"9640279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9640299,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-4347"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2191"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3865"}],"articleNumber":"9640299","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2021 Index IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol. 33","abstract":"Presents the 2021 subject/author index for this publication.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9639435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2021.3128365","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2021.3128365","startPage":"1","endPage":"37","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/9639435/09640299.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9640299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9640299/","displayDocTitle":"2021 Index IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol. 33","volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2021 Index IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol. 33","sourcePdf":"tkde-index-3128365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027413S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","isNumber":"9639435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","articleId":"9640299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":9640649,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Customer expectations, market trends, and people\u2019s attitudes are determined by sentiment analysis. It aids in the expansion of a business and making of critical production decisions. While industries utilize social media to interact with customers, businessmen use customer feedback and reviews to better their services and products. Machine learning and Deep learning models are well suited for text processing. Convolutional neural networks and Recurrent neural networks are two deep learning methods that are utilized to solve numerous challenges in the text processing sector. CNN can get the important features from the input text with pooling operation, but it is complex to get contextual data. RNN can get the contextual detail but the sequence of input words will differ.

This ha/s led to the need for increase in security in IoT systems. Innovative and novel techniques are used by the intruders to accomplish malicious goals effectively through cyber-attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used for classification of attacks in IoT networks based on anomaly detection and machine learning techniques. Inefficiency is observed in the conventional machine learning models and intrusion detection techniques as the network technologies are unpredictable. Accurate identification of various anomalies is possible with deep learning models in several research segments. The input data along with its prominent characteristics may be categorized automatically for classification and anomaly detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Faster computations are enabled due to the performance efficiency of CNN. For IoT networks, an intrusion detection model based on anomaly detection is designed and developed in this paper. A multiclass classification framework is created initially using a CNN model. Further, 3D CNN is used for implementation of the proposed model. Various intrusion detection datasets from IoT networks are used for validation of the proposed CNN model. Pre-trained multiclass CNN model is used for implementation of multiclass and binary classification based on transfer learning. When compared to the conventional deep learning models, the proposed multiclass and binary classification framework has attained improved F1 score, recall, precision and accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Solid modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Transfer learning","Intrusion detection","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Network","Network security","Transfer learning","Deep learning","Machine learning","Internet of Things"]}],"doi":"10.1109/I-SMAC52330.2021.9640700","publicationTitle":"2021 Fifth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Fifth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9640538/9640622/09640700.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9640622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I-SMAC52330.2021.9640700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of IoT Network using Deep Learning-based Model for Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9640700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of IoT Network using Deep Learning-based Model for Anomaly Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9640700/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9640700/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of IoT Network using Deep Learning-based Model for Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Palladam, India","sourcePdf":"35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099234S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9640538","isNumber":"9640622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9640538","xplore-issue":"9640622","articleId":"9640700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9640736,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Nuthakki","affiliation":["Atria Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Nuthakki","id":"37086286849"},{"name":"Payel Masanta","affiliation":["Atria Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Payel","lastName":"Masanta","id":"37089199217"},{"name":"Yukta T N","affiliation":["Atria Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Yukta","lastName":"T N","id":"37089199870"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2642-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2641-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2643-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0673"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0665"}],"articleNumber":"9640736","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Mean square error methods","Speech enhancement","Distortion","Time measurement","Convolutional neural networks","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Enhancement","Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","Loss Functions","Speech Intelligibility","Harris Hawks Optimization","Coherence Speech Intelligibility Index","Estimated Short Time Objective Intelligibility","Mean Square Error","Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9640736","doi":"10.1109/I-SMAC52330.2021.9640736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I-SMAC52330.2021.9640736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9640622","publicationTitle":"2021 Fifth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Fifth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9640538/9640622/09640736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Enhancement based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network","abstract":"Speech enhancement is the process of treating noisy speech signals so as to improve human perception as well as improve system understanding of the signal. For speech signals with medium or high signal to noise ratio (SNR), the aim is to produce subjectively pragmatic signal, and for signals having low SNR the aim is to reduce the noise while still maintaining the intelligibility. Many noise reduction algorithms improve overall speech quality but little progress has been made to improve the overall speech intelligibility. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) speech enhancement method by enhancing loss function such as extended short time objective ineligibility (ESTOI) and mean square error (MSE). These loss functions are improved using Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO). The enhanced speech signal is acquired by separating the clean speech signal from the noisy speech signal. By using various predictive measure of objective speech intelligibility like short time objective intelligibility, source to artefact ratio (SAR), coherence speech intelligibility index (CSII) and source to distortion ratio (SDR), the efficacy of speech enhancement is calculated. The quality of the enhanced speech signal is assessed using the quality measure such as speech distortion (SD) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9640736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9640736/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2021","publicationDate":"11 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speech Enhancement based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Enhancement based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Palladam, India","sourcePdf":"134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057163S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9640538","isNumber":"9640622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9640538","xplore-issue":"9640622","articleId":"9640736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9641046,"authors":[{"name":"Sajeev Ram Arumugam","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Sajeev","lastName":"Ram Arumugam","id":"37089202872"},{"name":"Sankar Ganesh Karuppasamy","affiliation":["Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R&D Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sankar","lastName":"Ganesh Karuppasamy","id":"37089203707"},{"name":"Sheela Gowr","affiliation":["Vels Institute of Science Technology and Advanced Studies(VISTAS), Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sheela","lastName":"Gowr","id":"37089202153"},{"name":"Oswalt Manoj","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Oswalt","lastName":"Manoj","id":"37089027681"},{"name":"K Kalaivani","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Kalaivani","id":"37088763139"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2642-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2641-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2643-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0673"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0665"}],"articleNumber":"9641046","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9641046","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Autism","Convolution","Magnetic resonance imaging","Medical treatment","Machine learning","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD)","Autism detection","Face recognition","Neural Network","Functional magnetic resonance imaging( fMRI)","CNN","Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"]}],"abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) a development disability which causes several challenges in social, communication and behaviour abilities.

Grid operators must detect as well as classify the current system operating conditions like normal or faulty from the current raw sets of measurement data available at supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. With the rapid deployment of micro PMUs, faults are detected from the raw measurements in real time, but their classification still possess a challenging task. This paper focuses on a diligent comparison between several deep and machine learning techniques for classifying faults in real time. In real life scenarios, line to ground (L-G) faults being the most frequent one while three phase to ground (LLL-G) faults being rare, an imbalanced dataset is generally developed for supervised learning approach leading to biased classification of faults. In order to alleviate this current concern, data oversampling policy over the imbalanced dataset based on synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is proposed. The dataset used in this work is derived from the Drexel University's Reconfigurable Distribution Automation and Control (RDAC) software/hardware laboratory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9641078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/R10-HTC53172.2021.9641580","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 9th Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 9th Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9641075/9641078/09641580.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/R10-HTC53172.2021.9641580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Faults in Power System with Probabilistic Neural Networks: An Imbalanced Learning Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 2 2021","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Faults in Power System with Probabilistic Neural Networks: An Imbalanced Learning Approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9641580/","publicationDate":"30 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9641580/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Faults in Power System with Probabilistic Neural Networks: An Imbalanced Learning Approach","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"R10HTC2021228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094874S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 2 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9641075","isNumber":"9641078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9641075","xplore-issue":"9641078","articleId":"9641580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9641850,"authors":[{"name":"Amal Ezzouhri","affiliation":["TIC Laboratory, International University of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco","ERSC Team, Mohammadia School of Engineering, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9641850/ezzou-3133797-small.gif","p":["Amal Ezzouhri received the B.S. degree in mathematics and computer science, and the M.Sc. degree in data science from the Faculty of Science Dhar Mahraz, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco, in 2016 and 2018, respectively.

We consider ten driving activities, which consist of one normal driving and nine distracted driving behaviors. Nine drivers were included in the experiments, and each one was asked to perform the ten activities in naturalistic and simulated driving situations. The main feature of the proposed solution is the extraction of the driver\u2019s body parts, using deep learning-based segmentation, before performing the distraction detection and classification task. Experimental results show that the segmentation module significantly improves the classification performance.

When channel state information is available at the transmitter, the proposed scheme designs the analog precoder and combiners by iteratively factorizing the matrices for fully digital precoding and combining, respectively, using the alternating optimization technique. Then, the digital precoder and combiners are obtained through block diagonalization of effective MU-MIMO channels composed of the analog precoder, MU-MIMO channels, and analog combiners, in order to eliminate inter-user interferences. Moreover, focusing on rate balancing among users, we derive a new power allocation algorithm that exploits a modified gradient descent method. The proposed method iteratively adjusts the power allocated to each user in terms of maximizing the minimum user rate. Through numerical simulations, we verify the convergence of the proposed design procedure for hybrid precoding and combining. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed method outperforms the conventional hybrid precoding and combining methods for rate balancing as well as achieves the minimum user rate close to the performance

Network From Multichannel Satellite Imagery","abstract":"Estimating tropical cyclone (TC) intensity is the first step in the processes of monitoring and predicting destructive TC disasters. Due to the dilemma of meteorological methods, accurate estimation of TC intensity is a long-term challenge. In recent years, while deep learning methods have been applied to TC intensity estimation, most of them fail to make full use of multichannel satellite imageries to consider the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of TC. In this letter, we propose a novel deep learning model (3DAttentionTCNet) to overcome this shortcoming. The model can automatically extract 3-D environment information related to TC intensity from multichannel satellite observation imageries such as infrared (IR), water vapor (WV), and passive microwave rainrate (PMW) satellite imageries by 3-D convolution. In addition, we employ the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to simulate visual attention for strengthening the model\u2019s attention to core cloud structure and important channels. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed model is 9.48 kts, which is improved by 25% compared to that of the advanced Dvorak technique (ADT) and by 9.2% over that of the traditional deep learning method of TC intensity estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9643042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9643042/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","volume":"19","externalId":"5511105","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation Using Multidimensional Convolutional Neural Network From Multichannel Satellite Imagery","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"42075138, 41875027, 41875184 and 41730961"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Team of \u201cSix Talent Peaks\u201d in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"TD-XYDXX-004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation Using Multidimensional Convolutional Neural Network From Multichannel Satellite Imagery","sourcePdf":"lgrs-tian-3134007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053535S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"9651998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","xplore-issue":"9651998","articleId":"9643042","onlineDate":"08 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9643218,"authors":[{"name":"Fuad Rahman","affiliation":["Apurba Technologies, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fuad","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085796517"},{"name":"Abrar Rahman","affiliation":["The University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abrar","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37088198676"},{"name":"AKM Shahariar Azad Rabby","affiliation":["The University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA","Apurba Technologies, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"AKM Shahariar","lastName":"Azad Rabby","id":"37088070771"},{"name":"Md Jamiur Rahman Rifat","affiliation":["The University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Md Jamiur Rahman","lastName":"Rifat","id":"37089203493"},{"name":"Mridul Banik","affiliation":["Colorado State University, CO, USA","The University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Mridul","lastName":"Banik","id":"37086638602"},{"name":"Md.

GNNs are particularly effective in processing circuit netlists in terms of graphs and leveraging properties of the nodes and their neighborhoods to learn to efficiently discriminate between different types of nodes. Structural analysis can further rectify any registers misclassified as state registers by the GNN by analyzing strongly connected components in the netlist graph.

The key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) Saber is an important module lattice-based PQC, which has been selected as one of the PQC finalists in the ongoing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process. On the other hand, however, efficient hardware implementation of KEM Saber has not been well covered in the literature. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel cyclic-row oriented processing (CROP) strategy for efficient implementation of the key arithmetic operation of KEM Saber, i.e., the polynomial multiplication. The proposed work consists of three layers of interdependent efforts: (i) first of all, we have formulated the main operation of KEM Saber into desired mathematical forms to be further developed into CROP based algorithms, i.e., the basic version and the advanced higher-speed version; (ii) then, we have followed the proposed CROP strategy to innovatively transfer the derived two algorithms into desired polynomial multiplication structures with the help of a series of algorithm-architecture co-implementation techniques; (iii) finally, detailed complexity analysis and implementation results have shown that the proposed polynomial multiplication structures have better area-time complexities than the state-of-the-art solutions. Specifically, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation results show that the proposed design, e.g., the basic version has at least less 11.2% area-delay product (ADP) than the best competing one (Cyclone V device). The proposed high-performance polynomial multipliers offer not only efficient operation for output results delivery but also possess low-complexity feature brought by CROP strategy. The outcome of this work is expected to provide useful references for further development and standardization process of KEM Saber.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD53106.2021.00031","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 39th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 39th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9643591/9643617/09643636.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD53106.2021.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9643617","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9643636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CROP: FPGA Implementation of High-Performance Polynomial Multiplication in Saber KEM based on Novel Cyclic-Row Oriented Processing Strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CROP: FPGA Implementation of High-Performance Polynomial Multiplication in Saber KEM based on Novel Cyclic-Row Oriented Processing Strategy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9643636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9643636/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CROP: FPGA Implementation of High-Performance Polynomial Multiplication in Saber KEM based on Novel Cyclic-Row Oriented Processing Strategy","confLoc":"Storrs, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"321900a130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125277S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9643591","isNumber":"9643617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9643591","xplore-issue":"9643617","articleId":"9643636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9643800,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo C\u00e9sar F.

Building these applications becomes a great challenge since: they are used on large scale systems, have dynamic behavior, must access heterogeneous resources, can share resources from different domains, and must deal with the semantics of different domains. In this sense, platforms are commonly used to support application development, but they do not reduce complexity, are generic and deal with resource abstractions, while applications deal with domain abstractions. To overcome this semantic gap, this work proposes the use of domain specific middleware (DSM) with support for the development of model-driven applications defined in terms of a domain specific modeling language (DSML). To facilitate the definition of languages in different domains and, consequently, the execution of applications built according to these languages, a meta-meta language was defined that wraps the generic concepts used for the management of several domains. Furthermore, operational semantics are represented by models that describe domain-specific operations. The set of these elements associated with a middleware built according to the model-driven approach is defined as Model-Driven Domain-Specific Middleware (MDDSM). Therefore, this work proposes an integrated architecture that combines the use of MD-DSM and a smart cities platform to provide a flexible, robust and complete approach to facilitating the creation and execution of applications for different smart city domains. Thus, in the context of Smart Cities, middleware must deal with both application domain-related abstractions and platform-related abstractions (resources). Furthermore, the use of the model-driven approach allows representing such abstractions and relating domain semantics to generic resources.

However, for cyclists, it may be a challenge to use this mean of transportation in an urban context, since there are plenty of route choices available and each of them may represent a different trade-off between multiple objectives, such as safety and travel distance. These trade-offs depend on cyclist's experience and preferences. Thus, while an experienced cyclist may choose the shortest path between the source and destination points, a beginner may prefer to travel longer distances to cycle in dedicated cycling infrastructures or to avoid motorized traffic. In this paper, it is proposed a simulated annealing algorithm, to achieve an approximated Pareto set. One uses the A-Star algorithm to create an initial solution and propose a perturbation method, which uses the A-Star algorithm, to generate a higher diversity of solutions. The methodology was tested in practical use cases and was able to find a set of quality solutions for the bike routing problem (BRP).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Annealing","Perturbation methods","Transportation","Simulated annealing","Bicycles","Routing","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bike routing","Meta-heuristic","Multi-objective shortest path","Simulated Annealing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCSIC54682.2021.00019","publicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Computer Science and Intelligent Controls (ISCSIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Computer Science and Intelligent Controls (ISCSIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9644231/9644245/09644332.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCSIC54682.2021.00019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm to Solve the Multi-objective Bike Routing Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9644332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm to Solve the Multi-objective Bike Routing Problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9644332/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9644332/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm to Solve the Multi-objective Bike Routing Problem","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"162700a039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115572S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9644231","isNumber":"9644245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9644231","xplore-issue":"9644245","articleId":"9644332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9644633,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Dai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Dai","orcid":"0000-0001-6415-1690"},{"name":"Weimin Su","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Su"},{"name":"Hong Gu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Gu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9644633","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In the above letter \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n, several characters were presented incorrectly.

applications. The achievable accuracy of network synchronization is bounded by measurement errors in both packet ingress and egress timestamps provided by the network adapters. Today\u2019s commodity network adapters provide time-stamps with an accuracy of, at best, 100s of nanoseconds. Improving the accuracy rate of the time-stamp would require a new hardware design and take years to deploy. In this paper, we present Artificial Accurate Time-stamp (AAT), a machine-learning-based software method to improve the accuracy of hardware time-stamps beyond what is provided by the underlying hardware design. We successfully apply this method to remove time-stamping errors caused by varying network traffic patterns and queue variance in the network adapter. Additionally, we demonstrate a real-world application that uses this method to reduce network synchronization error, from over 300 nanoseconds to lower than 30 nanoseconds (a 10x reduction), without changing the hardware or any software in the application layer.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement errors","Telecommunication traffic","Hardware","Software","Synchronization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["networking","network adapters","Machine learning","AI","time-stamping","synchronization","clock-synchronization PTP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00218","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9644634/9644682/09644704.pdf","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Accurate Time-stamp in Network Adapters*","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9644704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Accurate Time-stamp in Network Adapters*","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9644704/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9644704/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 3 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Accurate Time-stamp in Network Adapters*","confLoc":"New York City, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"357400b631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112982S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9644634","isNumber":"9644682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9644634","xplore-issue":"9644682","articleId":"9644704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9644746,"authors":[{"name":"Shiyu Wang","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Embedded System Integration, Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Shiyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089010647"},{"name":"Shengbing Zhang","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Integrated Aero-Space-Ground-Ocean Big Data Application Technology, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Shengbing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37596283100"},{"name":"Jihe Wang","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Embedded System Integration, Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Jihe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085419177"},{"name":"Libo Chang","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Embedded System Integration, Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Libo","lastName":"Chang","id":"37089201266"},{"name":"Liangyou Feng","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Embedded System Integration, Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Liangyou","lastName":"Feng","id":"37089202988"},{"name":"Xiaoya Fan","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Embedded System Integration, Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoya","lastName":"Fan","id":"37289795800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3574-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1193-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9644746","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"abstract":"As the latest generation of digital video coding standard, HEVC has technically optimized multiple modules such as related frame prediction, block processing and entropy coding in the frequency coding and decoding framework. However, flexible and efficient coding algorithms make the amount of calculation in the video decoding and reconstruction process increase dramatically. The energy efficiency of traditional processors is limited, and the decoding calculation process is difficult to meet the current needs of ultra-high-definition video playback. For the most important and time-consuming bitstream analysis and entropy decoding part of the HEVC decoding process, a new hardware architecture strategy is provided, which can effectively improve the HEVC decoding performance. In this paper, the designed data access module, bitstream analysis and entropy decoding unit are simulated and verified. Build an FPGA verification platform, and use the main tier standard test sequence to simulate and verify the designed hardware acceleration architecture. The experimental results show that the hardware architecture of bitstream analysis and entropy decoding designed in this paper can reach the functions and performance indicators specified by the HEVC standard Level-4 main tier, and the bitstream analysis acceleration effect is good. This thesis aims at the current HEVC decoding calculation characteristics, and through the design of hardware architecture verification, it provides new solutions and hardware architecture ideas for subsequent HEVC encoding and decoding performance optimization.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Program processors","Video sequences","Bit rate","Syntactics","Prediction algorithms","Entropy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HEVC","FPGA","bitstream","entropy decoding","video compression"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00157","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9644634/9644682/09644746.pdf","startPage":"1143","endPage":"1150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware architecture design of HEVC entropy decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9644746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware architecture design of HEVC entropy decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9644746/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9644746/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 3 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware architecture design of HEVC entropy decoding","confLoc":"New York City, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"357400b143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112674S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9644634","isNumber":"9644682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9644634","xplore-issue":"9644682","articleId":"9644746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9644766,"authors":[{"name":"Liuhui Ding","affiliation":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Liuhui","lastName":"Ding","id":"37089204629"},{"name":"Dachuan Li","affiliation":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China","Sifakis Research Institute for Trustworthy Autonomous Systems, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Dachuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37087103652"},{"name":"Bowen Liu","firstName":"Bowen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089200822"},{"name":"Wenxing Lan","firstName":"Wenxing","lastName":"Lan","id":"37089198634"},{"name":"Bing Bai","affiliation":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Bai","id":"37089201134"},{"name":"Qi Hao","affiliation":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China","Sifakis Research Institute for Trustworthy Autonomous Systems, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Hao","id":"37403530000"},{"name":"Weipeng Cao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Weipeng","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086558866"},{"name":"Ke Pei","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co.

In this paper, we propose a safe motion planning framework featuring the quantification and propagation of DNN-based perception uncertainties and motion uncertainties. Contributions of this work are twofold: (1) A Bayesian Deep Neural network model which detects 3D objects and quantitatively capture the associated aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of DNNs; (2) An uncertainty-aware motion planning algorithm (PU-RRT) that accounts for uncertainties in object detection and ego-vehicle\u2019s motion. The proposed approaches are validated via simulated complex scenarios built in CARLA. Experimental results show that the proposed motion planning scheme can cope with uncertainties of DNN-based perception and vehicle motion, and improve the operational safety of autonomous vehicles while still achieving desirable efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Solid modeling","Uncertainty","Three-dimensional displays","Object detection","Planning","Trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["n/a"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00118","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9644634/9644682/09644766.pdf","startPage":"826","endPage":"835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capture Uncertainties in Deep Neural Networks for Safe Operation of Autonomous Driving Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9644766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capture Uncertainties in Deep Neural Networks for Safe Operation of Autonomous Driving Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9644766/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9644766/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 3 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capture Uncertainties in Deep Neural Networks for Safe Operation of Autonomous Driving Vehicles","confLoc":"New York City, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"357400a826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154415S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2021-Oct. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9644634","isNumber":"9644682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9644634","xplore-issue":"9644682","articleId":"9644766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9645046,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungmi Lee","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kyungmi Lee (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, in 2018, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2020."]},"firstName":"Kyungmi","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-6406-9515"},{"name":"Anantha P.

In this work, we first examine the methodology for evaluating adversarial robustness that uses the first-order attack methods, and analyze three cases when this evaluation methodology overestimates robustness: 1) numerical saturation of cross-entropy loss, 2) non-differentiable functions in DNNs, and 3) ineffective initialization of the attack methods. For each case, we propose compensation methods that can be easily combined with the existing attack methods, thus provide a more precise evaluation methodology for robustness. Second, we benchmark the relationship between adversarial robustness and inference-time energy at an embedded hardware platform using our proposed evaluation methodology, and demonstrate that this relationship can be obscured by the three cases behind overestimation. Finally, we examine the gap between robustness measured with the attack methods and the verification methods, and show this gap is reduced by our proposed compensation methods. Overall, our work shows that the robustness-energy trade-off has differences from the conventional accuracy-energy trade-off, and highlights importance of the precise evaluation methodology.","doi":"10.1109/OJCAS.2021.3116244","startPage":"843","endPage":"855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of Circuits and

Meanwhile, with the advancements of cloud technologies, there has been a trend to outsource network functions through virtualization to a cloud service provider, so as to alleviate the local burdens on provisioning and managing such hardware resources. Promising as it is, redirecting the communication traffic to a third-party service provider has drawn various security and privacy concerns. Traditional end-to-end encryption can protect the traffic in transmit, but it also hinders data usability. This dilemma has raised wide interests from both industry and academia, and great efforts have been made to realize privacy-preserving network function outsourcing that can guarantee the confidentiality of network communications while preserving the ability to inspect the traffic. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art literature on network function outsourcing, with a special focus on privacy and security issues. We first give a brief introduction to NFV and pinpoint its challenges and security risks in the cloud context. Then, we present detailed descriptions and comparisons of existing secure network function outsourcing schemes in terms of functionality, efficiency, and security. Finally, we conclude by discussing possible future research directions.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3127277","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the

The existence of multiple CISTs in the underlying graph of a network has applications in fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution. In this paper, we investigate the construction of CISTs in a server-centric data center network called BCube connected crossbars (BCCC), which can provide good network performance using inexpensive commodity off-the-shelf switches and commodity servers with only two network interface card (NIC) ports. The significant advantages of BCCC are its good expandability, lower communication latency, and higher robustness in component failure. Based on the structure of compound graphs of BCCC, we provide efficient algorithms to construct \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\lceil \\frac{n}{4}\\rceil$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n CISTs in the logical graph of BCCC, denoted by \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$BCCC(n,k)$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n, for \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n\\geqslant 5$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n. As a by-product, we obtain a fault-tolerant routing that takes the constructed CISTs as its routing table. We then evaluate the performance of the fault-tolerant routing through simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3133595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"1939","endPage":"1952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3133595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09645299.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Routing","Fault tolerant systems","Fault tolerance","Data centers","Compounds","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Completely independent spanning trees (CISTs)","data center networks (DCNs)","BCube connected crossbars (BCCC)","server-centric DCNs","compound graphs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Completely Independent Spanning Trees on BCCC Data Center Networks With an Application to Fault-Tolerant Routing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9645299/","volume":"33","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/9645299/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872257, 62002062 and 62072109"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST-110-2221-E-141-004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Completely Independent Spanning Trees on BCCC Data Center Networks With an Application to Fault-Tolerant Routing","sourcePdf":"tpds-chang-3133595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.327587S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9642402","articleId":"9645299","onlineDate":"09 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9645306,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Shi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9642402/9645306/shi-3133884-small.gif","p":["Tao Shi is currently working toward the PhD degree with the School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.

Therefore, Web application providers face the challenge to select proper cloud services for application replication and deployment with the aim of minimizing the deployment cost. Meanwhile, the deployed application replicas must satisfy the constraint on request response time to maintain the quality of user experience. To meet the two major requirements, this article studies a new problem of Web application replication and deployment in multi-cloud (WARDMC) that jointly considers both the cost minimization and constraints on average response time, including particularly request processing time and network latency. To address the problem, we develop a new approach named MCApp. MCApp combines iterative mixed integer linear programming with domain-tailored large neighborhood search to optimize both application replicas deployment and user requests dispatching. Extensive experiments using the real-world datasets demonstrate that MCApp significantly outperforms several recently proposed approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9645306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9645306/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","volume":"33","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective Web Application Replication and Deployment in Multi-Cloud Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective Web Application Replication and Deployment in Multi-Cloud Environment","sourcePdf":"tpds-shi-3133884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162414S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9642402","articleId":"9645306","onlineDate":"09 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9645321,"authors":[{"name":"Karen Adam","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Adam","orcid":"0000-0002-1700-6623"},{"name":"Adam Scholefield","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Scholefield","orcid":"0000-0002-5083-2185"},{"name":"Martin Vetterli","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Vetterli","orcid":"0000-0002-6122-1216"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9645321","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Videos","Signal resolution","Spatial resolution","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Standards","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Event-based sensing","time encoding","low-rank signals","bandlimited signals","video reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9645321","abstract":"In event-based sensing, many sensors independently and asynchronously emit events when there is a change in their input. Event-based sensing can present significant improvements in power efficiency when compared to traditional sampling, because (1) the output is a stream of events where the important information lies in the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">timing</i>\n of the events, and (2) the sensor can easily be controlled to output information only when interesting activity occurs at the input. Moreover, event-based sampling can often provide better resolution than standard uniform sampling. Not only does this occur because individual event-based sensors have higher temporal resolution (Rebecq et al., 2021) it also occurs because the asynchrony of events within a sensor and therefore across sensors allows for less redundant and more informative encoding. We would like to explain how such curious results come about. To do so, we use ideal time encoding machines as a proxy for event-based sensors. We explore time encoding of signals with low rank structure, and apply the resulting theory to video. We then see how the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">asynchronous</i>\n firing across time encoding machines can couple spatial sampling density with temporal resolution, leading to better reconstruction, whereas, in frame-based video, temporal resolution depends solely on the frame-rate and spatial resolution solely on the pixel grid used.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3133709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3133709","startPage":"105","endPage":"116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09645321.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchrony Increases Efficiency: Time Encoding of Videos and Low-Rank Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Asynchrony Increases Efficiency: Time Encoding of Videos and Low-Rank Signals","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9645321/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9645321/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","grantNumber":"200021_181978/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Asynchrony Increases Efficiency: Time Encoding of Videos and Low-Rank Signals","sourcePdf":"tsp-adam-3133709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100227S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9645321","onlineDate":"09 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9645340,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek Komorowski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Komorowski","orcid":"0000-0001-6906-4318","id":"37086881095"},{"name":"Monika Wysoczanska","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Wysoczanska","id":"37087104566"},{"name":"Tomasz Trzcinski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzcinski","orcid":"0000-0002-1486-8906","id":"37586208900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-3766"},{"format":"CD","value":"2377-3774"}],"articleNumber":"9645340","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"abstract":"The letter presents a deep neural network-based method for global and local descriptors extraction from a point cloud acquired by a rotating 3D LiDAR.

A TIA should have high bandwidth and low power consumption but due to large photodiode capacitance it is difficukt to achieve. This paper presents a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) circuit with high gain and wide bandwidth with vey low noise effect. Author has used inverter based feedback system with always on PMOS and NMOS to reduce the leakage current for nanoelectronics application and increase the bandwidth for wide band and high-speed application. With this topology achieved -3db bandwidth is 8.2 GHz with high gain of 53.2dBohms. The noise effect is 23.36pA/sqHz i.e very low compared to other topologies in 180nm design. The author had used current mirror instead of constant current source thus power dissipation is also very low i.e 3.6mW.

These devices are currently used in fundamental neurophysiology research, and they are moving toward clinical viability for neural rehabilitation. State-of-the-art BCI experiments have often been performed using tethered (wired) setups in controlled laboratory settings. Wired tethers simplify power and data interfaces but restrict the duration and types of experiments that are possible, particularly for the study of sensorimotor pathways in freely behaving animals. To eliminate tethers, there is significant ongoing research to develop fully wireless BCIs having wireless uplink of broadband neural recordings and wireless recharging for long-duration deployment, but significant challenges persist. BCIs must deliver complex functionality while complying with tightly coupled constraints in size, weight, power, noise, and biocompatibility. In this article, we provide an overview of recent progress in wireless BCIs and a detailed presentation of two emerging technologies that are advancing the state of the art: ultralow-power wireless backscatter communication and adaptive inductive resonant (AIR) wireless power transfer (WPT).","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9646246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9646246/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"110","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Wireless Power Transfer and Backscatter Communication for Perpetual Operation of Wireless Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"DGE-1762114"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation Award","grantNumber":"EEC-1028725"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"EEC-1028725"},{"fundingName":"Center for Neurotechnology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007812","fundingName":"University of Washington Institute for Neuroengineering"},{"fundingName":"Washington National Primate Research Center"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DGE-1762114"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Wireless Power Transfer and Backscatter Communication for Perpetual Operation of Wireless Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","sourcePdf":"jproc-smith-3130059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154212S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9675003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","xplore-issue":"9675003","articleId":"9646246","onlineDate":"10 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9646264,"authors":[{"name":"Qingfeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/9670865/9646264/zhang-3125326-small.gif","p":["Qingfeng Zhang (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from the Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China, in 2016.

The mechanisms of gain control and phase variation in CMOS VGA based on single-level transistor structure are analyzed in detail. According to the analysis, an active cross-coupling neutralization (ACCN) technique is proposed. The ACCN technique not only compensates for phase variation, but also makes phase compensation insensitive to the process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. For achieving ultralow gain error, an asymmetric capacitive gain resolution improvement (ACGRI) technique is adopted, which realizes a fine gain step with low control circuit complexity. Further to reduce gain error, greatly improving the accuracy and robustness against PVT of gain control is necessary. With regard to this, a current-type digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is also integrated onto the chip. The proposed VGA is demonstrated in 65-nm CMOS technology with a core chip area of 0.14 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. Under 5-b digital gain control conditions, the presented VGA achieves a measured linear gain tunability range of 6.2 dB with a 0.2-dB fine tuning step. The measured root mean square (rms) phase error is less than 0.92\u00b0 across 24\u201328 GHz with a minimum value of 0.63\u00b0 at 27.8 GHz. The rms gain error is less than 0.13 dB, with a minimum value of only 0.03 dB at 25 GHz. At the maximum gain state, the proposed CS VGA exhibits a peak gain of 29.4 dB with 3-dB bandwidth of 23.5\u201327.5 GHz and the minimum noise figure is 4.8 dB at 26 GHz. Besides, the measured OP\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1dB</sub>\n and OP\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3dB</sub>\n are 6.3 and 9.6 dBm, respectively.

We further show that the posit-based multiplier requires higher power-delay-product (PDP) and area, whereas fixed-posit reduces PDP and area consumption by 71% and 36%, respectively, compared to (Devnath \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i>\n, 2020) for the same bit-width.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3131609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9686552/09646478.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3131609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Low-Power Quantized Fixed Posit High-Accuracy DNN Implementation","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9646478/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9646478/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) through the SMDP-C2SD and the Young Faculty Research Fellowship (YFRF) Visvesvaraya Ph.D. Scheme"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008628","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)","grantNumber":"CRG/2018/005013, MTR/2019/001605 and SPR/2020/000450"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)","grantNumber":"2020-IR-2980"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Low-Power Quantized Fixed Posit High-Accuracy DNN Implementation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-walia-3131609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058995S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9686552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9686552","articleId":"9646478","onlineDate":"10 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":9646488,"authors":[{"name":"Tassnim Dardouri","affiliation":["L2TI, UR 3043, Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Nord, Villetaneuse, France"],"firstName":"Tassnim","lastName":"Dardouri","orcid":"0000-0001-5100-4747","id":"37088688819"},{"name":"Mounir Kaaniche","affiliation":["L2TI, UR 3043, Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Nord, Villetaneuse, France"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Kaaniche","orcid":"0000-0003-1874-3243","id":"38274151500"},{"name":"Amel Benazza-Benyahia","affiliation":["LR11TIC01, COSIM Laboratory, SUP\u2019COM, University of Carthage, El Ghazala, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Benazza-Benyahia","orcid":"0000-0002-4562-2757","id":"38272348100"},{"name":"Jean-Christophe Pesquet","affiliation":["Centre de Vision Num\u00e9rique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Inria, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Christophe","lastName":"Pesquet","orcid":"0000-0002-5943-8061","id":"37273800000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"9646488","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Transform coding","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Image reconstruction","Convolutional neural networks","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lifting scheme","image compression","adaptive wavelets","optimization","neural networks","adaptive learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9646488","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2021.3132825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2021.3132825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9626658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/9626658/09646488.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Neural Network for Lossy-to-Lossless Image Coding","abstract":"Lifting-based wavelet transform has been extensively used for efficient compression of various types of visual data. Generally, the performance of such coding schemes strongly depends on the lifting operators used, namely the prediction and update filters. Unlike conventional schemes based on linear filters, we propose, in this paper, to learn these operators by exploiting neural networks. More precisely, a classical Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) architecture is firstly employed to perform the prediction and update. Then, we propose to improve this FCNN-based Lifting Scheme (LS) in order to better take into account the input image to be encoded. Thus, a novel dynamical FCNN model is developed, making the learning process adaptive to the input image contents for which two adaptive learning techniques are proposed. While the first one resorts to an iterative algorithm where the computation of two kinds of variables is performed in an alternating manner, the second learning method aims to learn the model parameters directly through a reformulation of the loss function. Experimental results carried out on various test images show the benefits of the proposed approaches in the context of lossy and lossless image compression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9646488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9646488/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","publicationDate":"2022","pubMedId":"34890328","volume":"31","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Neural Network for Lossy-to-Lossless Image Coding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research and Teaching Chair in Artificial Intelligence BRIDinG thE gAp Between iterative proximaL methods and nEural networks (BRIDGEABLE)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"French National Research Agency (ANR)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004795","fundingName":"Institut Universitaire de France"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Neural Network for Lossy-to-Lossless Image Coding","sourcePdf":"tip-dardouri-3132825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144351S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9626658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9626658","articleId":"9646488","onlineDate":"10 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9646878,"authors":[{"name":"Nadeem Javaid","affiliation":["COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI), Islamabad, Pakistan","School of Computer Science, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9646878/javai-3134754-small.gif","p":["Nadeem Javaid (Senior Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, in 1995, the master\u2019s degree in electronics from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Paris-Est, France, in 2010.

The recent development in the advanced metering infrastructure brings opportunities for experts to identify the electricity thieves in the smart grid community. Many advancements are made in the area of the smart grid for Electricity Theft Detection (ETD), where the data collected from the smart meters is utilized. However, the problems of imbalanced distribution of data and inaccurate classification are not efficiently addressed. Therefore, to overcome the problems, machine learning and deep learning models are proposed for ETD. Initially, to refine the smart meters\u2019 data, pre-processing methods are used. Then, the class imbalance problem is solved through Synthetic Minority Oversampling Tomek Links (ST-Links). It solves the classifier\u2019s biasness problem, which occurs due to imbalanced data. It achieves the benefits of both data oversampling and undersampling. Afterwards, an AlexNet and peephole long short-term memory network based feature extractor with an attention layer is developed to extract the relevant features from electricity consumption profiles that are most suitable to classify honest and theft consumers. After the extraction of suitable features, the classification of consumers is performed by an echo state neural network. Moreover, an evolutionary grey wolf optimization technique is utilized to tune the hyper-parameters of the proposed model. A paired t-test is also applied on the final classification results for a reliable assessment of the proposed model. The simulations are conducted on a realistic smart meters\u2019 dataset of China to check the performance of the proposed model. In addition, different benchmark models are implemented to perform a comparative analysis. Different meaningful performance metrics are considered for the fair evaluation of the proposed model: Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), F1-score, Area Under Curve (AUC), precision and recall. The simulation results depict that the proposed model obtains accuracy, recall, F1-score, AUC, PR-AUC, precision and MCC score of 96.3%, 92.1%, 92.0%, 96.4%, 97.3%, 90.0% and 84.0%, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the application of the proposed solution is quite general. Therefore, it can be used by the power companies to overcome the power losses in the energy sector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and

Thus, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been widely adopted, in recent studies, to solve this forecasting problem. However, there is not a consolidated methodology which defines the better combination of some ANN parameters, such as the number of historical data in the input and neurons in the hidden layer. Therefore, in this paper, the authors proposed an optimization methodology which minimizes the Mean Absolute percentage error (MAPE), considering the lowest amount of historical data in the input and neurons in the hidden layer. Thus, this study compared a modified Cuckoo Search (CS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) performance with the exhaustive search, in order to validate the optimization methodology results. It was possible to notice, from the results, that the CS presented lower MAPE than the PSO, and both presented a considerably lower processing time than trial-and-error.","doi":"10.1109/URUCON53396.2021.9647366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URUCON53396.2021.9647366","startPage":"132","endPage":"137","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE URUCON","pdfPath":"/iel7/9647037/9647044/09647366.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE URUCON","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Model of Artificial Neural Network-Cuckoo Search for Irradiance and Load Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Model of Artificial Neural Network-Cuckoo Search for Irradiance and Load Forecasting","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2021","publicationDate":"24 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9647366/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9647366/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior - Brazil (CAPES)","grantNumber":"001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Model of Artificial Neural Network-Cuckoo Search for Irradiance and Load Forecasting","confLoc":"Montevideo, Uruguay","sourcePdf":"1570748746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092016S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9647037","isNumber":"9647044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9647037","xplore-issue":"9647044","articleId":"9647366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9647677,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Recent approaches to solve this problem rely on either the use of unequal error protection through additional channel encoding/decoding or precoding in the form of antenna-dependent rotation (or joint rotation and amplitude scaling) of the signal constellation. The precoding based approaches achieve good results for small number of transmit antennas and for small constellations such as BPSK and QPSK, but the performance quickly degrades for higher-level signal constellations. Moreover, the complexity of the precoder optimization problem increases with the number of transmit antennas and the modulation order, making this approach not very practical to use for high spectral efficiencies. This paper introduces a novel approach to this problem, which is particularly suited for high-level signal constellations. This is achieved by the joint use of dual-polarized antennas and of active-antenna dependent signature constellations which are derived from each other through successive geometric interpolations. The theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that compared to previous methods it gives significant performance improvements in terms of robustness to transmit antenna correlation, particularly for Rician fading channels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM53176.2021.9647765","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9647714/9647733/09647765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM53176.2021.9647765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signature Spatial Modulation Using Dual-Polarized Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Signature Spatial Modulation Using Dual-Polarized Antennas","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9647765/","publicationDate":"17 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9647765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signature Spatial Modulation Using Dual-Polarized Antennas","confLoc":"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic","sourcePdf":"219429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051102S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9647714","isNumber":"9647733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9647714","xplore-issue":"9647733","articleId":"9647765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9647770,"authors":[{"name":"F\u00e1tima Sayury Queralt Queda Alves","affiliation":["National Institute of Telecommunications - Inatel, Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, MG, Brazil"],"firstName":"F\u00e1tima","lastName":"Sayury Queralt Queda Alves","id":"37089206744"},{"name":"Lucas dos Santos Costa","affiliation":["National Institute of Telecommunications - Inatel, Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, MG, Brazil"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"dos Santos Costa","id":"37085511905"},{"name":"Rausley A.

Designers usually deploy these clouds hierarchically to get the best advantage of low latency of the edge clouds and high processing capabilities of the core clouds. The data that flows into the clouds for processing and storage and moves out to other system domains for further use must cross multiple trust boundaries, and as a result, face large attack surfaces. This gives malicious actors abundant opportunity to penetrate and potentially harm organizations or bring down critical services causing widespread disruptions and mayhem. Deep neural network models can be used in innovative ways to protect the confidentiality and integrity of dataflows in the clouds. However, the use of deep learning comes with some challenges. In large multi-location and multi-cloud environments, deep learning models grow rapidly in size and complexity, inhibiting fast training of cloud models and making it difficult to maintain accuracy of detection of known and unknown attacks on the data-in-motion. This impedes their use in critical infrastructure services. We propose innovative distributed-hierarchical-merged models, which make use of cooperative training at the edge and the core clouds, and the power of data and model parallelisms, to achieve rapid training with high accuracy. Our broad objectives in this paper are twofold: Firstly, we show that merged hierarchical deep learning models, working cooperatively in the multi-cloud, significantly reduce the parameters to be trained and results in faster core cloud training time. Secondly, training the merged core model with distribute strategy for data parallelism on CPUs and GPUs further reduces the training time significantly. We also show that while achieving improvement by about 25% over unmerged models and the accuracy of detection of unknown attacks in the range 96.9-99.5%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Privacy","Organizations","Parallel processing","Data models","Critical infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["performance","multi-cloud","edge clouds","core clouds","deep neural networks","stacked sparse autoencoders","hierarchical models","distributed models","data parallelism","model parallelism"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PST52912.2021.9647771","publicationTitle":"2021 18th International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 18th International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9647713/9647738/09647771.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PST52912.2021.9647771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Securing Critical Infrastructure Through Innovative Use Of Merged Hierarchical Deep Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9647771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Securing Critical Infrastructure Through Innovative Use Of Merged Hierarchical Deep Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9647771/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9647771/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Securing Critical Infrastructure Through Innovative Use Of Merged Hierarchical Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper_50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071261S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9647713","isNumber":"9647738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9647713","xplore-issue":"9647738","articleId":"9647771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9647828,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Kody\u0161","affiliation":["ST Engineering, Cyber Security Strategic Technology Centre, Singapore"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kody\u0161","id":"37087863658"},{"name":"Zhi Lu","affiliation":["ST Engineering, Cyber Security Strategic Technology Centre, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37089204528"},{"name":"Kar Wai Fok","affiliation":["ST Engineering, Cyber Security Strategic Technology Centre, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kar Wai","lastName":"Fok","id":"37089199633"},{"name":"Vrizlynn L.

As security mechanisms are often neglected during the deployment of IoT devices, they are more easily attacked by complicated and large volume intrusion attacks using advanced techniques. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used by the cyber security community in the past decade to automatically identify such attacks. However, deep learning methods have yet to be extensively explored for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) specifically for IoT. Most recent works are based on time sequential models like LSTM and there is short of research in CNNs as they are not naturally suited for this problem. In this article, we propose a novel solution to the intrusion attacks against IoT devices using CNNs. The data is encoded as the convolutional operations to capture the patterns from the sensors data along time that are useful for attacks detection by CNNs. The proposed method is integrated with two classical CNNs: ResNet and EfficientNet, where the detection performance is evaluated. The experimental results show significant improvement in both true positive rate and false positive rate compared to the baseline using LSTM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9647828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9647828/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2021","publicationDate":"13 Dec. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things using Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper_51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137798S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9647713","isNumber":"9647738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9647713","xplore-issue":"9647738","articleId":"9647828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9647834,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Romero Reyes","affiliation":["Chair for Communication Networks, Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Romero Reyes","id":"37086250010"},{"name":"Thomas Bauschert","affiliation":["Chair for Communication Networks, Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Bauschert","id":"37318277900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4035-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4036-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"9647834","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"abstract":"Monte Carlo and temporal-difference control, Q-Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are well-established methods to solve problems modelled as Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Within these type of problems, the connection admission control (CAC) and routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem is of particular interest in optical networks. Recent research has applied DRL to solve the RSA problem. This work, however, does not completely disclose the strengths and weaknesses of DRL-based RSA since published results mainly present performance comparisons against k-shortest path methods, which are known to be outperformed by exact and heuristic optimization strategies. Furthermore, these methods overlook the state representations and the definition of deterministic policy from the MDP network model. To fill this gap, in this paper we show that by modelling resource allocation as an MDP process, it is possible to unveil properties that can be regarded in the design of approximate solution methods such as DRL. We formulate both the reward maximization problem for CAC & RSA and the definition of the concept of deterministic policy. By applying a policy iteration algorithm, we illustrate that optimum decisions on CAC & RSA depend on the traffic load and on the bandwidth of connections. We also provide a set of guidelines that can be applied for the design of adaptive DRL-based CAC & RSA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Q-learning","Process control","Telecommunication traffic","Optical fiber networks","Markov processes","Routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Reinforcement Learning","Markov Decision Processes","Routing and Spectrum Assignment","Optical Networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM53176.2021.9647834","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9647714/9647733/09647834.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM53176.2021.9647834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards DRL-based Routing and Spectrum Assignment in Optical Networks: Lessons to be Learned from Markov Decision Processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9647834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards DRL-based Routing and Spectrum Assignment in Optical Networks: Lessons to be Learned from Markov Decision Processes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9647834/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"17 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9647834/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards DRL-based Routing and Spectrum Assignment in Optical Networks: Lessons to be Learned from Markov Decision Processes","confLoc":"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic","sourcePdf":"219094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094119S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9647714","isNumber":"9647733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9647714","xplore-issue":"9647733","articleId":"9647834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9647875,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"9647875","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2020-2021 Index IEEE Transactions on Computers Vol. 70","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9647875","doi":"10.1109/TC.2021.3134810","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/9605655/09647875.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2021.3134810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9605655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9647875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"2020-2021 Index IEEE Transactions on Computers Vol. 70","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2020-2021 Index IEEE Transactions on Computers Vol. 70","sourcePdf":"tc-index-3134810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03305S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9605655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","articleId":"9647875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9647920,"authors":[{"name":"Karim A.

Then, we obtain an upper bound for the tail energy of DPSS correlation sequences. Finally, we obtain a lower bound for the concentration ratio of DPSS correlation sequences. All derived bounds require knowledge of the following parameters for each DPSS sequence in the correlation pair: corresponding eigen-value, Fourier transform evaluated at two special frequency points, derivative of the Fourier transform evaluated at the same two points.

We present a novel, non-iterative data-driven approach. Specifically, our algorithm works in the frequency-domain, where it tries to mimic the optimal unrealizable non-linear Wiener-like filter as if the unknown deterministic signal were known. This leads to a threshold-type regularized estimator, where the threshold at each frequency is determined in a data-driven manner. We perform a theoretical analysis of our proposed estimator, and derive approximate formulas for its Mean Squared Error (MSE) at both low and high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes. We show that in the low SNR regime our method provides enhanced noise suppression, and in the high SNR regime it approaches the optimal unrealizable solution. Further, as we demonstrate in simulations, our solution is highly suitable for (approximately) bandlimited or frequency-domain sparse signals, and provides a significant gain of several dBs relative to other methods in the resulting MSE.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3133710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3133710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","startPage":"468","endPage":"481","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09648019.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9648019","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deconvolution","Signal to noise ratio","Optimized production technology","Signal processing algorithms","Convolution","Frequency estimation","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deconvolution","thresholding","Wiener filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"\u201cSelf-Wiener\u201d Filtering: Data-Driven Deconvolution of Deterministic Signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9648019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9648019/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cSelf-Wiener\u201d Filtering: Data-Driven Deconvolution of Deterministic Signals","sourcePdf":"tsp-weiss-3133710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105275S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9648019","onlineDate":"13 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9648039,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchen Jiao","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology and the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuchen","lastName":"Jiao"},{"name":"Xingyu Xu","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology and the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xingyu","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-7056-8748"},{"name":"Yuantao Gu","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology and the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuantao","lastName":"Gu","orcid":"0000-0002-8427-1021"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9648039","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9648039","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Sensors","Signal processing algorithms","Bandwidth","Detection algorithms","Delays","Protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change-point detection","decentralized algorithms","CUSUM","differential quantization","error feedback"]}],"abstract":"Change-Point Detection (CPD) has been researched for a long time in statistical signal processing, and has been widely used in many applications such as monitoring and anomaly detection. When detecting over networks, existing algorithms require sensors to exchange information via transmitting full-precision variables, which requires large bandwidth and consumes a large amount of energy. To address these problems, we explore the idea of quantizing data with low precision without deteriorating the detection performance. Specifically, considering the strong autocorrelation of the transmitted sequence in time domain and the accumulation of quantization error due to the autocorrelation, we design a scheme that combines the differential quantization technique and the error feedback technique. Based on this scheme, we propose a communication-efficient decentralized CPD algorithm named Quantized CUSUM (Q-CUSUM), which only requires small bandwidth and has low energy consumption. We theoretically analyze two commonly-used detection criteria, namely Average Run Length (ARL) and Expected Detection Delay (EDD), and compute their theoretical bounds. It is proved that the detection performance is robust to the quantization error. The proposed quantization scheme can be easily extended to the partial-communication case, where at each time only a subset of sensor pairs are allowed to exchange information. Experiments are implemented on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that the proposed quantization scheme can effectively reduce the communication cost without deteriorating the detection performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3134885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09648039.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"157","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3134885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantization for Communication-Efficient Change-Point Detection Over Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Quantization for Communication-Efficient Change-Point Detection Over Networks","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9648039/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9648039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971266"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua Precision Medicine Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization for Communication-Efficient Change-Point Detection Over Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-gu-3134885-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.207234S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9648039","onlineDate":"13 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9648156,"authors":[{"name":"Moldir Yerzhanova","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Yongin, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9648156/yerzh-3134961-small.gif","p":["Moldir Yerzhanova received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan, in 2018.

To support massive connectivity of such energy-constrained IoT devices, a monostatic multiantenna backscatter communication network (MBCN) with beamforming has emerged, for which reliable channel estimation is indispensable. This paper tackles backscatter and forward channel estimation problems for a monostatic MBCN in a generalized fading model, where the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) solutions are too intricate to derive due to the complicated distribution function of the cascaded backscatter channel. After deriving the linear MMSE (LMMSE) estimator of the backscatter channel in the generalized fading model, we propose learning-based estimators based on the fast and flexible convolutional neural network (FFDNet) toward the optimal solution. We also propose a deep neural network (DNN) with a customized loss function that estimates the forward channel coefficients directly from the backscattered signal. The results show that the proposed FFDNet-based estimator for the backscatter channel reduces the MSE of the LMMSE estimator by a factor of two or three. In addition, the DNN-based estimator for the forward channel is shown to reduce the pilot overhead up to by half when compared with the conventional estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9648156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9648156/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation via Model and Learning for Monostatic Multiantenna Backscatter Communication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)","grantNumber":"NRF-2021R1A2C1005869"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) under the Information Technology Research Center Support Program","grantNumber":"IITP-2021-0-02046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Channel Estimation via Model and Learning for Monostatic Multiantenna Backscatter Communication","sourcePdf":"access-kim-3134961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112321S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9648156","onlineDate":"13 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9648389,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Pilia","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Pilia","id":"37089205991"},{"name":"Sara Mandelli","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Mandelli","id":"37086337144"},{"name":"Paolo Bestagini","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Bestagini","id":"37601538000"},{"name":"Stefano Tubaro","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Tubaro","id":"37273801800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1717-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1716-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1718-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4774"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2157-4766"}],"articleNumber":"9648389","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9648389","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Fourier transforms","Forensics","Estimation","Software","Robustness","Convolutional neural networks"]}],"abstract":"The widespread diffusion of user friendly editing software for audio signals has made audio tampering extremely accessible to anyone. Therefore, it is increasingly necessary to develop forensic methodologies aiming at verifying if a given audio content has been digitally manipulated or not. Among the multiple available audio editing techniques, a very common one is time scaling, i.e., altering the temporal evolution of an audio signal without affecting any pitch component. For instance, this can be used to slow-down or speed-up speech recordings, thus enabling the creation of natural sounding fake speech compositions. In this work, we propose to blindly detect and estimate the time scaling applied to an audio signal.

Reliable estimation of the quantity of strawberry fruit with respect to their ripeness level is critical for forecasting the upcoming strawberry production. Typically, the quantity and ripeness of fruits are estimated manually, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this case, automated yield prediction based on robotic agriculture is a realistic option. We provide in this study an automated strawberry fruit recognition and counting system for accurate and reliable yield prediction. This paper proposes a unique neural network training approach for strawberry fruit counting and ripeness detection that combines semantic graphics for data annotation with a fully convolutional neural network (FCN). Semantic graphics, the suggested data annotation approach, is straightforward to apply, and the desired targets can be quickly tagged with little effort. Moreover, the proposed FCN is an enhanced encoder-decoder network designed specifically for efficient learning of semantic graphics. Quantitative analysis of proposed algorithm showed 4.47% increase in detection accuracy over prior techniques while running at higher frames per second.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics","Deep learning","Image segmentation","Annotations","Semantics","Estimation","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semantic graphics","yield forecasting","crop management","segmentation","deep learning","encoder-decoder cnn"]}],"doi":"10.23919/ICCAS52745.2021.9649871","publicationTitle":"2021 21st International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 21st International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9649656/9648842/09649871.pdf","startPage":"1835","endPage":"1841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9648842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ICCAS52745.2021.9649871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Learning Based Approach for Strawberry Yield Prediction via Semantic Graphics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9649871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning Based Approach for Strawberry Yield Prediction via Semantic Graphics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9649871/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"12 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9649871/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)","grantNumber":"NRF- 2019R1A6A1A09031717"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Learning Based Approach for Strawberry Yield Prediction via Semantic Graphics","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"FB2-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129079S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9649656","isNumber":"9648842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9649656","xplore-issue":"9648842","articleId":"9649871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"}]
